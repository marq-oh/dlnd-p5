/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<hr>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>
<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Instructions">&#182;</a></h2><p>Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

 {&#39;pos&#39;: [&#34;I grew up watching this movie ,and I still love it just as much today as when i was a kid. Don&#39;t listen to the critic reviews. They are not accurate on this film.Eddie Murphy really shines in his roll.You can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.I recommend this movie to everybody to see. It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.With demons ,dragons,and a little bald kid with God like powers.This movie takes you from L.A. to Tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in Tibet.Just a beautiful view! So go do your self a favor and snatch this one up! You wont regret it!&#34;,
   &#39;The film was okay, quite entertaining. The cast was pretty good, and I\&#39;ll second what the comment before me mentioned - Glenn Quinn was outstanding and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He played the selfish &#34;evil&#34; friend and manager of the band brilliantly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of songs performed by &#34;Beyond Gravity&#34; in this film, but this doesn\&#39;t really come as a surprise considering the film is a VH1 production. However, if the soft rock/ pop music isn\&#39;t to someone\&#39;s liking one might as well flash forward those scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of a band trying to make it to the top in L.A. but having to overcome many obstacles on the way isn\&#39;t too original, but quite entertaining, with some surprising plot turns here and there.&#39;,
   &#34;I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and just out of high school I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Laborers and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc. for one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward San Diego. Just short of there we stopped at an army base called either Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into Camp Pendleton, the big Marine base. There, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific island base. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gun entrenchments, sand-bagged trenches and living quarters. All this was at very high pay, sometimes &#39;golden time&#39;, which was triple our regular hourly wage. Our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch, etc. - which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the job was finished I waited eagerly for the movie to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen. Then it was no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the movie&#39;s heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens. A bit disappointing, but still fun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of the disappointment I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. I learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and Fox was paid on a cost plus basis, which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there. Bob Weverka&#34;,
   &#34;This film to me is a very good film!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a German Shepherd myself and I wish to god he was like Jerry Lee!! I hope too that there is another K-9 in the running!! With Jerry Lee and Dooley in them!! I don&#39;t care what any one say these two films were excellent!!&#34;,
   &#34;This cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters. Especially, of course, the two leading characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she couldn&#39;t stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer. So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, an untidy, unreliable sports-reporter who lives in divorce from his ex-wife in a bachelor apartment. He offers his distressed friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can&#39;t live together for a long time. Felix turns Oscar&#39;s disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat. He cleans and cooks the whole time. After a short while, Oscar feels persecution mania ... Filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted. Above all, Jack Lemmon&#39;s play is wonderful. He is the perfect clown. He makes us laugh but in a tragi-comic way. Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper, because Oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling-ball. While he is preparing the drinks, Felix sits with the two young ladies in the living-room. To get out of this embarrassing situation, he starts to talk about the weather. A minute later, he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he begins to weep and when Oscar comes back with the drinks, there are three weeping people in the living-room. The film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes. An intelligent, entertaining comedy with much heart. 10 out of 10!&#34;,
   &#34;This movie has made me want to become a director, and Michelle Rodriguez is brilliant. How the hell wasn&#39;t she on mtv&#39;s top 25 under 25, she beats them all. This film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance, best film i have ever seen.&#34;,
   &#34;The title says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not a film critic nor will I act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this movie didn&#39;t have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great! It looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but I imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll definitely be checking out other movies produced by Brain Damage Films! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan O&#39;Leary, cast and crew, I thank you!&#34;,
   &#39;*some spoilers*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms (acting, dated dialogue, unclear storyline) unfounded. Belafonte is great as a Brandoesque, menacing, swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so. He learns too late how empty his hustling, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife Fanny. In spite of his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) in one. The two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other, the result being hilarious and touchingly sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film. After looking everywhere for Belafonte, Mostel looks up to see a falling feather, and he frantically reaches for it as if he\&#39;s finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte wasn\&#39;t allowed to finish his miracle (either to restore Fanny\&#39;s health or Mostel\&#39;s faith), so he never got his wings. The feather floats tauntingly out of Mostel\&#39;s grasp, a metaphor for both men\&#39;s live: it\&#39;s too late and you don\&#39;t get a second chance. Like &#34;It\&#39;s a Wonderful life,&#34; this movie is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.&#39;,
   &#34;A great film this, and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is a simple one but works very effectively, the blurring between child-like fantasy and hard-hitting nightmare is very well blurred. The budget looks pretty low, but to the credit of those involved it doesn&#39;t show too often. It also hasn&#39;t dated that much either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago, and it has withstood half-a-dozen viewings. It&#39;s one of those films that won&#39;t appeal to all; though as usual, those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Buerke puts in a good performance as Anna, the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene. Cross is also very good, carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some genuinely (and I don&#39;t say that lightly) disturbing moments in this film, both half-second shockers and more drawn-out tensions. Watch it with the lights out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#34;I love the movie. It brought me back to the best time of my life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need that time again, now more than ever. For me it was a time of freedom, learning, and finding myself. I will always miss it. There will never be another time like the 60&#39;s, unfortunately.&#34;,
   &#34;As a person who sought out an existence as a &#39;professional&#39; person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic. My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also keep healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within that background, I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of Director/Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually could not separate the art of Goldsworthy with camera path of Riedelsheimer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.&#34;,
   &#39;Buster Keaton was finding his feature length voice in &#34;Three Ages.&#34; There are some fine sequences, but it doesn\&#39;t quite hang together. The &#34;chariot race&#34; in &#34;Three Ages&#34; is hilarious. Included are 2 shorts, one of which, &#34;The Goat,&#34; is excellent.&#39;,
   &#39;I saw this film (it\&#39;s English title is &#34;Who\&#39;s Singing Over There?&#34;) at the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival. It won raves then... and disappeared. A terrible shame. It is brilliant. Sublime, ridiculous, sad, and extremely funny. The script is a work of art. It\&#39;s been 19 years and I\&#39;ve seen only a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for that matter) that can match its originality.&#39;,
   &#34;Now this show looks like most of the other shows of it&#39;s type from the mid-90&#39;s, but the only thing is about this one is that it&#39;s different, they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too. I personally thought it was a good show, I can&#39;t understand why would they cancel it. The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hopes is that the WB bring back the show or even do a movie, which I know is gonna be impossible to do, but hey it doesn&#39;t hurt to dream, doesn&#39;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I would recommend if you hadn&#39;t seen it to find the DVD of all 13 episodes, because the characters are great, the story lines are good, the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great.&#34;,
   &#39;Having enjoyed Joyce\&#39;s complex novel so keenly I was prepared to be disappointed by Joseph Strick\&#39;s and Fred Haines\&#39;s screenplay, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone, naturalism, and levity of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film. I imagine the latter would seem disjointed, with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together, without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s amazing to see how &#34;filthy&#34; the film is, given that it was shot in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film censors only, finally, unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in Ireland as late as 2000 (it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club, the Irish Film Theatre, in the late 1970s). Joyce\&#39;s eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy, it offers many wildly &#34;perverse&#34; episodes. Never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the Irish acting profession of the 1960s, respected players all, daring to utter and enact Joyce\&#39;s hugely transgressive text with such gusto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo!&#39;,
   &#34;My discovery of the cinema of Jan Svankmajer opened My eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation, of which Jirí Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the finest, most technically-impressive animated movies I&#39;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A potter wakes up and waters his plant. Then he goes about making a pot. But in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself. He casts the hand out, but soon it returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he&#39;s forced to sculpt a stone hand. He sets about it, fainting from exhaustion, but eventually completes the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a marvellous sequence of metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings, which keep him in thrall, and he escapes back home. He shuts himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie doesn&#39;t hide the fact it&#39;s pure animation, unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic (why?). The hand, for instance, is clearly someone&#39;s hand in a glove. Everything else is clay. Strings are visible and are part of the narrative, making it a precursor of the movie Strings. The atmosphere is eerie: that hand going after the little potter managed to instill more dread in me than many horror movies combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity. it&#39;s a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny which can&#39;t help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right.&#34;,
   &#39;If you\&#39;re one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as \&#39;Book of the Dead\&#39;, \&#39;Book of Eibon\&#39; or \&#39;Necronomicon\&#39;, then you should feel right at home with Malefique, a film which also features an occult tome, one with the power to change the destinies of all involved. Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell, the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers, a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished. Finders of the book are Carrère (Gérald Laroche) a company embezzler shopped by his wife, Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan, the halfwit Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud) who once ate his baby sister, and the \&#39;librarian\&#39; Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), supposedly driven mad by reading, who murdered his wife. Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf\&#39;s equally bizarre, bosomy male in Fight Club (1999), Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet, one who is especially protective of the infantile Pâquerette. With the coming of the book however, and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents, Marcus assumes greater and greater significance. At first assured of an early bail, meanwhile Carrère takes little more than academic interest in events. Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and, as the prisoners experiment, Danvers\&#39; book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staged for the most part within a prison cell, and between four or five characters, Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter (as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers). Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell, a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed, closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere. More than anything, this is a film about being trapped, either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding. &#34;I\&#39;m going to escape,&#34; says Carrère at the start of the film, wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son. Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price, and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an \&#39;escape\&#39; may not be one a man might imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette\&#39;s credit that his film succeeds as well as it does. As critics have noticed, it is a film with strong Freudian overtones - Lassalle\&#39;s distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus; Danvers\&#39; original placenta fetish; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which \&#39;delivery\&#39; is awaited, etc. With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong, and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what, when one comes down to it, is just a matter of four guys, four bunks, one folding table and a book. There\&#39;s a genuine, growing, Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages, while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina, or what ultimately happens to Pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable. The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate, rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions: a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore. Perhaps this is a particularly European manner, as one recalls a similar, measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven\&#39;s The Fourth Man (1983) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lensed well in 1.85:1, Malefique benefits from excellent performances and, if for this viewer at least, the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been, the journey to the final shot was worth taking. Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received Haute Tension (aka: Switchblade Romance, 2003), this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry, this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia&#39;,
   &#34;Well let me just say something about these actors, they really were a good decision, and from experience, having actors really brings the dialogue to life. If you walk into this even fifteen minutes late, you&#39;ll be in for a shock, the movie will have already began. You don&#39;t want to miss the first few jokes, assuming you came to not miss any jokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! I have never seen a movie that ended with such a final ending. Not to be harsh, I mean I loved it, but it just surprised me that it really kept going until it stopped! But i&#39;m getting ahead of myself, lets start with the very start of it, when it began. The plot outline goes like this, there is this man, and not to give away any spoilers, (*Spoiler Alert!!*) (he hasn&#39;t had any sex ever(!) they use this plot device to set the story moving, and there are (intentionally or not, it could go either way) some funny situations had by the main characters, some containing irony, and jokes, and awkward situations, you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director uses the advancements in technology by combining the film shot on the set and scripted dialog, some music, and jokes to make a funny movie, designed as a comedy, where he takes us on a journey from the opening credits to the end with an entirely full movie in between. I went into this movie expecting to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew about it, and left feeling as though i had just left a theater that just played a funny comedy. TEN STARS!!!&#34;,
   &#39;What do I say about such an absolutely beautiful film? I saw this at the Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon considering that this is my main town. I am very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy action type films. I happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when I noticed this film playing in the morning. This is not a sci-fi nor action film of any sort. Let me just start out by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade nor of Eric Etebari, having watched a few episodes(his performance in that seemed stale and robotic). But he managed to really win me over in this performance. I mean really win me over. Having seen Cellular, I did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply amazing. He was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon. But there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me. I later looked it up online and found that Eric won the Best Actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect. Now I keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very nicely done but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more his goal(Seeing films like Godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off). I could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never an easy one. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse. This is one film that I think about constantly and would highly recommend.&#39;,
   &#39;Overall the film is OK. I think it\&#39;s better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in term of its story, its sentimental value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few scenes that makes me touched. Yes I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his acting very good. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the song \&#39;Ne Me Quitte Pas\&#39; by Nina Simone really &#34;\&#39;menaikkan\&#39; my \&#39;bulu\&#39; \&#39;roma\&#39; &#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the song. Both the song. &#34;Ne Me Quitte Pas&#34; and &#34;Hujan&#34;. I just downloaded the song. Beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And salute to Yasmin. The movie\&#39;s ending credit makes me touched again. We can see how Yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the movie deserves that Grand Prix Of International Jury at Berlin Film Festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give 8.5 out of 1o stars.&#39;,
   &#34;&#39;Deliverance&#39; is a brilliant condensed epic of a group of thoroughly modern men who embark on a canoe trip to briefly commune with nature, and instead have to fight for their sanity, their lives, and perhaps even their souls. The film has aged well. Despite being made in the early Seventies, it certainly doesn&#39;t look particularly dated. It still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post-&#39;Death of the Sixties&#39; philosophical-and-cultural shock vehicle. There are very few films with similar conceits that can compare favourably to it, although the legendary Sam Peckinpah&#39;s stuff would have to be up there. Yes, there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film&#39;s most confronting scene (which I won&#39;t expand upon here) - and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium - but what surprises about this film is how achingly beautiful it is at times. This seems to be generally overlooked (yet in retrospect quite understandably so). The cinematography that captures the essence of the vanishing, fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning, and it counterbalances the film as, in a moment of brief madness, we the viewers - along with the characters themselves - are plunged into unrelenting nightmare. &#39;Deliverance&#39;s narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy, and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment, through to crisis, and aftermath. It all takes place very quickly, which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film. The setting is established effectively through the opening credits. The characters are all well-drawn despite limited time spent on back story. We know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are, like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell. The conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere, with a frightening lack of logic. This is author James Dickey&#39;s theme - that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of Man&#39;s perceived inherent &#39;goodness&#39; can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore. There are no demons or bogeymen here. The predatory hillbillies - as the film&#39;s central villains - are merely crude, terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists. They shock because their evil is petty and tangible. The film has no peripheral characters. All reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised Homo Sapiens in the latter 20th century, and all are very real and recognisable. Burt Reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung-ho and almost fatally over-confident Survivalist, Lewis, and it is a shame to think that he really couldn&#39;t recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up-and-down career (&#39;Boogie Nights&#39; excluded, perhaps). Trust me, if your are not a Reynolds fan, you WILL be impressed with his performance here. John Voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self, and Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox both make significant contributions. This is simply a great quartet of actors. To conclude, I must speculate as to if and when &#39;Deliverance&#39; author James Dickey&#39;s &#39;To the White Sea&#39; will be made. For those that enjoyed (?) this film, TTWS is a similarly harrowing tale of an American Air Force pilot&#39;s struggle for survival after being shot down over the Japanese mainland during WW2. It&#39;s more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is Dickey&#39;s trademark, but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular, poetic cinematic experience. There was the suggestion a few years ago that the Coen brothers might be producing it, but that eventually came to nothing. Being an avid Coen-o-phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on TTWS, rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts. Returning to &#39;Deliverance&#39;, it&#39;s impossible to imagine a movie of such honest, unnerving brutality being made in these times, and that is pretty shameful. We, the cinema-going public, are all the poorer for this.&#34;,
   &#39;I had never read Shakespeare\&#39;s Hamlet before watching it but I did have a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it. My view on the movie may be partially biased since I had never read the play before, but I got pulled into this movie\&#39;s grasp. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the story of Hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now on to the movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that all the actors in the movie had a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus, were able to articulate it quite well. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. The thing I liked about this was that it worked very well as a &#34;MOVIE&#34; and not as a play you are studying. You don\&#39;t need to be affluent with Shakespeare to relate to all the Misery hamlet has to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\&#39;s my two cents.&#39;,
   &#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What can I say? This is one of the most perfect films ever made. Its a throwback to the glitxy,sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s..but with a modern touch.The screenplay bursts with wit,charm,humor and tenderness,the cinematograpy is breathtaking(NYC never looked so beautiful),and of course there is the cast! Dudley Moore turns in the performance of his career as Loveable,drunken Arthur Bach. He is also wistful and real..one of the film\&#39;s best lines is his poignant &#34;Not Everyone who drinks is a poet...some of us drink because we\&#39;re not poets.&#34; The great Sir John Gielgud won a much deserved Oscar for his splendid performance as Hobson,Arthur\&#39;s valet and caretaker.Although He considered it a &#34;take the money and run role&#34;,He brings to the character all the talent ,experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian. The supporting cast is also out of thisworld,from Geraldine Fitzgerald\&#39;s sassy Grandma Bach to Stephen Elliott\&#39;s bombastic Mafioso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.The only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned.&#39;,
   &#34;I try to watch it everyday most of the time, and even though I have watched it for the past 4 years, I have not seen every episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Show is about Danny Tanner who is guy who does news for sports. His wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks Jesse, an Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair. Joey, an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls, Donna Joe, they call her D.J., Stephinie who is the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all live under one roof with no one to help them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in the show, Jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins, Nicki and Alex. (this starts to happen in the new seasons) This show is awesome, if you like The Suite life of Zack and Cody, That&#39;s so Raven, Boy Meets world, and Designing Woman, you will love this. (It starts to get better in the ending seasons) Watch it, you will love it!&#34;,
   &#39;I was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly. Some people were looking for a plot??? OK, when this video came out over a decade ago, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It\&#39;s not a movie. It doesn\&#39;t have a plot, nor a central storyline. It\&#39;s a rather artistic anthology of mostly long-form videos, all of them rather smartly or creatively done. Michael Jackson may be considered a freak these days, but, after all, this was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff, incorporating claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self-parody (the &#34;Badder&#34; sequence). And for those wondering what Joe Pesci was doing there, this video came out just a tad before he became a household name, and was one of his most memorable appearances on film. And, IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats anything else Michael Jackson did up to that point!&#39;,
   &#34;&#39;Umi wa miteita&#39; (&#39;The Sea is Watching&#39;) was Akira Kurasawa&#39;s swansong to film: his adaptation of his favored novelist Shugoro Yamamoto&#39;s story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career. Director Kei Kumai pays homage to both Kurosawa and Yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in 19th century Japan, the story explores the lives of the women of a Geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men. The house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers. Each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha. Oshin (Nagiko Tono) supports her family who live in a neighboring village, Kikuno (Misa Shimizu) has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste. Oshin befriends an endangered samurai, falls in love with the gentle fellow, only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with Oshin to marry his promised betrothed. Oshin&#39;s heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically/monetarily by Kikuno and the other geishas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A handsome samurai Ryosuke (Masatoshi Nagase) enters Oshin&#39;s life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her. Kikuno is beset by problems, deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her, and coping with a rich but abusive customer. All the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street, Oshin and Kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by Ryosuke. The manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice, love, and devotion. The sea is watching and will find protection for true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photography by Kazuo Okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful: night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent. The acting is a bit strained for Edo art, but the characters are well created and keep the story credible. The one distraction which is definitely NOT something Kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky Western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real Japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track. But in the end there is enough of Kurosawa&#39;s influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema. Grady Harp&#34;,
   &#34;I found this movie to be very funny, I loved how it made of the politics of modern day sports. This movie is not as funny as South Park but it is pretty funny. And since I am a sports fan I loved how they made fun some of the more ridiculous things in sports. This movie is great for non sports lovers too, probably better for them actually since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many insane rules and intricacies to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. I also found the actual game they came up with to be interesting, it is sort of like horse with bases and psyche outs (for the person shooting). Overall I highly recommend you see this movie, and believe that you will end up loving this movie. However if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably won&#39;t like it. (but that is with any comedy movie)&#34;,
   &#34;I really enjoyed this movie. The humor was a bit absent at times but I enjoyed how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film. This is the only the second movie where I saw Verdone acting (the other was &#39;Un sacco bello&#39;), and I can see why Italians find him tiresome, but he think he played his role well as the loving father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one drawback with this movie was that I knew it took place in Italy - somewhere in the center or south, I presume, but I felt like there was no representation of a place. This movie could have taken place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli...I always think it is important for movies to have a place to give the viewers something to relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian films, then I think that you will enjoy this. It&#39;s not a Fellini or a Rossellini - it&#39;s not realism or neo-realism. It&#39;s a comical story with serious moments that could really happen to any of us.&#34;,
   &#34;Cult classics are nearly impossible to predict. Who could guess that Vision Quest, Fight Club, and 2001: A Space Oddysey, movies that were panned by critics and audiences alike upon their release, would become immensely popular? Like many IMDBers, I consider myself a movie expert. Unlike the majority of those who hated Envy(evidenced by a dismal 4.4 rating), I found Envy to be one of the funniest movies in the last decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of the movie is ridiculous. The dialogue isn&#39;t clever, the scenes have little continuity, and the script seems like it was written by a fourth grader. But that&#39;s exactly why the movie is so hilarious. You see, in order to appreciate the accidental genius of Envy, you have to enjoy the movie from an ironically-detached point of view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I love Envy? Because the movie is bad to the point that it becomes good. This is the recipe for a cult classic, and Envy definitely fits the bill.&#34;,
   &#39;A great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock-imitation (many called it a &#34;ripoff&#34;) with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-TV tapes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it\&#39;s apparent who the killer is, it\&#39;s still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women.&#39;,
   &#39;Criticism of the film EVENING, based on the novel by Susan Minot and adapted for the screen by Minot and Michael Cunningham, has been harsh, so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try. The primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman\&#39;s fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth, that famous actors were given very minor roles, that the entire production was over-hyped, etc. For this viewer, seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home, a very different reaction occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man\&#39;s name - \&#39;Harris\&#39; - with her two grown daughters Nina (Toni Colette) and Constance (Natasha Richardson). As her daughters sit at her bedside Ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend Lila (Mamie Gummer) - a marriage both Ann (Claire Danes as the youthful Ann) and Lila\&#39;s alcoholic brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) objected to, feeling that Lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), her housekeeper\&#39;s son who had become a physician. Harris, Buddy, Lila, and Ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now, 50 years later, as Ann is dying. The older Lila (Meryl Streep) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed: \&#39;there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on.\&#39; The film is a delicate mood piece and the script by Minot and Cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons. Yes, there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation, but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady\&#39;s words, such \&#39;holes\&#39; are understandable. The film is graced by the presence of not only Redgrave, Richardson (Redgrave\&#39;s true daughter), Collette, Gummer (Streep\&#39;s true daughter), Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Eileen Atkins, Glenn Close, Hugh Dancy and Patrick Wilson, but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances. The setting is gorgeous (cinematography by Gyula Pados) and the musical score is by the inimitable Jan A.P. Kaczmarek. Lajos Koltai (&#34;Being Julia\&#39;) directs. Judge this film on your own....

   &#34;My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (ret. Major, US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese, and also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my father was the technical adviser of this film and I am hoping that he had an impact on the film in making it resemble how it really was back then, as I read in various comments written by the viewers of this film that it seemed like real-life. My father is a fanatic of facts and figures, and always wanted things to be seen as they were so I would like to believe he had something to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, married to my mother for over 40 years (ironically, she&#39;s Japanese), and a few years ago was awarded one of the highest commendations from the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and activities of bringing back Kendo and Iaido to Japan since McArthur banned them after WWII.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father was once a marine but I know that once you are a marine, you&#39;re always a marine. And that is exactly what he is and I love and respect him very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to be able to watch this film if anyone will have a copy of it. And I&#39;d love to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!&#34;,
   &#39;I thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for TV movie, and it contained both a lot of action and humor. I found the entertainment value worth watching, and would watch it again or a similar show again. I\&#39;m disappointed that Sean was not credited here on IMDb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with Sean once again playing for even higher &#34;cash&#34; stakes, since his life would be on the line again anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that Sean played the role very well, and reminds me of an actor by the name of Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux on Days of Our Lives - the Soap Opera.&#39;,
   &#39;Those who love the book Jane Eyre as I do (it\&#39;s my all time favorite, and I re read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dalton is just a tad too good looking to be Mr. Rochester, but other than that, he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I don\&#39;t think about the ages of the characters. The dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book, which was very smart. Sure, this film might seem a little long, but it\&#39;s the only version I\&#39;ve seen that includes part 3 of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer Zeferelli version, as it would have helped that mess of a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell plays &#34;Aunt Reed&#34;! She is so versatile that I didn\&#39;t recognize her. She plays Daisy in Keeping up Appearances, and also played Mrs. Musgrove in 1995\&#39;s Persuasion (another wonderful adaption).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Got the DVD this week, and it\&#39;s marvelous to see the original unedited version. There\&#39;s lots more at the beginning (Young Jane at Gateshead and at Lowood.) And at the end, they\&#39;ve restored lots of things, (I always wondered why St. John had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who Jane is-- because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the US VHS version!). Rosamund Oliver is in it...she was completely cut out of the VHS. As far as I could tell, they hadn\&#39;t edited out any of Timothy Dalton\&#39;s parts, so nothing new there, but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the VHS. Thanks, BBC (PS...I would have paid more for a special edition DVD...with maybe some interviews with the stars...or a making of show)&#39;,
   &#34;Really...and incredible film that though isn&#39;t very popular...extremely touching and almost life altering...was for me at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth seeing and buying .....Added to my favorite movie list....it&#39;s number one now....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very touching movie that all people should see..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man in the Moon.....we&#39;ll it&#39;s just incredible. It&#39;s now my favorite movie and I only saw it today and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you&#39;re somewhat mature......If you don&#39;t really try to feel the characters emotions then you&#39;ll never get the true meaning and value of this movie....But it really is incredible....just watch it because it&#39;ll alter the way some people look at life....worth seeing 5/5&#34;,
   &#39;While there aren\&#39;t any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, and Walt &amp; Roy did in their eras with the studio. If you thought think &#34;The Castaways&#34; or &#34;The Island At The Top Of The World&#34; weren\&#39;t identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than Atlantis, then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin\&#39; cartoon.&#39;,
   &#34;This film is moving without being sentimental - meaningful without being pretentious. It tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart as the encroachments of technology and an advancing society make the family-run business increasingly untenable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is wonderful - though none of us in the west are likely to have heard of these actors, we should have long ago - they play their characters with honesty and reverence - these are flawed characters, each with major weaknesses, but with such utter humanity and kindness that it&#39;s impossible not to become engaged in the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need more films like this - we need more western filmmakers creating films such as this.&#34;,
   &#39;If you love cult 70\&#39;s Sci-fi the way I do, or if you like movies such as &#34;Repo Man&#34; or &#34;Buckaroo Bonzai&#34; than you\&#39;re going to love this one. It\&#39;s a stream of consciousness 70\&#39;s Sci-fi spectacular, including a 22nd century junkyard and the Earth a million years from now. This movie is pure 70\&#39;s. Put on Steve Miller\&#39;s &#34;Fly Like An Eagle&#34; or Pink Floyd\&#39;s &#34;Dark Side Of The Moon&#34; and you\&#39;re ready to go!&#39;,
   &#34;In 1943, a group of RAF Officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decide to escape from a POW camp using a Gymnastic Vaulting Horse in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to film his account, and it kick-started a peculiar British Film Genre- the Military Prison Camp story that reached its apogee in Danger Within (1959).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest films I have ever watched. There are no great dramatic moments, but a steady storyline eventually builds to a climax that has more tension because the story doesn&#39;t give way for unlikely drama, jump cuts or jacked up (somethings about to happen!) music. It is utterly of its time and works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead a curiously low key cast of extras and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet. They keep emotion out of their roles. As so many were, until recently, ex-service, I suspect they recreated their war time roles as &#39;Officers and Gentlemen&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most Wartime Escape Films, the story doesn&#39;t end at the barbed wire: and that fact alone keeps me glued to the end.&#34;,
   &#39;Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who go on a spontaneous trip to Thailand and wind up in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage. In this way, the movie had the potential to turn into a serious and moving film, such as &#34;Return to Paradise&#34;, but instead, the movie chose to focus little on the girls\&#39; situation and more on their friendship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both turn in excellent performances, and the movie is much more about the interplay between them - the suspicion, the jealousy, the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices made in the name of friendship. This movie chooses not to delve too deeply into politics or even into the harshness of prison life (which is a bit glossed over), and focuses more on these friendship issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some plot holes here, and some parts that just didn\&#39;t seem believable or realistic. We didn\&#39;t feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation as well as we might have. And we get very little feeling of life outside the prison walls, with Bill Pullman playing the supposedly sleazy lawyer who actually turns out to have a heart of gold. In short, this should, by all rights, have been a much darker movie than it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I enjoyed it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting. Worth seeing.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;The Color Purple&#34;, is truly amazing. There is none like it, and I don\&#39;t think there ever will be. It\&#39;s a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on. The actors are flawless and the directing is superb. I absolutely loved it. A movie has never made me so happy. It is beautiful, that\&#39;s the best way to explain it.&#39;,
   &#34;These are one of the movies that don&#39;t require any brain or thinking, it&#39;s a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so. I was really surprised with John Abraham&#39;s acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless face,so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully,by managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also quite surprised with the Akshaye&#39;s 3 girls because there roles don&#39;t require much talent but mostly moaning about Akshaye&#39;s dissapearence(to the other girls) i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing ,also majority of songs are good,it is colourful and fun so on a boring Sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood.&#34;,
   &#39;Like his earlier film, &#34;In a Glass Cage&#34;, Agustí Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see. The heightened drama, intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical, yet never steps into it. In that way, it pulls off an almost impossible feat: to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet so understated, and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye. Unabashed, gorgeous, and highly tense... this film is simply superb!&#39;,
   &#39;I gotta be straight-up - I haven\&#39;t seen a film as solid as DOG BITE DOG in quite a while. I\&#39;m a big fan of the &#34;old-school&#34; late 80s to mid 90s era CATIII films, and I had been hearing that that &#34;style&#34; of films is making a bit of a come-back with films such as this, and Herman Yau\&#39;s GONG TAU (which as of this writing I have not yet seen...), so I was very interested to give some of these newer-wave CATIII films a shot. Did this film live up to my expectations? Absolutely - but not quite in the fashion that I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story follows a young, animalistic, resourceful and virtually unstoppable Thai hit-man with a somewhat vague history who comes to Hong Kong to complete a &#34;mission&#34;. Due to some bad-luck, he is quickly identified by a roguish copy (who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit-man), and is quickly apprehended and captured. This state of affairs doesn\&#39;t last long though, as the un-named assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly. The hunt is on, and a cat-and-mouse game between the police and the &#34;mad dog&#34; (as the police refer to him) ensues. Along the way, Mad Dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow-witted young woman, and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation. The ante keeps getting upped as Mad Dog\&#39;s only objective is to get out of Hong Kong and back to Thailand by any means necessary, and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film, but I don\&#39;t want to give too much away. I watched DOG BITE DOG knowing nothing about the premise, and I think it\&#39;s the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way. As to comparisons to the older-style CATIII films...there are some similarities. DOG BITE DOG has some hyper-violent moments reminiscent of the &#34;good ol\&#39; days&#34;, but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old-school classicks like THE UNTOLD STORY or RED TO KILL. Where many of the older CATIII films\&#39; main intention was to &#34;shock&#34; - DOG BITE DOG is a far more thought-out and well-rounded production (though that\&#39;s not to take ANYTHING away from those CATIII films that I hold so dear...). This film is far more &#34;emotional&#34; than it is exploitative, and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds, the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides. There really are no clear-cut &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; guys, as Mad Dog shows moments of extreme compassion, and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer. There\&#39;s also no nudity/sex in this film, which is a typical characteristic of the older CATIII films. Personally, I would compare DOG BITE DOG more to Park\&#39;s SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE or perhaps the Pang brother\&#39;s BANGKOK DANGEROUS, as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence. Again - there\&#39;s pretty much nothing that I didn\&#39;t like about this film. The acting is dead-on, the cinematography is sharp and well done, and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isn\&#39;t seen very often. Is this film (and others like it...) the &#34;rebirth&#34; of the CATIII film - not exactly - but it IS a very solid film that\&#39;s absolutely worth checking out...9/10&#39;,
   &#39;The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says - &#34;Is the piston firing short?&#34; (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie. Very lovable and very intelligent too. Her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours. The hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well. It\&#39;s awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival. It loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the US Govt. I don\&#39;t see why it doesn\&#39;t figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. Great Movie, it has the presidential seal of approval on it!&#39;,
   &#34;I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I can&#39;t believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson&#39;s flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didn&#39;t care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should have lasted longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America.&#34;,
   &#34;This was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues. It dealt with issues of rascism and class. But, it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself. This movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny. It also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it. The actors I think were able to convey each character wonderfully. I just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was. At a just glancing look you wouldn&#39;t see how deep the movie is, but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie.&#34;,
   &#34;Cross-eyed is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way. This film is smart, concise, and consistently entertaining and funny. As a writer/director, Jones exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable. The story is definitely something you haven&#39;t seen before which is good. It&#39;s unique and fun, and manages to work in visually fantastic elements as well as the long lost slapstick genre together to form a hearty comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very promising first film.&#34;,
   &#39;This is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a Canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man. It begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things, parts of high-tech equipment presumably; it isn\&#39;t really made very clear. The emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they\&#39;re herded around outside in little yellow jackets. The film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory, and talking with his crew as he does so. This is a world of relentless industrialization. It\&#39;s a relief at least to know these soulless images aren\&#39;t going to be presented without a human voice, as is the case in Nikolaus Geyrhalter\&#39;s gleefully cold documentary about the food industry, \&#39;Our Daily Bread.\&#39; \&#39;Manufactured Landscapes\&#39; contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town (many towns, really) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever, with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is. Some of these scenes, the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places, might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer Sebastião Salgado. But this photographer isn\&#39;t as interested in seeing people up close. His orientation places him somewhere in between Salgado and the cold, neutral modern landscape photographs of Lewis Baltz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this happens in China, of course, though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in Bangladesh. It is backed up by music in a New Age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive. There are a good many stills of the photographer\&#39;s work--or were some of them made by the film crew? It isn\&#39;t made clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward Burtynsky is the name of the photographer. We see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow. The irony is that Burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted, and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring. He admits himself that he takes no political stand. When we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film\&#39;s cinematographer Peter Mettler, Burtynsky\&#39;s work almost amounts to a kind of glorification, and hence falsification. But he is showing us places that, if we look closely, reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logically, but not entirely fortunately, it is Burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites. Burtynsky\&#39;s &#34;epiphanies&#34; may have inspired his decades of fine work, but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we\&#39;re changing the planet irreparably; are dependent on oil, which will run out; that China has come into the game of massive industrialization late, and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel. The interest of \&#39;Manufactured Landscapes\&#39; would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it. The reasons for watching it are two: to see glimpses of Burtynsky\&#39;s work and the raw materials, the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully; and to observe scenes from the vast, awesome, daunting, and rather horrifying industrialization of modern China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the limitations of the narration, the idea of the title \&#39;Manufactured Landscapes\&#39; feels insufficiently developed. It even seems a misnomer. New landscapes they are, but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than &#34;manufactured.&#34; \&#39;Landscapes of Waste\&#39; or \&#39;Wasted Landscapes\&#39; might be better titles. There is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject; and those who want to know more about Edward Burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions.&#39;,
   &#34;I first saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back in the day, after hearing Stephen King praise it to high heaven. Not really a fan of either star, I still wanted to see it because I&#39;m a huge thriller fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed. The acting was superb, especially from the two young boys. Usually I loathe child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too. It was beautifully shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One must also note the plot twists. The three twists at the end hit hard and fast, and I didn&#39;t see them coming. The final twist of the film, coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, even though I&#39;ve re-watched the film so many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true gem.&#34;,
   &#34;I just saw this movie tonight, opening night. It was great!! I&#39;m a big fan of sports movies, and this was right up there as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was great. (Oh, by the way, Mr. Quaid, if you read this...my sister lives in Austin, where you live.....and she was supposed to buy you a drink once...well...she kinda stood you up...but she didn&#39;t mean to! :C) [not that anyone&#39;s going to believe that...]) ANYWAY, it&#39;s a great movie. Everyone who likes a good sports movie, should go out and see it! :C)&#34;,
   &#39;It is quite a simple not very active but very charming film. There were moments where I can see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn\&#39;t win for Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her he\&#39;ll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible. Only problem is, when she finds Johnny\&#39;s one-handless brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (&#34;Snap out of it!&#34;), it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!&#39;,
   &#34;I felt this film - throughout. I waas impressed with Russell Crowe&#39;s talent in developing his relationship with Lillie, such a typical Aussie blend of softly softly approach, a bit self depreciating and very persistent. Really loved the cinematography and direction. Pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh, didn&#39;t Russell&#39;s talent even in 1993 shine! .. and I have yet to see Gladiator.&#34;,
   &#34;I really thought that this movie was superb. Not only is the history correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt&#39;s portrayal of Victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth. Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of Albert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well. I appreciated the beautiful score, which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story. I also considered the cinematography to be outstanding, some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009&#39;s best!&#34;,
   &#39;I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very personable, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife. Delightful ensemble cast. Lots of talent, clever script, lots going on and beautiful locations. Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day. Especially in the winter when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizon.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;The Thief of Bagdad&#34; is impressive in the shape of the evil magician Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). He plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young King Ahmad, and a gorgeous princess from her father...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He falls victim in the end, as all tyrants do (in books and legends) to love and of the common man whom he ignored, here embodied by the little thief (Sabu).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script is poetic, simply and very beautiful... The costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds, attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The radiant hero wears white turbans and robes, and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before, while through its use of color, it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With flying carpet and flying white horse, with a giant genie (excellently played by Rex Ingram), with evil wizards, and with the good acting of Sabu and Veidt, &#34;The Thief of Bagdad&#34; captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian Nights... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1940 version remains the screen\&#39;s finest fairy tale!&#39;,
   &#39;David Lynch usually makes films that resemble puzzles put together the wrong way. They are interesting to look at and think about but they really don\&#39;t gel in your mind. Perhaps art will always mean the most to its creator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch film. Not that there\&#39;s anything typical about them anyway. It\&#39;s an odyssey through rural America. A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house. He rode 300 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin to make amends to his sick brother for past offenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the heart of this film is sweet voiced Richard Farnsworth. He brings Alvin Straight right to us in a simple and honest way. The fact that the film is slow paced matches Alvin\&#39;s slow journey toward realization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way Alvin meets a confused and frightened young girl. She is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation. After listening to Alvin speak about family she reconsiders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later Alvin witnesses a distraught woman kill a deer with her car. She complains that she has killed several and leaves. Alvin feels bad but is smart enough to cook up some dear meat that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later Alvin\&#39;s lawn mower loses its brakes and nearly kills him. A nice man and his wife let him stay in their yard while he gets it fixed. They even let him call his sweet but slow daughter, nicely played by Sissy Spacek, whose haunted by a terrible tragedy in her own past. Alvin insists on paying for the call. The man even offers to drive Alvin to his brothers with pleasure. Alvin declines with thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Alvin waits he also goes off to a bar with a kindly old man as they discuss the harshness of war and the price it took on their souls. Alvin even confesses a fatal mistake he made as a sniper that has forever haunted him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alvin also encounters two bickering brothers who\&#39;ve repaired his lawn mower. He talks them down in price wisely calling them on their high labor and repair costs. He even helps them to appreciate one another learning from his own mistakes with his brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night before Alvin leaves the man\&#39;s yard he takes his hat off to him. The man tells him it was an honor having him stay and asks Alvin to write to him. This scene is perfect in it\&#39;s simplicity. It\&#39;s heartfelt because it\&#39;s so straight, so real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The journey continues and we can\&#39;t help to get more and more involved with it. We want Alvin to get to his brothers. We want him to make amends. We want to know this world is full of forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was Richard Farnsworth at his best. It was his last film and his performance was amazing. You can\&#39;t help but to understand his pride, to listen to his wisdom, and to ultimately feel his pain. One becomes as taken with him as the man who offers him his back yard to stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there\&#39;s justice in the afterlife then Alvin Straight, his brother, and Richard Farnsworth are together sitting at a bar. I can picture them discussing their lives, regrets, hopes, and joys. As Alvin says in the film, &#34;My brother and I used to look up at the stars.&#34; Well, I know they all are with the best view in the house.&#39;,
   &#34;For fans of 1970s Hammer type horror films, this movie should be a treat. The only thing I didn&#39;t like about the film was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode. In general, however, this is a solid, spooky little movie. If this is not Amicus&#39; best film, it&#39;s certainly one of them. The best episode, rightfully saved for last, is the one featuring Jon Pertwee as a horror film actor--it is really excellent. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it&#39;s hard to believe he didn&#39;t do more of these types of movies. All in all, this is an entertaining movie, which scared the heck out of me as a child, and which still gives me the creeps to this day.&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I am 26 years old, and my friend has it on DVD!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got a case of brew, and watched this classic! It lost NONE of it\&#39;s original kung fu coolness! If you are a fan of kung fu/karate movies, this is a must see... the DVD is available. I believe this movie is also called &#34;Pick Your Poison&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it soon!&#39;,
   &#39;I happened on &#34;Shower&#34; in the foreign film section of my local video store and passed it over several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy. I then lucked into a copy to purchase at economical price and am happy for my luck. &#34;Shower&#34; is the story of three(3) men, a father and two(2) adult sons, each coming to terms with life changes as the world around them also continues to change in modern China. As with many &#34;foreign&#34; films, the Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the fascinating characteristics of the local, Chinese color giving the setting to this story, is the difficult yet touching relationships between the men and a sole woman involved in the story, all set against the backdrop of a village bathhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The family\&#39;s story moves from estrangement to understanding and made me glad I came to know these people. Added to the main story are the numerous small characters, bathhouse customers, and their individual conflicts and friendships. &#34;Shower&#34; is a film one walks away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity.&#39;,
   &#34;I just found the IMDb and searched this film and I was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as I did when 6 or so years old in 1967?. I saw it before the Jungle Book so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year. I burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the Eagle and always wanted to see the film again. When we got home we had a Roast chicken dinner and I got the wish bone and guess who I wished to be? My dad then said &#39;I bet you wished to be an Eagle&#39; and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away...&#34;,
   &#39;This movie was so great! I am a teenager, and I and my friends all love the series, so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds. I recommend it to everyone. My favorite line in this movie is when Logan Bartholomew says: &#34;rosy cheeks&#34;, when he is talking about his baby daughter. He is such a great actor, as well as Erin Cottrell. They pair up so well, and have such a great chemistry! I really hope that they can work again together. They are such attractive people, and are very good actors. I have finally found movies that are good to watch. Lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good, and show good morals, and Christian values. But at the same time, these movies aren\&#39;t cheesy.&#39;,
   &#39;Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can\&#39;t see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. Her more &#34;vocally correct&#34; version of &#34;Stay With Me&#34; never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.&#39;,
   &#39;Cashing in on the &#34;demons-meets-clergy&#34; trend of the late \&#39;60s/early \&#39;70s that most prominently included the triptych of &#34;Rosemary\&#39;s Baby,&#34; &#34;The Exorcist,&#34; and &#34;The Omen,&#34; &#34;The Sentinel&#34; is an addition that\&#39;s just as good (albeit the most overlooked of the lot). In a way, it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of Polanski\&#39;s &#34;The Tenant&#34; (which came out the same year) for good measure. A New York model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss-coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale; she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor (the brilliant Burgess Meredith), plus the other off-center tenants. Kept awake by loud noises above her apartment, she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building. From there, director Michael Winner (&#34;Death Wish&#34;) kicks this supernatural thriller into gear, and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine. Aided by a brilliant ensemble cast, a subtle storyline, and excellent makeup FX by Dick Smith (&#34;The Exorcist&#34;), &#34;The Sentinel&#34; is a genuinely creepy horror flick.&#39;,
   &#34;Okay, I know I shouldn&#39;t like this movie but I do. From Pat Morita&#39;s loveable interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno&#39;s annoying yell, I laughed throughout this movie.As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, it&#39;s a good mvie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is Morita talking to his boss in Tokyo with the drinking a close second.&#34;,
   &#34;This was a pretty decent movie. This movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained. Just a typical Hollywood film. This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and definitely doesn&#39;t deserve one, but I thought it was pretty good. It&#39;s kind of like the show 24 but set into movie format. If you like the whole we&#39;ve got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick. I personally think that storyline has been done WAY too much, but The Sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the Secret Service. All in all, this movie won&#39;t leave your jaw to the floor or change your life, but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good?&#34;,
   &#34;A well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. Pluses: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he&#39;s there. The Music. A disinterested look at the life of policemen. Minuses: The violence and the gore, but I guess they add to the realistic effects. Still, having people&#39;s heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints - 7/10&#34;,
   &#34;It&#39;s rare, nowadays, to find a romantic comedy that isn&#39;t incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie (eg. Big Fat Greek wedding; Me, Myself &amp; Irene). There were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie, nothing unpalatably profane. All around, it was a cute movie with likable characters. I thought the ending was a little abrupt. It feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish. The acting left a little to be desired, but was made up for by the pace of the story. If I&#39;d known it was a Farrelly brothers movie I would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it, but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie. Good for them, I hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films.&#34;,
   &#39;This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all. Generally speaking, I am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories. And this one is GREAT! Besides Meryl\&#39;s performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise, the movie\&#39;s greatest asset is the story it is based on. The riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture, after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye-opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans, and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people (the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example) are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would, for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions. The other face of the so-called &#34;civilized&#34; society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings (needless to say, this is very general, even though this specific tale unfolds in Australia), that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty. Must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought-provoking.&#39;,
   &#34;This is one of Disney&#39;s top five animated features, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film (as opposed to the compilation films of the 40&#39;s), and expensive depth via the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way. Although Disney adapts the story somewhat liberally, you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations---a clear time period the story takes place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multi-dimensional character. Actually, all of the characters are somewhat well-developed, except for the Prince--left the most flat--we know he has a sense of humor, and a great smile, but that&#39;s about all. Like Snow White, Disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture---in most versions of Cinderella, the stepsisters are attractive, just not as pretty as Cinderella, and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favorite Disney additions: the mice! Also, appreciated the continuity--Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child--I remember View Master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it! The broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil Lady Tremaine to give up her hold over Cinderella and admit defeat---Audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all Disney villains, satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.&#34;,
   &#34;This complicated story begins fairly simply, with an English journalist accepting a wager from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted Blackwood castle. Once there, the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors, until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room. He sits at the harpsichord and starts to play the tune he has heard, and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She informs him with an ambiguous charming/eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night...the Night of the Dead. Thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night. SPOILER AHEAD: it probably won&#39;t surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost. This doesn&#39;t prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple. This is a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, the spooky castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence ( though both have been toned down in the version most Americans have seen over the years.) The alluring, captivating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you&#39;ve ever seen in the movies. Recommended!&#34;,
   &#39;I had never heard of Leos Carax until his Merde segment in last years Tokyo, and his was easily the stand-out the film\&#39;s three stories. It wasn\&#39;t my favorite of the shorts, but it was the most unique, and the most iconic. &#34;The Lovers on the Bridge&#34; was the first of his full length features I\&#39;ve seen, a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic. Though he\&#39;s classified as a neo-nouvelle vogue, his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60\&#39;s experimental narratives. His movies are closer to Jean Vigo in &#34;L\&#39;atlante&#34;, Jean Cocteau, and Guy Maddin, than Godard and Truffaut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Boy Meets Girl Carax\&#39;s 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states. He combines the exaggerated worlds of Maddin, but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like Cocteau, but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible, emotional, and engaging like Vigo\&#39;s movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of Boy Meets Girl is simple, and similar to Carax\&#39;s two following films which comprise this &#34;Young lovers&#34; trilogy. A boy named Alex played by Denis Lavant (who plays a character named Alex in Carax\&#39;s next two movies), has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend. In the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder. He walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex, and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate. He steals records for her and leaves them at his friend\&#39;s apartment, but avoids contacting either of them directly. He wanders around and finds his way to a party, where he meets a suicidal young woman, and the film becomes part &#34;Breathless&#34; and part &#34;Limelight&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later he is advised by an old man with sign language to &#34;speak up for yourself...young people today It\&#39;s like they forgot how to talk.&#34; The old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film, and how an actor timid off stage became a confident &#34;lion&#34; when in front of the camera. Heres where the movie tips its hand, but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene, since it overlaps the style of the film (silent and expressionist), with the content (a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to). Though Alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end, he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which aren\&#39;t easy to nail down from moment to moment, aside from a desire to fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a scene in the film where Alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies, all crying in a chorus that fills that room, until he turns on a tape of a children\&#39;s show making them fall silent. Unexpectedly due a glitch the TV ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses. Even as Carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell (the room full of whining infants), he\&#39;s mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses. Even the rich old, bell of the ball has a brother she misses. In another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though indebted to films before talkies, Carax is a master of music, knowing when to pipe in the Dead Kennedy\&#39;s &#34;Holiday in Cambodia&#34;, or an early David Bowie song, the sounds of a man playing piano, or of a girl softly humming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Boy Meets Girl, when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt, when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel, when Alex enters a party an feels out of place, its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance; like the famous author who can\&#39;t speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain, or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut. This film is the missing link between Jean Piere Jenuet, Michel Gondry, and Wes Anderson, whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy, all have a parallel with different visuals, musical, and emotional cues in these Carax movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every line of dialog, every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level, some I lack words to articulate. There are many tales of a boy meeting a girl, but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment. The other movies you want to watch can wait. See this first. If I were to make films, I would want them to be like this, in fact I wish all films were like this, where the ephemeral becomes larger than life, and life itself becomes a dream.&#39;,
   &#39;It is a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again. &#34;The Amati Girls&#34; is such a movie. In old time movie theaters I would have stayed put for more showings. Was this story autobiographical for the writer/director? It has the aura of reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness. Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? I have loved her work since &#34;For Roseanna&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most movies, one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was hard to suspend such belief in &#34;The Amati Girls&#34;. One feels such a part of this family! How I wanted to come to the defense of Dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life. And wanted to cheer Lee Grant as she levels criticism at Cloris Leachman\&#39;s hair color. The humor throughout is not belly laugh humor, but instead has a feel-good quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is no coincidence that the family name, Amati, translated from the Italian means \&#39;the loved ones\&#39;.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a really funny (and sexy) movie - that is not just silly but has great acting. It&#39;s the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston film festival, and I found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else, and also moved by some of the movie&#39;s more serious parts. It&#39;s a unique movie about two doctors, and I don&#39;t want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones - plus the dialogue is great. Wood Harris&#39; character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their roles. If you get a chance to see it - go - you won&#39;t be disappointed. It&#39;s worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves an award.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny. If you think of seeing this one for the shootings.. stay clear. This one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure. Even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do...WHY? Fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with. Yes the language is harsh at times, but it suits the characters well. There are some loose ends left or unanswered, but all movies have these. The major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents. Highly recommended for teens and adults.&#39;,
   &#34;I have to say, I loved Vanishing Point. I&#39;ve seen the original, and this is a pretty good remake of it. Even though it didn&#39;t follow the original storyline (that&#39;s why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the car, well the DJ&#39;s comment at the end about the Challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (And if you look, the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150), but even though I didn&#39;t see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged Hemi, so it&#39;s possible. For those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn&#39;t allow it, the normally aspirated Chrysler 300C of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it&#39;s like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. Plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the Challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic.&#34;,
   &#39;No, this isn\&#39;t a sequel to the fabulous OVA series, but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of Ghim (and the disappearance of Woodchuck). It is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series, which is why characters (namely Orson and Shiris) are reintroduced, and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the OVA. (The booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions, as do various online sites.) The first eight episodes of this 27-part TV series focus on the fateful battle at Demon Dragon Mountain. The remaining 19 episodes introduce us to Spark, a blue-haired knight wannabe who identifies with Parn, and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the Dark Wizard Wagnard from resurrecting Kardis the Destroyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it isn\&#39;t quite the equivalent of the original LODOSS WAR (we all love the finale where Parn saves Deedlit from Wagnard, don\&#39;t we?), this TV follow-up is still great fun for fantasy fans. Even if the animation is limited (and a step down from the artistic streak of the first LODOSS), this 27-part series has its elements of appeal. The fully-realized characters, engaging storyline, magic, romance, and a superb soundtrack scored by Kaoru Wada of NINJA SCROLL, all give this uneven spin-off some punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the OVA dub of LODOSS has been criticized for one reason or another, I generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs. So I had significant hopes for the dub for CHRONICLES, made in 1999-2000. For the most part, the LODOSS TV English track is of passable (if not stellar) quality; it does, however, have its share of problems. Much of the original cast who lent their English voices to the characters of LODOSS return (including Lisa Ortiz as Deedlit!), which is a nice bonus. On the other hand, Billy Regan\&#39;s more mature sounding Parn is a bit offputting. He doesn\&#39;t do a bad job, but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes (causing some anti-dub fans to instantly diss the dub), but by the time Spark and company take the stage, I found it less bothersome. (I don\&#39;t know if it\&#39;s because he improved or if it just grew on me.) Also, not everyone from the OAV dub returns. Jayce Reeves only voices Wagnard (terrifically) for one episode; he\&#39;s replaced by Pete Zarustica for the whole show, who gives a scratchy, but still malevolent turn (as well as the expected evil laughter). Anthony Cruise\&#39;s Kashue, on the other hand, is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride. Oliver Gregory is probably the most effective as Orson, especially during his final dramatic scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from Lisa Ortiz (Deedlit), Karen Smith (Shiris), John Knox (Ashram), and Al Muscari (Slayn), the dub\&#39;s best voices come from some of the newer characters, including Crispin Freeman (Spark, Maar, Garrack -episodes 16-27-), Roxanne Beck (Little Neese), Meg Frances (who voices Pirotess in the OAV but also voices Ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as Karla) and especially Angora Deb (who steals every scene she\&#39;s in as Leaf the Half-Elf). The rest of the cast isn\&#39;t terrible by any means, but a little more uneven than the OAV dub. Some are all right (Aldonova, Greevus) while others are lackluster (Hobb, palace guards, dragons, etc.) and few were awful (in particular, Prince Reona\&#39;s VA is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact the lack of aural continuity (some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes) is one of the problems of the dub. Others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue, uneven synchronization, and finally (I apologize in advance to the fans of this) the LODOSS ISLAND segments. These offbeat, super-deformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty. Admittingly, I at first found them to be a major nuisance, but they sorta grew on me after a while. (Besides, there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as &#34;I\&#39;m King Kashue, and this is my CASHEW! I\&#39;m REALLY quite a nut!&#34;) These flaws rank the dub for CHRONICLES just a notch just below that for the OVA, resulting in an uneven English track summed up best as &#34;OK&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one wonders if the Japanese language track is the preferred listening choice, well, guess what? The Japanese version has its good and bad points, too. While some voices are less annoying than the English language track, I found others to be less appealing than the English equivalents (in particular, the actress who does Deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as Lisa Ortiz OR Yumi Tohma). Plus, I should mention that the Japanese cast is NOT THE SAME AS THE OVA. Because the series was made seven years after the original, all but one (Sho Hayami) of the cast members are replaced by new ones. Although they do a respectably good job, it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the Japanese OVA cast. Shows that not everything in Japanese is better than English, eh? Despite its flaws, CHRONICLES OF THE HEROIC KNIGHT is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground. Its not without its rough spots and doesn\&#39;t always live up to its predecessor, yet there\&#39;s enough good points to counter the bad, making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy Anime.&#39;,
   &#34;I happened upon this film by accident, and really enjoyed. Timothy Busfield&#39;s character is without redeeming qualities, and at one point, Busfield and star Meloni ogle women as they pass by...Meloni&#39;s take on the parade is different from Busfield&#39;s. Janel Maloney is terrific...She looks very much like Tea Leone, but the major difference here is that Janel can actually ACT. Some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when it&#39;s on cable.&#34;,
   &#39;This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen. The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre. This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story. The casts is outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before, ever. The effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. My one complaint, I just wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but other then that I think they did a great job. The dialog, the characters and the story was perfect. The acting was wonderful. This has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. You heard me, the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel. I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Kalifornia&#34; is one of my all-time favourite movies, and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s. The film has a very stylish surface to it, but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. One of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances, Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named Early. Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heart-breaking. &#34;Kalifornia&#34; has a very simple plot to it, that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder, as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. &#34;Kalifonia&#34; is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore.&#39;,
   &#34;As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others however, I like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made.This occurs when Harry&#39;s safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition sexy Jane, thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas! Not to be missed an adventure classic.&#34;,
   &#34;A Bug&#39;s Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90&#39;s. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.&#34;,
   &#39;The main problem of the first &#34;Vampires&#34; movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic. Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una certainly is the coolest vampire since Blade\&#39;s Deacon Frost. Unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn\&#39;t Carpenter use more of this??) this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been. I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence (for example inside a city) and was left somewhat disappointed. While &#34;Los Muertos&#34; proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still drags a little in some parts (though nowhere near as bad as &#34;Vampires&#34; did). Much like &#34;Vampires&#34; however this movie\&#39;s climax near the end is not very intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the above may sound like &#34;Los Muertos&#34; is a bad movie but it definitely isn\&#39;t. It is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre. It is neither an unoriginal Dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like Blade II. It simply could have used a bit more excitement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;d really like to see a third installment made by Carpenter but it\&#39;s probably not going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER WARNING The ending was way too predictable. Una should have gotten away- that would have made the movie quite unusual.&#39;,
   &#34;Rock Star: INXS was the best music TV series I have ever watched! It had some of the greatest rock n&#39; roll songs ever written, performed by 15 very talented singers/performers. It also had (in my opinion) the most heart-felt, feel-good, surprise endings in all of reality TV. It actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner!!! Over the 13 weeks of this televised competition, the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants. After 30-some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality TV show. And the fact that INXS was, and still is, one of the greatest rock n&#39; roll bands EVER just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series. If you don&#39;t have the series recorded, ROCK STAR: INXS the DVD is a great alternative.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Gespenster&#34; Question of to be cool in the German cinema&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are not many German films in the last ten years, who have made me so interest. Yes, the problem of the most German films are in this film &#34;Gespenster&#34; too. He is on some places to uncooked to be good to see. Special the figure of Toni (Sabine Timento) is too cool. But thats is in German films always so. Everybody must to learns this coolneß - is the realism in this films. Thats difficult to understand. But in this case it makes some sense, because she steals and she lies - she is the kind of girl is better you never love it, because you lose it. Thats not clear for the other girl Nina in this film. She love her - and she would lose her. But Nina lost everything. She will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling. There is no way - but you must take it said Herbert Achterbusch for twenty years. Thats so often the way it goes in German films. Why? Nina (Julia Hummer) is not inside of the laws of society - the is outside - and there she have no chance. This films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside. Thats one of the problems - the stupid break with conventions - the criminal fascination. Throw it all away - and go nowhere! But the actress plays this difficult part very interesting. On the other side - there the parents - who are the pendant to the two girls. The have a car - a hotel suite - the have money and live in world with music of the opera. But the film stand always in some distance to seem. There is no much explaining of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the center of this film, there is one scene you will never forget. The two girls got to a casting. And there they should say how they find together. In this scene Toni will lying on. She said a fantastic story-has nothing to do with her. And then Nina will say the truth. She said it in an introversion way. There is no exhibition in it. She looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here. Thats a great moment. In the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than Toni goes away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, The film will end - in the German way of coolneß - rubbish - here the circle of sadness is closing. But there was a moment - where is happening something else - and this moment was important. He is more than German coolneß - and this moments are rare in the German cinema in this time!&#39;,
   &#39;This movie is a great. The plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts of with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called &#34;when you stub your toe on the moon&#34; It reminds me of Sinatra\&#39;s song High Hopes, it is fun and inspirational. The Music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir &#34;Saggy&#34; Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a great Date movie. This is a movie you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I love this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely like this movie.&#39;,
   &#39;Are you a giraffe?... ask John to Nadia, and she, sure of responding well, responds him: yes. In this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don\&#39;t know each other, and at the same time, the questions and doubts in &#34;Birthday Girl&#34;. A film that i heard a lot of times, but i don\&#39;t dare to see... until two hours of write this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Birthday Girl&#34; is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count, at the same time, that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actress (Besides she is pretty and intelligent) that i have ever seen. &#34;Birthday Girl&#34; is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet. The woman that he finds comes from Russia. She seems to be that delicate woman, normal, not more. One day, in her birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. The man, begin to discover certain things. Since here, he don\&#39;t going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot. Much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don\&#39;t novel. But &#34;Birthday Girl&#34; is just the opposite. This movie is full of good surprises, good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined. This romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind. &#34;Birthday Girl&#34; have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes, but at the same time, certain touching nature, and makes it so deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Birthday Girl&#34; is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes violent, but at the end, is totally satisfactory. And I\&#39;m not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.&#39;,
   &#39;I had watched (and recorded) this a few years back on local TV and, having been underwhelmed by it, I subsequently erased the tape; however, when it was released by MGM as part of a &#34;Midnite Movie&#34; double-feature DVD of Curtis Harrington/Shelley Winters films for a very affordable price, I couldn\&#39;t resist giving it a second look (this has since gone out-of-print). Actually, I received the DVD a few months ago but only now, with Harrington\&#39;s passing, did I get to it; thankfully, this time around I was more receptive to the film and, in fact, now consider it one of the more satisfying WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? (1962) imitations (with whom, incidentally, it shared screenwriter Henry Farrell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film offers a splendid evocation of 1930s Depression America - with its child-star craze and sensational murders (exploited during the fake newsreel opening); it\&#39;s stylishly made (kudos to Lucien Ballard\&#39;s cinematography and the set design by Eugene Lourie\&#39;) and boasts an effective David Raksin score. Shelley Winters, Debbie Reynolds and Michael MacLiammoir deliver excellent performances; the latter is especially impressive as the larger-than-life and vaguely sinister diction coach (though he ultimately proves a mere red herring!). Also featured are Dennis Weaver and Agnes Moorehead (hers is only a cameo, really, as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radio).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids (including an amusing Mae West imitation), but I personally wasn\&#39;t bothered by them; the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and (perhaps needlessly) convoluted plot. Reynolds - a musical star herself - is ideally cast as the dancing-school owner and, despite their on-set rivalry, she and Winters work well together. The latter, in fact, gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO? (1971); the narrative, then, comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected Grand Guignol-type denouement. Apparently, the film was toned down (it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism!) by producer Martin Ransohoff - against Harrington\&#39;s wishes - in order to get a PG rating...&#39;,
   &#34;I wasn&#39;t expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you&#39;d expect to be living next door. They are ordinary flesh-and-blood people, not like the typical Hollywood fare. They face an all too common problem--debilitating illness. But the story-line grips the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, script, direction, and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story. Give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Winchester \&#39;73&#34; marked the first of a series of westerns involving James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. As in most of them Stewart\&#39;s hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The title refers to a &#34;one in a thousand&#34; rifle that is up for competition at a rifle shoot held in Dodge City on July 4, 1876. Into town comes Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his sidekick High Spade (Millard Mitchell) who are on the trail of Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for a past dastardly deed. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) running saloon girl Lola (Shelley Winters) out of town. It turns out that Dutch Henry is also in town for the rifle shoot. Lin and Dutch Henry shoot it out for the coveted prize with Lin winning but Dutch Henry robs Lin of the gun and escapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lin and High Spade trail Dutch Henry across country where they encounter Lola with her cowardly beau Steve Miller (Charles Drake) hold up in a U.S. Cavalry camp awaiting attack by the Indians led by Young Bull (Rock Hudson) who has acquired the prized rifle by murdering wily gun runner John McIntyre. He had got the weapon by cheating Dutch Henry at poker. Young Bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to Steve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Lola and Steve meet up with notorious gunman Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea) who kills Steve and takes the valued rifle and Lola for himself. When Dean meets up with Dutch Henry, he allows him to take back &#34;his gun&#34; planning to murder him later. In the town of Tuscosa, Lin kills Dean as Dutch Henry\&#39;s plans of holding up the bank go bad and he escapes into the hills with Lin in pursuit. In one of the best final shoot outs ever, the two meet in the final showdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I believe that this movie was the only one of the Stewart/Mann collaborations that was shot in B&amp;W. It is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the &#34;wide open spaces&#34; and in particular, the final showdown. Stewart playing against type, plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge, an emotion that he would carry into future films with Mann.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As in most Universal westerns, this one boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day. In addition to those mentioned above, J.C. Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as various henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff pursuing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as rookie soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles in the Dodge City sequence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A classic western in every sense of the word. It was responsible for re-generating Stewart\&#39;s career as an action star.&#39;,
   &#39;I can\&#39;t tell you all how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say that this move is &#34;too confusing&#34; or &#34;like swimming in drying concrete&#34;. I say that these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever loved playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons... this movie is for you, (especially if you got into the Oriental Adventures) I\&#39;m just sorry that I did not get to see this movie on the big screen. (Just more incentive to get my own big screen t.v. :-)&#39;,
   &#39;Thank god ABC picked this up instead of Fox. The best description (for those in the know) is really Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best way possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller but I certainly enjoy his productions. I also enjoy checkered floors, pies, talking toys, gravelings and other mischievous items :) While a bit &#34;Burtonesque&#34;, I certainly think this enjoys its own niche that doesn\&#39;t require J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground. Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest!&#39;,
   &#39;This movie is great, the music &#34;with the exception of the very first song in the movie&#34; was awesome. The story line is awesome too, it\&#39;s just basically a wonderfull movie, for ALL ages. I found the last battle scene awesome! Basically this was a great flick!&#39;,
   &#39;\&#39;\&#39;Ranma ½&#34; is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, that is not only a comedy, but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are great friends and trained together during many years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo\&#39;s: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranma and Akane fight all the time,specially because both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda,many new characters and situations starts to happen. They also discover the reason of the transformation: while fighting, Ranma and his father fell in a cursed river. But not only them had this kind of fate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you watched \&#39;\&#39;Ranma 1/2\&#39;\&#39; and liked, I would recommend you \&#39;\&#39;Inuyasha\&#39;\&#39; and \&#39;\&#39;Maison Ikkoku&#34;, two other good creations from Rumiko\&#39;s hands.&#39;,
   &#34;I was going to give it an 8, but since you people made 6.5 out of a lot better votes, I had to up my contribution. The river Styx was pure genius. Sure, Woody was his perennial stuff, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really hilarious, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialog was clever enough, and Woody&#39;s card tricks at the parties, along with the reaction from the upper crust, were fun to watch. This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be. And a plus, a little Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice to go along with it. And of course, did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy? Charles Dance is always entertaining, as was Hugh Jackman.&#34;,
   &#34;This game show lasted just one season, but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual aptitude and a steady hand. One false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize, even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer. It was always exciting as the contestant began drawing, wondering if they would complete the drawing or be buzzed out; allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest. It was a light-hearted show, but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally. Rarely seen, the game show did not survive past one single season. Only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show, as it proved to be quite unpopular, even though game shows were making a big return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950&#39;s game shows. But it was a unique concept for a game show, and one that has as yet never been seen again.&#34;,
   &#34;I couldn&#39;t wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns &amp; Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely worth seeing, but lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred &amp; Ginger movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but boy does she in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up wonderfully with Astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several nice songs, particularly fun are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns &amp; Allen. I had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.&#34;,
   &#34;This place in England during 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She doesn&#39;t want them but reluctantly takes them in. It seems she is studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (OK--I realize this is a family film but--College of Witchcraft??? Come ON!!) Before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war (???) and she seeks down the head Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this when I was 9 and vaguely remember loving it. It sure doesn&#39;t hold up as an adult! The story is silly (even for a fantasy), the kids are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly obnoxious. Also Roddy McDowall is third billed and only appears in two short scenes! There&#39;s also a trip to the Isle of Naboombu which is run by animated animals. I thought that might be fun but the animation is poor (for Disney) and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals. There are a few saving graces here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; the songs (while forgettable) are pleasant; the long dance sequence on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy and the Oscar-winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end. But the weak story line, poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down. I heard the extended version is even worse! I can only give this a 7.&#34;,
   &#34;An adaption of the book &#39;Finding Fish&#39;. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and an always stunning performance by Denzel Washington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was incredible on so many levels and I was disappointed that it didn&#39;t win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time that&#39;s why it was overlooked. I strongly recommend this film to everyone, you&#39;ll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is Antwone Fisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like inspirational true stories, then watch Antwone Fisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&#34;,
   &#39;Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman\&#39;s performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis\&#39; portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesn\&#39;t give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s typical of Hoffman\&#39;s way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voight\&#39;s Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines &#34;loser&#34;), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape.&#39;,
   &#34;I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film. I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film. This happened quite by accident, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television. The first two things I noticed about that film were that it was 1) technically amateurish and 2) brilliantly written. When I read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks, I started to get interesting. When he said his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie I&#39;d seen on DVD a week prior, I decided I had to go and check it out. The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks, although the two films are nothing alike content wise. Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing. Whereas Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy, he&#39;s always running one way or another, filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant. I can tell from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up, young men still have the same problems they always have. The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular, crafts wonderfully honest characters, and has them do completely believable things. As far as indie cinema goes, this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint, but from an artistic one, it is very close.&#34;,
   &#39;This is one of the best ensemble comedy/musical &#34;B&#34; film\&#39;s that I have seen (and since I\&#39;m in my 40\&#39;s now and only seeing this now, I am not an expert but I have seen all the well known films out there). When there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time, usually the comedy interferes with the musical bits, and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comedic flow. Call me in a crazy kind of mood but when I saw this on TCM Europe, I was laughing out loud with pleasure! So who delivered the laughs for me? Without a doubt Mischa Auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs, he even steals the ending, it was great! Speaking of which, I think why this movie works is because although L &amp; H are a selling point (and why I got hooked to watch this one (them and Hal Roach), I love them in their early Hal Roach stuff), this keeps them at a minimum and stays squarely on ADULT fare (by 1930\&#39;s standards, and not that far from today\&#39;s standards if you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there, and I also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only &#34;ugly&#34; femme in the 30\&#39;s movies that actually turns me on (something tells me she was a spitfire in real life); and the musical numbers have a real professional production (Busby Berkley\&#39;ish) quality, that blew me away from what I am used to in this genre. I could go on and on, but rest assured I really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 I saw it on TCM Europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on TCM USA. Good Stuff!&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;A Cry in the Dark&#34; is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting, and incredibly though provoking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family\&#39;s tent, while camping on the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy, as she always does. But the one thing that helps &#34;A Cry in the Dark&#34; never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.&#39;,
   &#34;It&#39;s a tale that could have taken place anywhere really, given the right circumstances. Street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing. The aging entertainer finds/buys a male child to pass his art to. From there, we follow them through the rigors of their challenging, but free life along the river. Traveling town to town, he performs and has some degree of notoriety. Despite the times and the influences, the man is kind and good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the performances are first rate, especially Xu Zhu, who portrays the street performer. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful, and downright strong, and withstands the overt prejudices well. The two protagonists, along with supporting help from the kind opera singer, Master Liang (an interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have mentioned this film&#39;s remote similarities to BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); yet this film can&#39;t stand easily on its own, any resemblance is remote at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS, is the ending. It was weak, cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the needless manipulation for? What a shame. To bring a fine motion picture that far, only to surrender to emotional (and corny) pathos like that. It frankly made this film good, instead of the classic, it should&#39;ve been. That aside, the KING OF MASKS is still very well worth your time. I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films. Highly recommended.&#34;,
   &#39;Deanna Durbin really did save Universal from bankruptcy and enabled it to remain a big studio. By the mid 30s most of the big directors that had been at Universal eg Milestone, Browning and Wyler had gone. Only James Whale remained but his prestigious horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in a short &#34;Every Sunday&#34; and initially Garland was suggested for the role of Penny in &#34;Three Smart Girls&#34;. When Garland was unavailable Universal switched to Durbin. Initially she had been definitely a supporting player but her potential was so vivid that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by Henry Koster the film had a European touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in &#34;Switzerland&#34;. The &#34;three smart girls&#34; of the title - three sisters, Joan (Nan Grey), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) are sailing with Penny giving her glorious voice to &#34;My Heart is Singing&#34;. All is not too well on the home front - their father is planning to remarry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes) so the three girls with the help of their trusty nurse (Lucille Watson) decide to go to New York and reunite him with their mother. Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as Robert Taylor\&#39;s stern mother in &#34;Waterloo Bridge&#34; (1941).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donna is a gold-digger who, along with her scatty mother (Alice Brady), is determined to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For someone with no film experience Deanna is wonderful as Penny, a typical pesky, over enthusiastic kid sister and she is as pretty as a picture. When she sings &#34;Someone to Care for Me&#34; to her father you will just melt - what a glorious voice she had. She also has one of the funniest lines in the film. When her father consoles her with &#34;I\&#39;ll take you to the zoo tomorrow&#34;, she replies &#34;Oh I can see enough monkeys around here&#34;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire a &#34;count&#34; (Mischa Auer)to romance Donna. They arrange to meet at a nightclub but due to a mix-up Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is mistaken for the count and Donna falls for him (she thinks he owns half of Australia!!!) The plan backfires as he falls for Kay and Donna wants to hasten her marriage to Judson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penny decides to take matters into her own hands and runs away. She is taken to the local police station where she charms the cops with her rendition of &#34;Il Bacio&#34; (she is trying to convince them she is a young opera singer.) Everything ends happily with their mother (Nella Walker) sailing over to patch things up with their dad and in the meantime Donna makes the acquaintance of the phoney count (Mischa Auer) and sails off to Australia with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&#39;,
   &#39;This incredibly formulaic flick from the &#34;Walker, Texas Ranger&#34; squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. However, it\&#39;s a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertains. That\&#39;s all it was meant to do and it does so. The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn\&#39;t half bad. The acting is also decent, which isn\&#39;t much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you\&#39;re a fan of the genre (and of &#34;Walker, Texas Ranger&#34;), you will definitely love this. If not, then don\&#39;t waste your time. 8/10&#39;,
   &#39;Brian De Palma\&#39;s undeniable virtuosity can\&#39;t really camouflage the fact that his plot here is a thinly disguised &#34;Psycho&#34; carbon copy, but he does provide a genuinely terrifying climax. His &#34;Blow Out&#34;, made the next year, was an improvement.&#39;,
   &#39;I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the LDS faith. I think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial, since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early Mormon church. It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of the church, the single most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of Brigham Young as one that had &#34;knowingly deceived&#34; church members into believing he had been called to be Joseph\&#39;s successor as the prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both Brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather he led them confidently by inspiration. The point is important for Mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith: that God truly speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not you believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what Brigham himself believed.&#39;,
   &#34;Everyone knows about this &#39;&#39;Zero Day&#39;&#39; event. What I think this movie did that Elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were. They showed their life for about a year. Throughout the movie we get to like them, to laugh with them even though we totally know what they&#39;re gonna do. And THAT gives me the chills. Cause I felt guilty to be cheered by their comments, and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy. Even though I KNEW what was gonna happen you know? Even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 I thought this was funny but still I was horrified to see their heads blown off. Of course I was. I got to like them. They were wicked, maybe, but I felt like they were really normal guys, that they didn&#39;t really realize it. But I knew they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s, IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone, can be planning something crazy, and that we won&#39;t even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that&#39;s why I can&#39;t go to sleep right now. There&#39;s still this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.&#34;,
   &#39;I first saw this film 40 years ago on N.Y. television, and thought it was a depressing look at the future. Wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing. (&#34; no private airplanes&#34;. The 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to British film goers doing the war. The concept of the future, and the Korda an Co. concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film. The very best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss. A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from Absolutely Fabulous comedy series. It is interesting to note that the Boss\&#39;s negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time Churchill.&#39;,
   &#39;For all of you that don\&#39;t speak swedish: The swedish [original] title of this film; &#34;Rånarna&#34; translates into something in the line of &#34;The Robbers&#34;. This fact is the main problem I have with the film, cause it\&#39;s not really about the robbers at all. It\&#39;s about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies. A regular desk job one would think, but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands, as the story goes, even shooting one of the robbers... Exactly: We\&#39;ve seen this before. The fact that there\&#39;s a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn\&#39;t really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it\&#39;s masterfully executed in all ways, that the actors are as great as they are and don\&#39;t overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I really loved about this film is the fact that it\&#39;s music sets the right mood when it\&#39;s needed, but is absent for the rest of the time, which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and car-chases spread throughout the film. A nice touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that he\&#39;s not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background, but that\&#39;s something you have to neglect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it\&#39;s an entertaining film that steals more money in it\&#39;s plot than time from you. 7/10&#39;,
   &#39;I just got done watching &#34;Kalifornia&#34; on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it back in July of 2001. You would think that with the recent wave of serial killer films, that &#34;Kalifornia&#34; would be amongst some of the earlier films worthy of mention but hasn\&#39;t. Perhaps if this film had been released sometime between like 1996-1999, maybe it might have been more successful. In my opinion, &#34;Kalifornia&#34; is much different from most serial killer films released during the late 1990s. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today\&#39;s serial killer films like &#34;Seven&#34; or &#34;The Bone Collector&#34;. Many serial killer films have shown a killer but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to actually learn anything about them. &#34;Kalifornia&#34; is a film that actually tries to break through that barrier and actually understand the criminal mind. It tries to answer questions like &#34;why do they do the things they do? Is it because of something that happened in their past? Does it make them feel superior or powerful? Or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill?&#34; These are some of the things that &#34;Kalifornia&#34; tries to answer but also leaves room for us to try and figure things out for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an everlasting impression as Early Grayce. When we first meet Early in the beginning of the film, we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual. When we first see him, it\&#39;s late at night. Early is possibly drunk. We then see him pick up a rock, throw it off a bridge, and it later lands on the windshield of a passing car. Pitt is fierce in this film. It is always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people. It\&#39;s funny that this would later lead him play a true loon like in &#34;12 Monkeys&#34; and that he would be on the other end of the spectrum in David Fincher\&#39;s &#34;Seven&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;What a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels it never gets: Science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated, cultured audience.....the kind of English language movie only done in pre-1960 England (and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever done in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main characters in The Man In The White Suit(1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, science reference words like &#34;polymer&#34; and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like &#34;long chain molecules&#34; and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate major USA cinema.......it\&#39;s a carefully acted, intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated English actors (who play educated, accomplished people), and it\&#39;s all done with comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony which ancient Greek dramatists would have approved of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody should see this movie, and someday, somehow, some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s wonderful.&#39;,
   &#39;Interesting how much more realistic Brosnan\&#39;s performance is to that of the original James Bond novels when compared to the bond films. He\&#39;s neurotic, paranoid, an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot. This is perfect break for him, even so much as to make fun of the bond icon. &#34;I\&#39;m a mess, a parody of myself&#34; he says. It doesn\&#39;t get any better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No and this is very much how Ian Fleming had portrayed James Bond. Personally I never liked Brosnan as Bond because he fit the icon too closely. There was nothing for him to personalize the character with, as compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. Its great to see Brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall. A shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with. It\&#39;s an impressive portrayal, and having Greg Kinear to ground him, is just poetic. This movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in &#34;My Blue Heaven&#34;, but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.&#39;,
   &#34;I remember seeing this film years ago on, I think, BBC2. I would very much like to view it again - does anyone know how I can obtain a copy? As I remember, it was an especially powerful movie, in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks. Apart from that I really can&#39;t recall too much about the story - which is why I want to view it again! I have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - perhaps there is no DVD or VHS of this film on the market. Would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this. Thanks very much in advance for your assistance. Best regards, Albany234@googlemail.com&#34;,
   &#34;I grew up watching Scooby and have been a fan forever. This cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to viewers. The Crooks in Mask routine gets old and This cartoon is a change from that. It&#39;s not meant to replace the Scooby gang it&#39;s just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers I&#39;m sure. The cartoon&#39;s focus is on Scooby and Shaggy who inherits a large sum of money and use that money to thwart world conquest plans from a mad scientist and his goons. Small homages of the gang and the gang themselves are featured from time to time. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog, along with the jokes that come with it. Just Enjoythe Cartoon and support the creators/writers and producers so that this won&#39;t be the last Scooby Cartoon.&#34;,
   &#39;This Film was really eye-opening. I have seen this film several times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12. The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or just Plain going the extra mile to insult him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike!&#39;,
   &#39;Since I watched it for the first time, &#34;Piedras&#34; is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures I actually could watch over and over again. The great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women (all of them somehow interconnected) with deep understanding and sensibility. Ramón Salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut, and proves himself as an efficient actors\&#39; director. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that all performances are excellent, though. Of all leading ladies, they range from average (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer Mónica Cervera, who convincingly plays Antonia San Juan\&#39;s retarded daughter. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl\&#39;s male nurse, and there are nice small turns from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Piedras&#34; is beautifully written and filmed, when I watched it I got so moved that I couldn\&#39;t stop thinking of it for days. I highly recommend it.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;d have to say this is one of the best animated films I\&#39;ve ever seen. I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gorgeous color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with &#34;Scat,&#34; is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. &#34;Sid&#34; the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn\&#39;t just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters. This isn\&#39;t interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one only brief one and there is nothing offensive, language-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If more animated movies were this good, I\&#39;d own more.&#39;,
   &#34;This is surprisingly above average slasher, that&#39;s enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. All the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. I bought this at a pawn shop for a 1$, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus I loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy. The finale was really cool, as I loved how they defeated the killer, and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well, plus all the characters except for Ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable!. It&#39;s decently made and written, and I thought it was quite creative and original at times as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. This killer didn&#39;t mess around, and I loved it, and Slasher fans(like myself) should really enjoy this film, plus The opening was really wicked too, with them filming the movie!. This is a surprisingly above average slasher, that&#39;s enjoyable,and well made, with some decent gore, and I say it&#39;s well worth the watch!. The Direction is good. Kimble Rendall does a good! job here with solid camera work, using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace. The acting is solid!. Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely well,and I had troubles feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better towards the end, but not by much, I&#39;m surprised she decided to do this film, nonetheless she did an excellent job!. Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is menacing, creepy and had one hell of a mask, and this guy didn&#39;t mess around, he was fantastic!. Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5&#34;,
   &#39;I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated, but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue, which, please remember, is all tongue in cheek. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else-well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(title song lyric)&#34;he can sink a beer, he can pick a queer, in his latest double-breasted Bondi gear.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(another song lyric) &#34;All pommies are bastards, bastards, or worse, and England is the a**e-hole of the universe.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(during a television interview on an &#34;arty program&#34;): Mr Mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you\&#39;ve been in England? (Barry\&#39;s response)Flamin\&#39; bull-artists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(while chatting up a naive young pom girl): Mr Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants back in Australia? (Barry\&#39;s response) Abos? I\&#39;ve never seen an Abo in me life. Mum does most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) round our place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser Aussie flick. If you can get a copy of it, watch and enjoy.&#39;,
   &#39;i just finished watching Dressed to Kill,which is written and directed by Brian De Palma.the DVD had both the&#34;R&#34; rated version and the unrated version.i chose the unrated version.since i have yet to view the &#34;R&#34; rated version,i can\&#39;t be completely sure of the difference.there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version.i guess you could call this scene soft core porn.if this sort of thing may offend you,i would suggest you view the &#34;R&#34; rated version.but i digress.Any comment from here on refers to the unrated version.this is a murder mystery/ psychological horror/suspense movie.there is very little violence and blood.there is however one death sequence of note.the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic.however the blood it self does not look real.it is reminiscent of how a 70\&#39;s slasher film would look.i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself,to give the scene a low budget feel.most of the violence,or rather possibility of such,is implied.the film is very well paced.as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose,which i find very rare when compared to many of today\&#39;s films. anyway,i also thought the acting was good,especially Angie Dickinson.and Micheal Cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role,which works brilliantly in this case.the movie also has one great twist in it,in my mind,although some people might find it predictable.the only complaint(and it\&#39;s really more of an observation)i have is that i thought the character played by Nancy Allen could have been fleshed out more,especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time.but i think she does a good job with what she is given.and this doesn\&#39;t really take away from the quality of the film.the film also has a strong moral to it,which is even more relevant today.but the movie doesn\&#39;t hit you over the head with it.i also really liked the musical score,composed by Pino Dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original Psycho.to me,this music really elevated the movie.i thought this movie was brilliant.for me,Dressed to Kill(1980)is 10/10&#39;,
   &#39;Pushing Daisies is just a lovely fairy tale, with shades of &#34;Amelie&#34;\&#39;s aesthetic and romance. It\&#39;s got a beautiful palette, its shots well thought out and detailed, its names and dialogue whimsical and too cutesy to be real, its imagination great, and its romance deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the blue in the sky pop out at you, as blue can\&#39;t be found in the rest of the sets or shots (with few exceptions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch a weirdly natural and totally satisfying song break out of a scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its score is gorgeous, its cast is supremely likable, there\&#39;s great music, and the two leading romantic stars can\&#39;t touch each other or she\&#39;ll die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I had wished they found a way around this one, but c\&#39;est la vie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simply a show that it is a pleasure to spend an hour with, and I recommend it highly. There hasn\&#39;t been other television quite like it, and I would like to see more. It got me through a flu one crappy week, as it makes for good company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring it back!&#39;,
   &#39;I have just recently read the novel &#34;mother night&#34;, I\&#39;ve owned the dvd for some time now, and watch it every so often. Few movies I own and have seen have made me think and question as much as Mother Night has, I am amazed at the brilliance not only of Vonnegut, but of the translation of his text to screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it must be done on dvd, and it must be accompanied by the director\&#39;s commentary on the film. To see how they took a fairly simple story, yet complex in its substance and dialogue, and made it work so well, I think any viewer will be amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The omissions in the movie are few from the text, and do not detract from it much, the movie might as well be the book, and is the best adaptation I have ever seen. I so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will change you if you do.&#39;,
   &#39;My personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its political/historical underpinnings like so many (American) reviewers tend to do. This is not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It is about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West. Just like the guys are torn between Esther and everybody else, and Esther is torn between the &#34;Tovarish Joe&#34; and the guys. There is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director. Movies like this make freedom feel more important. It is not just &#34;another Eastern European coming of age film&#34;...it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom.&#39;,
   &#34;This film is one of Tom Cruise&#39;s finest films. He captures the audiences imaginations with his role of David Aames. His character can relate to us all in some way.The story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film. I never really watched Cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent. My favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth. If you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try. It&#39;s one of those films that once you&#39;ve started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it. My opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what I did and it became one of my favourite films of all time. It&#39;s A* 10/10 I promise once you watch it, it will stick with you and you will like it forever.&#34;,
   &#39;Robert Standish\&#39;s novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a Ceylonese tea plantation... So the events of the Ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to William Dieterle\&#39;s film...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about a rich powerful planter (Peter Finch), who brings a charming and tender beauty (Elizabeth Taylor), into the jungle as his bride... The plantation, of course, is endangered by some kind of wild life... For this reason Taylor \x97 elegant as never in dazzling costumes \x97 finds herself in a strange atmosphere... The echo determination of a ghost, the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father, a highly dangerous disease, and the fury of wild animals...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her confusion, boredom and annoyance Elizabeth Taylor looks to a friendly face, a pretentious foreman (Dana Andrews), who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With echoes of &#34;Jane Eyre,&#34; the mysterious Yorkshire mansion with a brooding master, and &#34;Rebecca,&#34; the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife, &#34;Elephant Walk&#34; is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow, exotic dances with rage excessively colorful, stampeding big bull elephants, amazing mansion set on fire, all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie gave Liz a change of scenery, and allowed her more creative energy and self-respect than most of her other willful debutante-rebels\x85 The wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will, and so Taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for\x85&#39;,
   &#34;This show is awesome! and I&#39;ve seen it about 6 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted it may be lacking in educational content as some people like those sort of movies, but I think it&#39;s great, very funny and excellently written!&#34;,
   &#34;This is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on TV at the mo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed right from the start. Don&#39;t be put off if your not a sci fi nut (like me...) This could be happening on earth, the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting. there are no space ships or laser guns (None yet anyway) So far I&#39;ve seen up to s01 e04 and I&#39;m gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast play there roles with pasion. Eric stoltz is especially strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show really stands alone well, it doesn&#39;t matter if you watched BSG or not, in fact they are quite different. I&#39;ve read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but I would say ignore them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really positive start to a show. Lets hope they don&#39;t cann it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; is a outstanding invention of movie making, probably never duplicated. I rank it with &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; and &#34;African Queen,&#34; although it is a totally different type of movie than &#34;African Queen.&#34; &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, there is the combination of B&amp;W and color footage - as in &#34;Oz,&#34; but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in &#34;Oz.&#34; In &#34;Stairway&#34; the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another brilliant aspect of &#34;Stairway&#34; is the concept of &#34;time&#34; and how it is used here. How could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still \x96 literally? And then there is the Stairway itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me. &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; is a true gem.&#39;,
   &#34;Well, this is probably one of the best movies I&#39;ve seen and I love it so much that I&#39;ve memorized most of the script (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks wind) and even with the script in my head I still like to watch it for Jerry Lee, that German Shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who&#39;s smarter. The tag line holds true as well. Not to mention the acting is great, though Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (Check filmography under CSI if you don&#39;t know what I mean). It&#39;s too bad that this movie only contained the single issue Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with, it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had up their sleeve.&#34;,
   &#39;Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still, what was there was interesting. The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF (the feature Still Life/Sanxia Haoren &amp; the documentary Dong) which were also built around that subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&amp;A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in China itself.&#39;,
   &#39;While in the barn of Kent Farm with Shelby waiting for Chloe, Clark is attacked and awakes in a mental institution in the middle of a session with Dr. Hudson. The psychologist tells him that for five years he has been delusional, believing that he has come from Krypton and had superpowers. Clark succeeds to escape, and meets Lana, Martha and Lex that confirm the words of Dr. Hudson. Only Chloe believe on his words, but she is also considered insane. Clark fights to find the truth about his own personality and origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Labyrinth&#34; is undoubtedly the most intriguing episode of &#34;Smallville&#34;. The writer was very luck and original denying the whole existence of the powerful boy from Krypton. The annoying hum gives the sensation of disturbance and the identity mysterious saver need to be clarified. My vote is nine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Labirinto&#34; (&#34;Labyrinth&#34;)&#39;,
   &#39;I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay. I thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called &#34;The Fear:Halloween Night&#34;. I expected this movie to be somewhat of a Halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy. But it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people(including his mother) and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit. Pretty good for a sequel and I never even seen the first.&#39;,
   &#34;In our household, we are enormous fans of A Christmas Carol and watch virtually every version each Christmas, including the old 1938 Reginald Owen and the modern 1999 Patrick Stewart. Our overall favorite is the 1951 black &amp; white classic, because Alastair Sim IS Ebeneezer Scrooge and his conversion rings the truest. However, this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely &amp; entertaining story, quite faithful generally to Dickens&#39; novel. (See my comments on the other film adaptations, if interested)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, George C. Scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesn&#39;t make a bad Scrooge. I adore his sideburns, his long topcoat &amp; hat. He cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot, and quite a handsome gentleman. However, sometimes it seems Scott is enjoying his role as Scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he ought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rendition has the best overall Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. Somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending. Filmed in the town of Shrewsbury, England, it just seems somehow very British. The film has a lovely musical score, with wonderful, lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale. Sometimes I could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marley&#39;s anguished ghost (with his wonderful jaw dropping scene) and the three Spirits are all quite convincing. Christmas Past is a lovely ethereal lady, Christmas Present wonderfully giant and jovial, Christmas Yet To Come shrouded and foreboding as always. However, I found Scrooge&#39;s nephew, Fred, a wee bit quiet &amp; grim, not nearly as jolly &amp; hearty as he should be. I like the nephew&#39;s wife, whom they&#39;ve named Janet, with her lovely, sprightly period hairstyle. Instead of blind man&#39;s bluff, they&#39;ve concocted a game called Similes for the nephew&#39;s Christmas dinner party, which is a cute little touch, Scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cratchits and their somewhat meagre (though much appreciated) Christmas dinner are well depicted, with Bob (David Warner) suitably sympathetic and long-suffering in his miles of scarf. Mrs. Cratchit is charmingly portrayed by Susannah York, who also starred with George C. Scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of Jane Eyre. Above all, this version has unquestionably the best Tiny Tim, not only an adorable &amp; endearing little waif but sickly. With those dark circles under his eyes, the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a delightful &amp; heartwarming version of the holiday classic. With its festive atmosphere, it&#39;s sure to put you in the spirit of the season.&#34;,
   &#39;Bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. This one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: &#34;To Have and To Have Not&#34; (1944) and &#34;The Big Sleep&#34; (1945), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. Granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but I think through no fault of her own. I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British upper-crust lady. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no Spaniard. It was hard to keep straight which country people were from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the black and white cinematography. Mood is used to great affect - I especially liked the fog scene. The lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bacall is just gorgeous. Boyer just doesn\&#39;t fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and Bacall together was a little strange. Not great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still really liked this picture. There is great tension and it moves along well enough. I must say I found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting cast. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal. Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child\&#39;s murderer is quite disturbing. Lorre also does quite well in his slimy, snake portrayal of Conteras - a sleazy coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child Else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger). Turns out she later married Auie Murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage.&#39;,
   &#39;I did not have too much interest in watching The Flock.Andrew Lau co-directed the masterpiece trilogy of Infernal Affairs but he had been fired from The Flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called Niels Mueller.I had the feeling that Lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study,so they fired him and hired another director.This usually does not work well (let\&#39;s remember The Invasion).But The Flock resulted to be better than what I expected.It\&#39;s not a great film but it\&#39;s an interesting and entertaining thriller.The character development is very well done and I could know the characters very well.Also,the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible.Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances.Now,let\&#39;s go to the negative points.One element which really bothered me (there was a moment in which it irritated me) was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more &#34;attitude&#34; and style.That tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary.Plus,I think the film should have been more ambitious.In spite of that,I recommend The Flock as a good thriller.It\&#39;s not memorable at all,but it\&#39;s entertaining.&#39;,
   &#34;I liked this TV show because it was it&#39;s own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her aunties in the house and they are both witches as well. Well this took her about a few weeks of getting used to. When she used her powers for the first time it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. She had to turn back time and repeat a day. This series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series but it wore thin when she moved out of her house and to an apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and I stopped watching.I loved her aunties they were so funny and the other one was really ditzy. I loved Valerie and I hated Sabrina&#39;s enemy Libby she was ugly.&#34;,
   &#39;Flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flick exposes all the clichés, and then some! Excruciatingly bad (Downs-Syndrome!) actors. Terribly heavy self important dialog. Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. Jarring editing. Pointless plot points. All wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It achieves exactly what it was designed to. A hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders, to show to their parents when they ask them what they\&#39;ve been doing for the last two years! After &#34;What Is It?&#34; received its Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films! He supposedly blew up at the info. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, see it and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come.&#39;,
   &#39;Resident Evil:code veronica is a great well made video game,it has great graphics,very comfortable controls,a great storyline and high fun factor.The storyline to this is Claire Redfield gets taken to an island for trespassing on Umbrella grounds,and reaking havoc at they\&#39;re main lab while looking for her brother.Code veronica\&#39;s graphics are very good,the fire and rain effects are great looking.The controls are comfy,but the button pattern doesnt fit the Dreamcast control,makeing it hard to get used to.Its still fun going around some wierd disturbing place,shooting the guts out of zombies.Code:veronica also has a little bit of &#34;Romance&#34; between the two main characters.You also get to play as Chris Redfield,from Resident Evil 1.The sound in this game is better than ever,for example,even though I hate the new feature,When the giant spiders crawl,they\&#39;re feet make a disturbing scampering sound,and the guns sound alot more realistic.Great graphics,outstanding story,comfy controls,and realistic sound makes Resident Evil Code:Veronica a definite loved. I give it a 10 out of 10.&#39;,
   &#39;This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make John Woo say, &#34;Enough already!&#34; Of course, it isn\&#39;t nearly as beautiful as Woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is framed for murdering the Governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to Eric to clear her name. Wilson gets to pull Van Damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. I particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. My other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in Don\&#39;s simulator. It is merely a chance to show off some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effects circa 1995.&#39;,
   &#39;Greetings again from the darkness. Remember all the &#34;What happened to Woody Allen?&#34; jokes? Even Mr. Allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same &#34;funny&#34; films. As with any great artist, Mr. Allen\&#39;s craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans, while picking up others. Last year\&#39;s masterpiece &#34;Matchpoint&#34; showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of &#34;Annie Hall&#34; and &#34;Manhattan&#34;. What is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that Mr. New York himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country. Apparently he actually likes England!! While filming &#34;Matchpoint&#34;, Mr. Allen became enamored with Scarlett Johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor. This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years. Scarlett, while risking overexposure, must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light. She is unafraid to look and act like a real person. In &#34;Scoop&#34;, she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and, in many scenes, delivers the real punchline to Mr. Allen\&#39;s straight man. Of course, any time Mr. Allen decides to put himself in front of the camera, he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in - which is fine, because few do it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice support work from Ian McShane and Hugh Jackman. In fact, Mr. Jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace Brosnan as the new Bond. As with most of Allen\&#39;s films, the star is the script, not the actors. Although Scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished Allen and Jackman, what makes this one crackle is the dialogue ... especially the banter between Allen and Scarlett. If you are not a huge Woody the actor fan, fear not. He does limit his screen time and he is quite effective, except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place. Another Woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and &#34;Scoop&#34; is no exception ... especially the Strauss composition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Scoop&#34; is a nice cross between &#34;Annie Hall&#34; and the best of the Marx Brothers films or the Cary Grant comedies. Yes it is an adult comedy, but it is actually very cute ... especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy!!&#39;,
   &#39;Butch the peacemaker? Evidently. After the violent beginning with Spike, Tom and Jerry all swinging away at each other, Butch calls a halt and wants to know why. It\&#39;s a good question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Cats can get along with dogs, can\&#39;t they?&#34; he asks Tom, who nods his head in agreement. &#34;Mice can get along with cats, right?&#34; Jerry nods &#34;no,&#34; and then sees that isn\&#39;t the right answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go inside and Butch draws up a &#34;Peace Treaty&#34; (complete with professional artwork!). Most of the rest, and the bulk of the cartoon, is the three of them being extremely nice to one another What a refreshing change-of-pace. I found it fun to watch. I can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you knew the peace wasn\&#39;t going to last. A big piece of steak spells the death of the &#34;peace treaty&#34; but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual Tom &amp; Jerry clever humor.&#39;,
   &#39;A well-made and imaginative production, refreshingly free from cliché, this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions: the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage. Expertly directed by Alan Gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement, the film provides freshness in nearly every scene, as felon Martin Steckert (Richard Harris), believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved, contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan, following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood. Often bursting into song or dancing a few steps, the capricious Steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and, as police close in for an inevitable showdown, the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection, as discerned by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant (James Coburn) who is in charge of the manhunt for Steckert and his &#34;prisoner&#34;. This is an engrossing story, worth telling, a quickly-paced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by Harris, fine turns from Wagner, Coburn, and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as the snatched lad, with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by Wilfred Josephs, and top-notch cinematography by Frank Watts, with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal Ontario province.&#39;,
   &#39;Ok - I admit. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks, the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable, but reasonable plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting out, we\&#39;re introduced to the three lead females of the movie. One a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married. A police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about. The third - a power &amp; status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are almost the &#34;First Wives Club&#34;, and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex\&#39;s involved as well as some &#34;he left the credit card&#34; behaviour. Characters set - the movie continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McDowell\&#39;s character, the headmistress, arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist, filling in for the regular player (Doughty) catches her eye. What will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief? Will they live happily ever after?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tissue or two recommended if you\&#39;re the teary type - the end uplifting, but maybe not what you\&#39;d expect. All in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action, special effects and schlock horror.&#39;,
   &#34;One would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film (and I&#39;ve seen hundreds of Hindi and Bollywood movies, too). The actors, the beautiful settings, locations, and surroundings, the deep emotions portrayed, the sweet songs (especially the singing voice of Udit Narayan, my favorite) -- everything was just lovely. The human (imperfect) element was also woven in, to create some drama and drive the plot, as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution. Alok Nath is such a terrific actor, so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays, he almost steals the show from the young stars. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances -- ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love -- as one of the best films out there, Hindi or otherwise!&#34;,
   &#34;This is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of Lincoln(born 1809 Hodgensville-Kentucky- and died in Washington 1865). Ford&#39;s excellent movie takes Abraham Lincoln(Fonda) from his youth. He studied laws, common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837.This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his log-cabin days, initial relationship to Mary Todd(Weaver), following the couple from their first ball,and his departure for congress candidate. But focuses mainly on a brothers(Richard Cromwell,Eddie Quillan) accused for murder, the posterior trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum(Alice Brady). The Lincoln-Fonda as defender advocate and Donald Meek-prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent performance from Henry Fonda as idealistic,traveller Springfield solicitor , he was to star regularly for Ford from this movie, as ¨Grapes of wrath,My darling Clementine, and Fort Apache¨. Besides sterling acting by Alice Brady as grieved mother, she was a great actress from the silent cinema, but this one results to be her last movie because she early died from cancer.The Lincoln&#39;s deeds developing make for skilfully appealing entertaining.His portrayal shows a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and describes his goodness,uprightness and willful. Lincoln, like John Ford, was a straightforward man who never varied the ideals of his youth.This American masterpiece is correct on both counts, as splendid biography and as magnificent drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another biographies about Abraham Lincoln are the following: 1) ¨Abraham Lincoln¨(1930) by D.W.Griffith with Walter Huston, Una Merkel, talking from his birth until his assassination; 2) ¨Abe Lincoln in Illinois¨(1940)by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey, Ruth Gordon, concerning similar events to Ford&#39;s film through his career as lawyer 3)TV version titled ¨Gore Vidal&#39;s Lincoln¨ with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd.&#34;,
   &#39;I haven\&#39;t seen all of Jess Franco\&#39;s movies, I have seen 5, I think, and there are more than 180 of them. So maybe it\&#39;s a bit early to say so but &#34;Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden&#34; (better known as \&#39;Succubus\&#39;, but that is the cut version) is according to me if not the best, certainly on of Franco\&#39;s best. Franco is best known (although \&#39;known\&#39; might be slightly exaggerated) for &#34;Vampiros Lesbos&#34;, a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90\&#39;s when people found out Jess Franco was also an interesting composer. Through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of \&#39;The lion and the cucumber\&#39; (\&#39;Vampyros Lesbos OST\&#39;): Jess Franco is an overwhelming director. When the phone rang during \&#39;Vampiros\&#39;, I let it ring. I just wanted to see more of the movie. Since that moment Franco never could grip me that much. But then I stumbled on this movie. It is even better than &#34;Vampiros Lesbos&#34;, I think. Franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera. We find out he can do a lot. I certainly didn\&#39;t expect to find &#34;Necronomicon&#34; that great: its beginning didn\&#39;t impress me at all. Remember, I had seen &#34;Vampiros Lesbos&#34; before (although chronologically that came only three years later) and both movies kinda start the same. But then the story went on, puzzling and gripping, beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see Godard do if he weren\&#39;t so occupied with spreading his political messages. Later on in the movie I heard a dialogue about which art was or wasn\&#39;t old-fashioned. The man says that all movies have to be old-fashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed. But the girl replies that &#34;Bunuel, Fritz Lang and Godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow&#34;. Janine Reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course Howard Vernon, a Franco regular, is also there. Luckily the acting is good (something that can spoil a lot of Franco movies for you, but not this one). But certainly watch out for the dummy scene. The erotic tension, the wild directing and the fact that it\&#39;s a yesterday\&#39;s movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see. The fact that it is a bit more accessible than &#34;Vampiros Lesbos&#34; certainly helps.&#39;,
   &#39;In this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot. It is actually nice to watch because Singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships. This makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for. In fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap. Definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college movie.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a film i decided to go and see because I&#39;m a huge fan of adult animation. I quite often find that when a film doesn&#39;t evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is certainly more about style than story. While i found the story interesting (a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films), it was a bit hard to follow at times, and didn&#39;t feel like it all came together as well as it could have. It definitely had a mixed sense of French Animation and Japanese Anime coming together. Whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer. Visually this film is a treat for the eyes, and in that sense a work of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like adult animation, or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment. I would recommend it. All i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better&#34;,
   &#39;One thing i can say about this movie is well long, VERY LONG! I actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out. I was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because The 70\&#39;s (even though i never lived in them) is actually one of my favourite decades, especially for the music! when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive. i will admitt the animation did impress me! it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see. but the movie honestly could of been a bit better, it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting. then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly. in my opinion i thought it was EXTREMELY long. i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie, it made it seem like it was 4 hours long!!!! but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those &#34;nothing to do days&#34;. i will see the new one and i hope it is better!&#39;,
   &#34;This movie is a perfect portrayal of The Nutcracker; the dancing is wonderful, the scenery in the background was excellent, and I LOVED THAT FLOATING BED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the costumes... I particularly loved Marzipan&#39;s, the tutu was adorable. The special effects were very well done (e.g. the tree, the bed, etc.), and I quite enjoyed the rats. I love how they didn&#39;t make them scary, but cute and huggable. Except for the king, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a thoroughly masculine person, you won&#39;t enjoy this, but this is a very good movie that&#39;s good for all ages - just not all levels of testosterone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have a few complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, why did they have to put the Sugar Plum Fairy&#39;s partner in those terrible tights? It would barely make a difference if he was butt naked! And secondly.. why on EARTH did they have to make Culkin&#39;s outfit PINK?&#34;,
   &#34;I watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I didn&#39;t have the best time mainly because I didn&#39;t know about Ned Kelly or his story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since this is a biopic, it&#39;s important to at least know what to expect from the character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know if the manner the events are told are true, or if it everything is fictional. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but that&#39;s just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid Western-type movie for everybody&#39;s tastes. Heath Ledger is great as always and the sexy Naomi Watts charms the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. Otherwise, I don&#39;t think I could recommend it.&#34;,
   &#34;I can&#39;t really condemn the movie because it does work. There is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie, but I think it&#39;s only just in the category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s nothing sinister in this piece, and that&#39;s where the noir elements fail. Sure, the disease might be considered sinister, but I have a hard time seeing that. The movie hints at a darker side: Blackie may be trafficking human beings, the New Orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie... but those are really only hints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no attempt made to question Reed&#39;s motivations, as one with do with Marlowe or Spade, nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to Blackie, which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and direction are well done... but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over. Worth watching once, maybe twice if you don&#39;t remember it from years ago, and then putting away.&#34;,
   &#39;I have seen the trailer for this movie several times over, and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes away from it (it got my attention for sure). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom ,who is seen for a split second looks fantastic. I think that this movie will be a hit, and will be seen over and over again my many people.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I have ever seen. It does not seek to tell the whole story, but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. It is darkly witty, playful and seriously faithful to elements of the Jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation. Judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals, not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine, but a grossly mistaken man, horribly misguided in his zeal. Chris Saranden&#39;s Jesus is playful and serious, faithful and committed--very human while also divine. The final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity. I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.&#34;,
   &#39;Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore, \&#39;Not Only...But Also\&#39; saw his ex-\&#39;Beyond The Fringe\&#39; collaborator Peter Cook guest on the first show, and so well received was it the controller of B.B.C.-2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on. They were a classic comedy team - Cook was tall, handsome and witty, while Dudley was short, charismatic, and musically gifted. The sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub, wearing flat caps and mufflers, fantasising about movie stars such as Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time, and even when Cook corpses it still holds together well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those characters - idiot Pete and even-bigger idiot Dud - found their way into every episode of the show proper, seen in a different setting, such as a zoo or an art gallery. In the latter, they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art. &#34;That Leonardo DaVinci cartoon...I don\&#39;t see the joke!&#34;, says Dud. Pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits. Dud nearly chokes on his repast. &#34;You really are enjoying those sandwiches!&#34;, ad libs Cook. The pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold. The sketches themselves set new standards for comedy, standards that would not be matched until the arrival of \&#39;Monty Python\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the show\&#39;s popularity increased, so did the quality of the guest stars. Peter Sellers for instance, and John Lennon, the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem \&#39;Deaf Ted, Danoota, &amp; Me\&#39;. \&#39;One Leg Too Few\&#39; - had Dud as \&#39;George Spigott\&#39; ( a name later re-used in the film \&#39;Bedazzled\&#39; ), a one-legged man, who hops into the office of film producer Cook to audition for the role of \&#39;Tarzan\&#39;. Cook tries to let him down as best as he can. &#34;I\&#39;ve nothing against your right leg!&#34;, he says. &#34;The trouble is - neither have you!&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dud would on occasion interview the eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling ( Cook ), who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater, was planning on opening a restaurant called \&#39;The Frog &amp; The Peach\&#39;. Another classic was \&#39;The Leaping Nuns\&#39; ( also reused in \&#39;Bedazzled\&#39; ). But my all-time favourite has to be \&#39;Superthunderstingcar\&#39;, a wickedly funny ( and accurate ) parody of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson\&#39;s \&#39;Thunderbirds\&#39;. Pete and Dud played all the roles, with the latter making a fetching \&#39;Lady Penelope\&#39;. \&#39;Ludwig\&#39; had Ludwig Van Beethoven as the star of a \&#39;This Is Tom Jones\&#39; style variety show. \&#39;The Immortal Bargo\&#39; was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star \&#39;Emma Bargo\&#39;. In an unforgettable moment, she drove through London, bellowing through a loudhailer: &#34;I want to be alone!&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Season 3 feature was \&#39;Poets Cornered\&#39; with the likes of Ronnie Barker, Spike Milligan, Barry Humphries, Willie Rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank. They each had to improvise the line of a poem, and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three seasons were made in all, produced ( at different times ) by Joe McGrath, Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Sadly very few editions survive. To make matters worse, the scripts were destroyed as well. It beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show ended in 1970. The comics then hit Broadway, made the infamous \&#39;Derek &amp; Clive\&#39; tapes, but Cook\&#39;s ever-increasing alcoholism broke them apart. Eight years later, Cook announced that a new series was in the offing, but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part. His ex-partner was making films in America, and had no intention of working with Cook again ( not at that time anyway ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough footage was scraped together for a season of B.B.C.-2 repeats in the early \&#39;90\&#39;s. As expected, some items had not held up as well as others. Cook died in 1995, and by way of a tribute the B.B.C put together a programme compiled from various \&#39;Parkinson\&#39; interviews and \&#39;Not Only...But Also\&#39; shows. It ended rather appropriately with Pete and Dud finding themselves in Heaven. &#34;Bloody Hell!&#34;, exclaimed the latter. Moore passed on in 2002.&#39;,
   &#39;My school\&#39;s drama club will be putting this show in the spring of 2002, and I can only hope we\&#39;re as good as this! I watched this film recently as sort of &#34;research&#34; for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I\&#39;d just like to say, Vanessa Williams is the coolest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! The casting for this movie was right-on (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my gawd, is there anything he can\&#39;t do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson ever - I especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during &#34;Put on a Happy Face!&#34; He is so great! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the coolest. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable. Tyne Daly was hilarious as Albert\&#39;s obnoxious mother and George Wendt was superb as the annoyed Mr. McAfee (however I LOVED Paul Lynde\&#39;s performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau cracked me up as Ursula Merkle; she really hammed it up! And Marc Kudisch was an awesome Conrad Birdie...&#34;Suffer!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was only one casting that I didn\&#39;t understand, and, as you\&#39;ll see from previous comments, many other people didn\&#39;t understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was that? I mean she\&#39;s really pretty and very talented, but...she looks a bit too old for the role. Eh, maybe I\&#39;m delusional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay well anyways, I highly recommend this movie. It\&#39;ll leave you smiling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;Ruth Gordon at her best. This episode is my favorite of the whole Columbo series. Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon worked so well together that they should both be inducted into the television hall of fame, regardless of the rest of their work. Even the music was outstanding in this episode.&#39;,
   &#39;Misfits at a military school? Hmmmm, sounds funny, maybe offensive to some. You have the characters there, the Arab thief, the sex crazy teen, the smart mouth, the pot smoker, and not to forget, the guy who burns things. Throw in a strict no nonsense Sergent, a homosexual Sergent and one sexy ammunition teacher and it makes one crazy film adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this film and it is funny, because the comedy is revolved around the fact that if you try to work together, things get done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These band of misfit students at Weinberg Military school have been placed in here because, as Sgt Liceman quotes &#34;because you are outcasts, embarrassments to your families and communities, disgraces.&#34; One of Ralph Macchio\&#39;s earlier performances before the Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny, with appearances from Barbara Bach as well, this film appeals to teens and young adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great soundtrack keeps the film moving.&#39;,
   &#34;What starts out as generational conflict in this movie, ends in understanding, solemnity and grace. The movie meanders through Europe with the father and the young son cramped in a car over 3000 miles. The cramping forces lifestyles, beliefs and life skills to collide. There&#39;s really no clear winner. It all adds up in the end as experience, experience of multiple layers of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this movie offers a generous and gentle outlook, without being pushy about the agenda. It&#39;s a coming of age story for the young son, his dismissive and rebellious nature turning to openness for receiving more ways of life.&#34;,
   &#39;An enjoyable Batman animated film. Not on par with &#34;Return of the Joker&#34; or &#34;Mask of the Phantasm&#34;, but solid nonetheless. I liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who Batwoman was. There was nice twist. Nice action sequences. I\&#39;ve always been of the opinion that the Batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful Batman live action film sequels. The trend continues here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.5 out of 10&#39;,
   &#34;I couldn&#39;t help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was. The screenplay is highly intelligent and it just seemed that it could have been opened up in a way more reminiscent of Seven. Not by changing the story - I think mainly through the cinematography. The cinematography was the only thing that I found to be holding back the film. On the other hand, the pacing was absolutely on point. Whoever worked on the editing really did their job well. And I thought Bill Paxton did a great job of directing. Now away from the technical stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie threw me for a loop. SPOILER AHEAD!!!! All along, I really felt that Bill Paxton was crazy and then when Adam finally took the FBI agent to the Rose Garden to show him where the bodies were buried and revealed who he was, I got thrown for a loop. I had suspected the first part of the twist but what really threw me was when he touches the agent and sees the agent murder his mother and the fact that the agent too (without any words spoken, simply by touch) sees it again with Adam and asks him how he knew. My dilemma was not that it was yet another twist thrown in but the almost ungraspable idea that this man and his father were not crazy but actually picked out &#39;bad guys&#39; so to speak, knowing their sins and crimes already. I don&#39;t endorse an eye for an eye so I didn&#39;t leave the film being able to believe that they were doing God&#39;s work. Instead I chose to believe that they were both clairvoyant and that the father had gone off the deep end one day from it and through the things that he subjected his sons to, disturbed them permanently also. That was my interpretation but the vexing thing about the film was it&#39;s like a house of cards and a never-ending circle and what is the correct interpretation of the disturbing events you&#39;ve sat through. It&#39;s definitely one of those movies where I&#39;d love to be able to meet the writer so I could just ask him what the real meaning was to it all. Were they crazy and psychotic? Were they simply telepathic and took license because of it? Or did they have some sort of appearance from God? And if so, was it God or the Devil disguising himself as God. My friends and I found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A definitely perplexing and thought invoking film with some very disturbing but certainly not sensationalistic elements to it. It&#39;s not a perfect film, but it definitely is it&#39;s own thing. Great directorial work and acting by Bill Paxton and the child that played Fenton was extremely good. I hope he doesn&#39;t end up relegated to the child actor syndrome as he seems to have a lot of promise. I gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the components that make a film, but I would have voted higher if wasn&#39;t for the feeling that something (although I can&#39;t pinpoint what) was off and if it hadn&#39;t have been, the movie would have gone to an even higher level. Still, a definite recommend, especially for those that are inquisitive.&#34;,
   &#34;Not wishing to give *anything* away here, I would just say this technically excellent, flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half&#39;s entertainment: It will amuse, surprise, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way. Most definitely recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A previous User&#39;s Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter&#39;s outstanding performances - I agree entirely....&#34;,
   &#39;Purple Rain is so cool for the dad. We Are Tracking 921 callers from Minneapolis. Hudson Horstachio prepares to ride a motorcycle , take a ride with Franklin Fizzlybear in the caddy. Let\&#39;s go back to 1984 , it was a movie released and Prince tripped into stardom. You would think Hudson Horstachio will be a superstar for his new movie in 20th Century Fox Movie called &#34;VP : Purple Rain&#34; , starring Hudson Horstachio (voiced by Dan Green , who played Max\&#39;s Dad , the Pokemon gym leader). 9 Tracks. Tina Turner\&#39;s Private Dancer and Billy Ocean\&#39;s Suddenly was headed for the album as Prince held more concerts. It is time we\&#39;ve pulled the plug on the 1984 movies. Our 20th Century Fox Fans are not watching anymore. The Kid yells out &#34;Look Out For The Deer!&#34; is such a danger in mind , Ralph Schuckett will be composing and conducting the new movie called &#34;VP : Purple Rain&#34; released on video. Tom Cruise jumps into his motorcycle , Brad Pitt jumps into his motorcycle and Hudson Horstachio jumps into his motorcycle. Thanks to Bette Midler from Beaches and the keyboardists. You Are Beholding The Heroic Horstachio , Hudson! Bart is writing &#34;I shall not watch Purple Rain&#34; on the chalkboard , Go On The Bloomington Ferry Bridge and enjoy The Kid\&#39;s festivities. Hudson Horstachio is watching you!&#39;,
   &#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I have to say is that I own Jake Speed. I&#39;ve seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family has heard nothing. Along comes Jake Speed (Wayne Crawford), telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her. Jake Speed is a hero. He doesn&#39;t work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him around and writes their adventures into novels. This film is a great adventure. It&#39;s hilarious, it&#39;s action-packed, it&#39;s just great. I guess it&#39;s a cult film with a very small cult following. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed and throws out some one-liners that you&#39;ll never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick, respectively. John Hurt, the guy who&#39;s stomach blew up in Alien, plays the devilish, pervertish villian which just adds to the fun. In many ways, this film is similar to Indiana Jones, in some ways it&#39;s similar to James Bond films. Maybe it should have been called Indiana Bond but whatever it&#39;s title is, it&#39;s a very enjoyable film.&#34;,
   &#34;I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I have been able to see in quite some time. The animation is stunning. The artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful. From the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry. I was amazed. Moving beyond the beauty on the screen, you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh. Character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand. I&#39;m impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family.&#34;,
   &#34;Six Degrees is a wonderful show! I watched the entire season online since I just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2 :&#39;( and to top it all off, ABC has now taken it off-line, so it is unable to be viewed online anymore. Why would ABC create such a wonderful show, with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever completing the tale. It seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters. Honestly though I feel that ABC could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality TV shows. Six Degrees we will miss you.&#34;,
   &#39;From the very beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is possibly the funniest I\&#39;ve ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm this September.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every element came together in this movie so beautifully. It\&#39;s not often you see a movie with so many penis, gay, and racial jokes so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally. Carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you\&#39;re rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid. The supporting cast is brutal, each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we\&#39;re given. This is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. This movie will often be brought up when the words &#34;chest waxing&#34; and &#34;condoms&#34; are mentioned in conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching it in the theater I was surprised how many older people were there to watch it. I saw a group of four mid-60s women come in. Despite an older audience, this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the Office and Steve Carell. A lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you\&#39;d see on Family Guy, too. The movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t recommend going to this movie if you aren\&#39;t a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. However, when you are at the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes aren\&#39;t &#34;gay jokes,&#34; they\&#39;re just jokes. And they\&#39;re funny.&#39;,
   &#34;OK. Who brought the cheese. I love it. During it&#39;s run it became a phenomenon. The Anorexic Twins became popular.Bob Saget started making a paycheck (Instead of his REALLY funny stand-up). And people knew who Dave Coulier was. This is when life was good and simple. This is one of the great American classics. It was humorous and always brought home a good lesson. And this is where I differ from the norm: I liked the last few seasons. Like Home Improvement, when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script. This is why I dare say...It could have gone much later than it did. But anyway. I gave it an 8/10 because of its wholesome, funny story lines, and because of Bob Saget!&#34;,
   &#39;No, I\&#39;m not joking around. If you ever, EVER, have the chance to see this movie see it. If you need chop off your arm to see it, see it. It\&#39;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatty Drives The Bus is unlike any film you\&#39;ve ever seen. It takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art. While it contains poor shots, idiotic characters, bad dialogue, strange acting, and cinematography that belongs on public access in Iowa, it actually succeeds in its goal as a film. It strives to be the dumbest, strangest, most inane movie you\&#39;ve ever seen. And boy does it ever succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will lay out the plot for those of you who worry about such things (the filmmakers obviously didn\&#39;t), but really you needn\&#39;t pay too much attention because the entire film\&#39;s plot is presented in a very long piece of text played before the opening credits. In any event, FDTB (as its admirers call it) is the story of a bus tour through Chicago, which is led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in town, and all the passengers on the bus are supposed to die, and all their souls would have gone to hell, except with Jesus in town, a lackey in hell calls off the job, and this angers Satan because, well he doesn\&#39;t like looking like a fool in front of the guy, so he decides to get the people on the bus to sign over their souls to him directly, but he\&#39;s a devil, so he needs to disguise himself, otherwise, who\&#39;d go on a tour with him right, so he disguises himself as Roger and he gets on the bus, where the driver is never referred to by name, but he is kind of fat, so I guess he\&#39;s Fatty. The bus (and the riders) are on a collision course with wackiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examples of some lunacy: The title repeats on the screen 3 times. I don\&#39;t know why. A character appears on the bus in mid-trip without explanation or introduction, and occassionally sits next to the others, and they look at her like she doesn\&#39;t belong. I don\&#39;t know why. Two characters fall in love and exchange longing glances, that are really the same shots repeated over and over again. I don\&#39;t know why. After Satan gives a minute long monologue about transforming into human form a title card flashes &#34;Satan is going to transform.&#34; I don\&#39;t know why. One character is a woman who is very obviously a man in drag, and is referred to by other characters as &#34;the glamorous Bridget.&#34; I don\&#39;t know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was one good thing that came out of my internship at Troma last summer it was getting my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.&#39;,
   &#39;This short was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it had won! Basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood quite often embraced Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is a rare look on film at an improvisational jam. This has been added to the Film Preservation list and deservedly so. TCM runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its\&#39; &#34;31 Days of Oscar&#34; tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, swish, nothing but net and the shot\&#39;s so smooth, the net barely moved. Most solidly and highly recommended!!!&#39;,
   &#34;I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon.The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. It really caught pace after the first half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it&#39;s the ensemble, they just play so well together. I can watch this film anytime.I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. The jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Rock \&#39;n\&#39; Roll High School&#34; will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick. Portraying a bunch of high school students using the Ramones\&#39; music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal (Mary Woronov, of &#34;Eating Raoul&#34; fame), the whole movie is a mile a minute. It\&#39;s basically a big excuse to have fun, and I\&#39;m sure that you will. Bullied freshmen? Check. A dorky music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from &#34;Eating Raoul&#34;*)? Check. Exploding mice? Checkmate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living. Even for someone like me who doesn\&#39;t know the Ramones\&#39; music, it\&#39;s pure pleasure. With Roger Corman executive producing and Joe Dante co-directing, how could we expect anything less? Too bad that director Allan Arkush later degenerated into fare such as &#34;Caddyshack II&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also starring P.J. Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who has appeared in every one of Joe Dante\&#39;s movies, and many of Roger Corman\&#39;s), Don Steele, and of course the Ramones. A real treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It seems like Bartel and Woronov always co-starred. They also co-starred in Joe Dante\&#39;s &#34;Hollywood Boulevard&#34; and the slasher flick &#34;Chopping Mall&#34; (also starring Dick Miller)...in which they reprised their roles from &#34;Eating Raoul&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;A young solicitor from London, Arthur Kidd is sent to a small coastal town of Crythin Gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow Mrs Drablow. While attending her funeral, a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention. Supposedly Drablow lived a reclusive life, and locals kept pretty quiet about her. After this he heads to Mrs Drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide. There he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house, and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes. Now can Mrs Drablow\&#39;s belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help Kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and I can see their point. But only in doses does it draw upon tag. Yes, from what you can gather I was left a \&#39;little\&#39; under-whelmed, despite really liking it. I was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature, but that\&#39;s probably it\x85 expecting. Mainly I had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller \&#39;The Changeling\&#39;. When you hear so many good things, it\&#39;s sometimes hard not get caught up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow what the British TV presentation of &#34;The Woman in Black&#34; effectively does is bring out a truly old-fashion, slow burn spine-tingling premise driven by its moody locations, disquieting atmosphere and first-rate performances. Subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story (adapted off Susan Hill\&#39;s novel of the same name), as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist. Little seems to happen, and can feel drawn out, but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard. Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black. Who mostly appears as a background figure, it\&#39;s ultimately creepy. She might not appear all that much, but when she does\x85. Talk about unnerving! That also goes for that downbeat conclusion. Pauline Moran, who plays the woman in black, competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning. A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you. She\&#39;s a spirit you don\&#39;t want to cross paths with, yet alone let her see you. An accomplished performance by a marvelously moody Adrian Rawlins as the solicitor Arthur Kidd does hold it all together. In support are solid turns by Bernard Hepton, David Daker, Clare Holman and David Ryall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn, time-worn Victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear. Director Herbert Wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well-judged contriving. Instead of going out to shock us, some scenes contain a distressing intensity that won\&#39;t let go. The sound effects are masterfully used, by surrounding and disorienting the air. Rachel Portman\&#39;s harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rarity made-for-television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook-fest. It might not share much new to the sub-genre, but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse.&#39;,
   &#39;Cute idea... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a teeny tiny little county of Lampidorra. That country, which wasn\&#39;t even in North America, was made the 49th state... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was made in 1952...) Linda travels to the country she has inherited, and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people. At one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people the Navajo, and it gets ever-more sillier from there.... although Yolande Donlan\&#39;s heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared. There are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of technicolor, or some such equivalent, about the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as British subject Tony Craig, cheese vendor. Bogarde made a big splash in the UK film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and &#34;the new princess&#34; keep bumping into each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as Lampidorra\&#39;s financial problems worsen... Fun little farce....along the lines of Marx Brothers film. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our little project, and stayed married for 50 years! Guest was better known for writing and directing his sci-fi flicks, in both the UK &amp; the US.&#39;,
   &#34;This film is NOT about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment. Its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one. The cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time, hence the name &#39;fraidy cat&#39;. Fraidy Cat&#39;s previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different era&#39;s in time and are constantly trying to kill him off, but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts. very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i watched this movie almost every day as a child :o)&#34;,
   &#34;The obvious parallels between Walt Disney&#39;s charming fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia are pretty apparent. There are more coincidences here than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than with Mary Poppins even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two Disney films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like The Chronicles of Narnia it involves some English children leaving London during the blitz and coming to live in the country. And those kids have to deal with a world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis the Rawlins kids have the magic invade their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now. No retreating to a fantasy kingdom like the Pevensie kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No heavy duty philosophy here from Walt Disney except maybe it&#39;s not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like Angela Lansbury who learn their magic from a charlatan like David Tomlinson. Ms. Lansbury didn&#39;t get to be one of the most bankable of performers for nothing. She carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at Disney couldn&#39;t top. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two performers made their farewell to films in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O&#39;Shea played her last role in this film, she graced many a film in the United Kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers. And that grand character actor Reginald Owen as the retired general who leads the Old Home Guard in war and in song bids adieu to film audiences around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote a good and serviceable one here. The Age Of Not Believing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the Theme from Shaft. Personally though I do like David Tomlinson&#39;s tribute to that most colorful of London streets, Portabello Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years. Imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is directed by Renny Harlin the finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and Mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to direct actionmovie. Stallone needed this role to get back on track. Snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow, ice, cold and bad weather than finnish man. Action is good! Music in the film is spectacular. The bad guy is John Litghow, other stars Micheal Rooker ( The portrait of serialkiller), Janine Turner ( Strong Medicine). The is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie. Overall good movie ****/*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Extreme ääliöt: special collectors edition, with good extras. Comig soon in Finland straight to video.&#39;,
   &#39;Watching &#34;The Fox and the Child&#34; was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals, integrity of point of view, and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is uncomplicated. Deceptively simple. Within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laughed. I wept. I learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a movie you can trust yourself to -- give yourself over to. Dare I say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. It reaches to the heart of the viewer--of any age--and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in Reality. I feel I have been privileged to watch--no, to participate in--this film, a work of true Art.&#39;,
   &#34;I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this as my #3 film. I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It&#39;s nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a very good film and I&#39;m sure a very hard film to pull together with it&#39;s large ensemble cast but Director Kay Pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and I would look forward to more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded cast. I would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie had me smiling from beginning to end, partly at the humor, partly at Meg Ryan (this is the perfect character for her), and always because it&#39;s just one of the best feel-good movies I&#39;ve seen. Hopefully the DVD will be out soon.&#34;,
   &#39;The second alternate Gundam universe tale (G-Gundam being the first), Gundam Wing is yet another different view into the Gundam verse. The familiar elements are found but Gundam Wing is actually different then its counterparts. The biggest being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization. In truth, the series doesn\&#39;t really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict, the Eve Wars, don\&#39;t happen until the later episodes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest positives of this series are it\&#39;s characters. All the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in. Another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. The designs put some of it\&#39;s other Gundam counterparts to shame. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard UC fans claim rip off of the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more apparent UC clone of Gundam Seed is out there is beyond me. True there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take for example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs is more the outcast in the Alliance and in ways OZ as well, while the Red Comet was shining symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is the fact Zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he\&#39;s given in the early episodes: &#34;Killer of his own men.&#34; Char isn\&#39;t given this label. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems with this series isn\&#39;t the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems. The first is the reused animation footage of the Gundams attacks. Sure it\&#39;s fun seeing Heavy Arms attack tanks, MS, and planes the first time. But on it\&#39;s fourth re-use scenes like this do get old. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year. If you really think about all the events springing in the series, a lot happens in just one lone year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro\&#39;s first lines every so often. As it ranks, this is probably the best of the Alternate universe Gundam tales and a great introduction into the Gundam world. After all, this was the very first Gundam anime to air in the US television.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie is an incredible piece of work. It explores every nook and cranny of the human mind, focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them. Stellar performances all around. This one had me weeping for about half an hour straight. Spend some real time with this one.&#39;,
   &#34;I went into Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while that&#39;s something like what this film is; I also can&#39;t help but think that it&#39;s just a poor man&#39;s Sleuth. The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot, but certainly it&#39;s the case with the execution. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary&#39;s Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his latest play bombs, Sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, arrives on his doorstep. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe, killing him, and then passing Deathtrap off as his own work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all of its clever twists and turns; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element, and that&#39;s the characters. The film fails to provide a single likable character, and it&#39;s very hard to care about the story when you&#39;re not rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by the acting. Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but nobody else does themselves proud. Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance. It&#39;s lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film. The plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others, but there&#39;s always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in its own right, and the cinematography fits the film well. Overall, I have to admit that I did enjoy this film; but it could have been much, much better.&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this movie at the theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it then, and have recently come to own a VHS version. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed watching it again too. Though I have to admit it is not as good on a little TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have older children so I do not know what they would think of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs are very cute. My daughter keeps singing them over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.&#39;,
   &#39;When I saw the Dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like gory scenes as the Dentist has lots of gory scenes. That\&#39;s why it has it\&#39;s R18 rating. It\&#39;s about a beverly hills dentist Dr Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke cheating on him with the poolman. It\&#39;s best to go to your dentist &#34;before&#34; you watch this. But if you don\&#39;t like going to the dentist already, then it\&#39;s best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life. the Dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that I\&#39;ve ever seen. Who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist (Spoiler) pull out all his cheating wife\&#39;s teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic? Overall awesome flick, but not for everyone.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie isn&#39;t as bad as I heard. It was enjoyable, funny and I love that is revolves around the holiday season. It totally has me in the mood to Christmas shop and listen to holiday music. When this movie comes out on DVD it will take the place of Christmas Vacation in my collection. It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year. I heard that Ben&#39;s character was a bit crazy but I think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time. Take it for what is it, a Christmas comedy with a love twist. I enjoyed it. No, it isn&#39;t Titanic and it won&#39;t make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two. So go laugh and have a good time:)&#34;,
   &#39;Watching &#34;Ossessione&#34; today -- more than 6 decades later -- is still a powerful experience, especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how Italian filmmakers changed movies forever (roughly from &#34;Ossessione&#34; and De Sica\&#39;s &#34;I Bambini Ci Guardano&#34;, both 1943, up to 20 years later with Fellini, Antonioni, Pasolini). Visconti makes an amazing directing début, taking the (uncredited) plot of &#34;The Postman Always Rings Twice&#34; as a guide to the development of his own themes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It strikes us even today how ahead of its time &#34;Ossessione&#34; was. Shot in Fascist Italy during World War II (think about it!!), it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters -- and the fact that it used the plot of a famous American novel and payed no copyright didn\&#39;t help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Ossessione&#34; alarmingly reveals poverty-ridden war-time Italy (far from the idealized Italy depicted in Fascist &#34;Telefoni Bianchi&#34; movies); but it\&#39;s also extremely daring in its sexual frankness, with shirtless hunk Gino (Massimo Girotti, who definitely precedes Brando\&#39;s Kowalski in &#34;A Streetcar Named Desire&#34;) taking Giovanna (Clara Calamai), a married woman, to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet. We watch Calamai\&#39;s unglamorous, matter-of-fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between Gino and Lo Spagnolo (Elio Marcuzzo - a very appealing actor, his face not unlike Pierre Clémenti\&#39;s, who was shot by the Nazis in 1945, at 28 years old!)...In a few words: sex, lust, greed and poverty, as relentlessly as it had rarely, if ever, been shown before in Italian cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the copies of &#34;Ossessione&#34; were destroyed soon after its opening -- it was called scandalous and immoral. Visconti managed to save a print, and when the film was re-released after the war, most critics called it the front-runner of the Neo-Realist movement, preceding Rossellini\&#39;s &#34;Roma CIttà Aperta&#34; and De Sica\&#39;s &#34;Sciuscià&#34;. Some other critics, perhaps more appropriately, saw &#34;Ossessione&#34; as the Italian counterpart to the &#34;poetic realism&#34; of French cinema (remember Visconti had been Renoir\&#39;s assistant), especially Marcel Carné\&#39;s &#34;Quai des Brumes&#34; and &#34;Le Jour se Lève&#34;, and Julien Duvivier\&#39;s &#34;Pépé le Moko&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While &#34;Ossessione&#34; may be Neo-Realistic in its visual language (the depiction of war-time paesan life in Italy with its popular fairs, poverty, child labor, prostitution, bums, swindlers etc), the characters and the themes were already decidedly Viscontian. He was always more interested in tragic, passionate, obsessive, greedy characters, in social/political/sexual apartheid, in the decadence of the elites than in realistic, &#34;everyday- life&#34; characters and themes, favored by DeSica and Rossellini. In &#34;Ossessione&#34; we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films, especially &#34;Senso&#34; (Visconti\&#39;s definitive departure from Neo-Realist aesthetics) and &#34;Rocco e Suoi Fratelli&#34;...Even in his most &#34;Neo-Realist&#34; film, &#34;La Terra Trema&#34;, he makes his fishermen rise from day-to-day characters to mythological figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Ossessione&#34; is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches, analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again, from their first to their last opus, no matter if the scenery, background or time-setting may change -- Visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are, well, obsessively recurrent. &#34;Ossessione&#34; is not to be missed: you\&#39;ll surely be fascinated by this ground-breaking, powerful film.&#39;,
   &#34;The movie actually has a fairly good story, but gets bogged down in several key places. It&#39;s almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a fairly decent job in his role... but something is clearly missing from several key scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 2.5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie. And probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#34;I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, I&#39;ve been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he&#39;ll crack an Oscar one day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s not to denigrate this film at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a fine story, with very believable people (well, it&#39;s based upon the author&#39;s early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast \x96 Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list \x96 with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster! What fun it was...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#39;t achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But, that&#39;s what you find out when you see this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#39;s a basic family movie, but that&#39;s a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you&#39;ll all have a lot of good laughs.&#34;,
   &#39;This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon. The &#34;sisters&#34; in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a Muslim council. It is rather long -- about two hours -- but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges. It will leave you, as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred. How and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the Cameroon? Have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses? Was the granting of a divorce by a Muslim court, against the express wishes of the husband, a one time event? I\&#39;m not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions. They made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And the movie they made deserves a wide audience.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie is just funny. mindless, but funny. to enjoy this movie completely you can\&#39;t have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film. I still find the bit at the start funny when he says &#34;want a beer........cock&#34;. funny stuff. but what makes the film decent is the fact that it doesn\&#39;t try to hard to create a serious spin on the film, too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just don\&#39;t believe. But this is different and just focuses on being funny. I must say though, Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guys, coop, remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch&#39;,
   &#39;This movie should not be compared to &#34;The Sting&#34;, or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It\&#39;s also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly, hugely recommended!&#39;,
   &#39;Our Song is a marvelous example of passionate, movie making at its aesthetic best. It is, in fact, a genuine wonder of a movie; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult, life altering choices that will likely re-define who each of them is, as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim McKay\&#39;s writing/direction is graceful and uncluttered. There is no sappy, gratuitous sentimentality nor are there cliché ridden solutions in this film. What we see here seems, at times, to be heart breakingly real. There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you will - in Our Song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of the credit for the film\&#39;s spirit goes to its principle actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha), and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is dazzlingly powerful. It would be easy - and, of course, blatantly obtuse - to dismiss, as some apparently have, the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional. In fact, their quiet charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, are absolutely riveting. One would have to be completely &#34;out of touch&#34; with, or completely indifferent to, the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Likewise, the supporting cast, particularly Marlene Forte as Lanisha\&#39;s mother, compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age.&#39;,
   &#39;Greetings again from the darkness. Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the harshness of animals that live in the wilderness. For anyone over 40, Disney and Mutual of Omaha\&#39;s Wild Kingdom provided much of our insight into wild animals since our childhood ... back when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What always fascinates is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. Watching the elephants trudge for days, nearly delirious from lack of water, is oh so painful. But their nighttime battle against the lions is thrilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the underwater shots are breathless. The mama and baby humpbacks are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack its prey is every bit as chilling as &#34;Jaws&#34;. The most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the Himalayas. I had never seen such detail of the vastness of the range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t think most young kids today will be too excited by this one, but it surely is one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries I have ever seen.&#39;,
   &#39;This very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time. With its tumultuous emotions and net of visions, dreams, and startling images, its effect is both beautiful and unsettling. The actors are choreographed more like dance than acting. It contains the only dream sequence I know of that actually resembles a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;ve just returned from a showing of &#34;My Left Foot&#34; at our public library. What an emotional experience -- I feel drained and uplifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s the story of Christy Brown, Irish writer and painter, and based on the author\&#39;s autobiographical &#34;My Left Foot.&#34; Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy such that the only limb he had good control of was his left foot. Doctors advised his parents he was hopelessly mentally retarded but his mother didn\&#39;t give up on him and, somewhat as Annie Sullivan had done with Helen Keller, helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then to read, write, and paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film won Academy Awards for Daniel Day-Lewis (best actor) as well as best supporting actress for the actress playing his mother; it also received Oscar nominations for best picture, best director, and best adapted screenplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many films may entertain me, many also often leave me having to overlook gross fictions or improbabilities in realistic psychological reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this film--it was absolutely &#34;spot on&#34; in portraying typical Irish parental roles &amp; behaviors (see, e.g., see typical Irish families in McGoldrick\&#39;s &#34;Ethnicity &amp; Family Therapy&#34;) as well Christy Brown\&#39;s uneven emotional maturation--some immature personality reactions that were even further amplified by his picking up traits of his father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film presents the greater truth while changing certain sequences in his development (painting &amp; writing) and condensing several important people into one person, for the sake of telling a coherent, believable story, not burdened by small, distracting, less important actualities. (See Christy Brown in Wikipedia for more accuracy.) The DVD version we were shown had some English subtitles that were a great help in understanding Christy\&#39;s speech (&amp; some of the Irish speech); the initial release of the film may have lacked this. (If you see this on DVD, enable that option.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest, believable acting jobs I\&#39;ve ever seen. Truly magnificent, outstanding, superlative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;My Left Foot&#34; bears more than some similarity to a more recent film, &#34;The Diving Bell &amp; the Butterfly,&#34; in that each portrays the life of a real person successfully surmounting the imprisonment and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in doing so, it resonates with William Ernest Henley\&#39;s &#34;Invictus&#34; which begins: &#34;Out of the night that covers me,//Black as the Pit from pole to pole,//I thank whatever gods may be//For my unconquerable soul.&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;Extremely interesting and intriguing movie. The similarities to David Lynch (who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the house keeper in this film is called Mrs. Grubach, as is the one in Der Prozess...) are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of Belgium in Africa. The exact content of the movie I can not clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well, and his quest for social contact and love. These are the symbolic themes I deduced from the movie, but in fact they&#39;re no more than impressions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery (beautiful close ups of beatles, larvas and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style). Maybe you can say that I didn&#39;t quite &#39;get&#39; the film, but I have been watching like hypnothised for 1.5 hour, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity.&#34;,
   &#39;I think that this is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen. Robert Harling\&#39;s script is near perfect, just check out the &#34;quotes&#34; section; on second thought, just rent the DVD, since it\&#39;s the delivery that really makes the lines sing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Field gives a comic, over-the-top performance like you\&#39;ve never seen from her anywhere else, and Kevin Kline is effortlessly hilarious. Robert Downey, Jr. is typically brilliant, and in a very small role, Kathy Najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer. I was never much of a fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she\&#39;s great here as the one *real* person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of &#34;The Sun Also Sets&#34; -- that rumbling you feel beneath you is Hemingway rolling over in his grave. Either that, or he\&#39;s laughing really hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars. Funny, funny, funny.&#39;,
   &#34;Simply, one of the funiest movies i&#39;ve ever seen. It&#39;s a parody of crime-life, parody of everything that represents the Chicago 1930.- There is no realy need to underestimate this movie because rating is under 5. Its a opinion of a mass, and mass is hypnotized. Who decide to watch it - it will regret, Who decide not to watch it - will regret more.&#34;,
   &#34;This is one irresistible great cheerful- and technically greatly made movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie features some of the greatest looking sets you&#39;ll ever see in a &#39;30&#39;s movie, even though it&#39;s all too obvious that they are sets, rather than real place locations. Often if a character would fall or shake a doorpost too aggressive, the entire set would obviously move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best moments of the movie were the silent, more old fashioned, slapstick kind of moments. It shows that René Clair&#39;s true heart was at silent movie-making. The overall humor is really great in this movie. Also of course the musical moments were more than great. This is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early French musical. Though the best moments are the silent moments, that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog, that gets very well delivered by the main actors, who all seemed like stage actors to me, which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant no-worries atmosphere. No wonder this worked out so well, since this movie is actually based on stage play by Georges Berr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a technical really great movie, with also some great innovation camera-work in it and some really great editing, that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences. There is never a dull moment in this movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;René Clair was such a clever director, who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies. It&#39;s a very creative made movie, that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie, that never seizes to entertain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last half hour is especially unforgettably fun, without spoiling too much, and is really among the greatest, as well as most creative moments in early comedy film-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters, who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks. It all adds to the pleasant light comical atmosphere and cuteness of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most pleasant movies you&#39;ll ever see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#34;,
   &#34;This is one of those feel good, Saturday afternoon movies. It&#39;s right up there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up. And it&#39;s fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally really like movies like this from time to time. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. And I would have never known Mr. Phoenix had I not recently read the credits. He was just a baby really when he made this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too. She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie. I agree it&#39;s not an Oscar caliber movie. But very much worth watching. Especially if you have kids in the , let&#39;s say, 8 to 11 year old range. Or ones that are interested in the space program.&#34;,
   &#39;Although Cameron Grant was clearly hired to replace Andrew Blake over at Ultimate Pictures when the latter started his own company (Studio A), he practically outdid the &#34;Master&#34; right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes. So, while all the window dressing Blake had pioneered (starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses, coiffed and made up as if they\&#39;re about to hit the catwalk) remained very much present and accounted for, Grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content. In doing so, he raised the heat to a level that had eluded Big A ever since his first \x96 and IMHO best \x96 film NIGHT TRIPS. Cam\&#39;s maiden effort, ELEMENTS OF DESIRE, might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the Blake aesthetic (with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes), but his subsequent DINNER PARTY already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories, with an extended orgy at the conclusion. Scrumptious Juli Ashton and Tammy Parks smear food stuff all over each other\&#39;s flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh. Busty Crystal Gold (here : &#34;Catalina&#34;) was rarely more than a reliable second-stringer, adding spice to several Ona Zee bargain basement noirs, yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with Fabio lookalike Vince Voyeur. Beautiful blondes Kylie Ireland and Yvonne, making out with Marc Davis (for the record, the latter two were an item at the time) under a waterfall, complete the eye candy section of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to get cooking ! Early Jenna Jameson (&#34;Daisy&#34; back then) foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains Frank Towers (&#34;Mark Slade&#34; on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry) of all vital juices, albeit with a little help from brunette Diva for effective contrast, the scene\&#39;s stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place. Impossibly hunky construction worker Gerry Pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down, a prospect too tantalizing for prim \&#39;n\&#39; proper business woman Asia Carrera (at her all time most achingly pretty) to pass up. Best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty Norma Jeane and handsome Sean Michaels teasing the pants off each other \x96 for starters ! \x96 while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sex that proves either artsy or hot, and more often than not both, Grant has concocted a veritable smörgåsbord of fleshy wares to continue the film\&#39;s gastronomic analogy the title implies. Couples may be the prime intended audience, but an alternation between naughty \&#39;n\&#39; nice should rightfully include that &#34;something for everything&#34; recipe so many adult features are aiming for. Acting as his own DoP, the director shows great eye for detail, like the shot of Asia Carrera\&#39;s pristine white shoes being spattered with mud, enriching his vision. This marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one, as was the case with Nick Steele who stepped up to take his place at Ultimate \x96 effectively making him a replacement\&#39;s replacement ? \x96 when he packed up for greener pastures.&#39;,
   &#34;I was initially forced to attend by my wife as she is fascinated by the Royal families of Britain and their history, and she won&#39;t go to the cinema without me. Although viewers shouldn&#39;t expect to be electrified, this film is very well made and the visual aspect is second to none. In many ways it helps dispel the myth that Victoria was the miserable unsmiling dumpy woman usually seen in photographs. She was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years, a fun loving happy young woman. Her love of Albert was the essence of true love, and even if you only count the number of children she bore (9), they must have had a passionate relationship. All of this is well borne out in the film. To this end, the cast has been well selected with both Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend giving sound performances as Victoria and Albert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(SPOILER ALERT) The historical accuracy is somewhat questionable as at no time did Prince Albert get shot while defending Victoria. There was at least one assassination attempt when they were out together, but nobody was struck by the shot/s. I also found it odd that little was done to expand on the allegedly intimate relationship between Victoria&#39;s mother and Sir John Conroy. It is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for Victoria&#39;s distaste for both her mother and Conroy. I also found it odd that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne as erring on the romantic, or at least having the potential to become romantic. He was already in his late 50&#39;s when Victoria came to the throne, and while marriages between older men and young women were common in that era, the movie portrays Melbourne as being a dashing 30 something and rival to Prince Albert. There were apparently rivals to Albert, but she could never have married even slightly below her station in life, and Albert was one of only a handful who would have been acceptable in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I have spent worse times at the cinema, and brownie points with my wife can&#39;t be a bad thing either.&#34;,
   &#39;I enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film. The story is simple. An older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children. The faces of the actors are marvelous to see. The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well. The operas in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and intricate. The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel. The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism, humanity, and history portrayed.&#39;,
   &#39;WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I\&#39;m not at all a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Usually I don\&#39;t like dramas. I am not a Will Smith super fan even thinking that he is a very good actor......but this movie ! It is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting...wow...it is stunning. This movie captured my attention minute by minute and I even did not like &#34;The pursuit of happiness&#34; (maybe also because i did not like the acting of Will\&#39;s son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors, I saw him also last night in &#34;The day the earth stood still&#34; and I confirmed my sensation that Jaden can\&#39;t act). I don\&#39;t want to write spoilers and so i don\&#39;t talk about the story but what I can say is that this movie talks about Love, Death and other feelings which i don\&#39;t like to watch in movies....but THIS MOVIE is such a super great movie. If you have a minimum of heart you\&#39;ll don\&#39;t regret watching it&#39;,
   &#34;Spielberg&#39;s first dramatic film is no let-down. It&#39;s a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an African-American woman. It also proves that not all movies that have the African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an African-American director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this movie is Spielberg&#39;s ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book. Furthermore, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually, he&#39;s just himself throughout most of his movies. But in this, he completely branches out and is someone else for once. But, the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She is excellent as Celie. You will never forget these characters once you&#39;ve seen this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well, and all I can say is: I hope it&#39;s about as good as this one is, because this one is a film that shouldn&#39;t be missed.&#34;,
   &#34;Tony Hawk Underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underground introduced the storymode, which was very cool because it made a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. Another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard, which is nice because now you can actually climb, run, and do all sorts of new things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The levels are good, Neversoft also improved on an issue that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs. The first two games for the PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits. In this version, they shortened those features, there isn&#39;t as many people wondering the streets, in fact there are almost none in some levels, and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This game does have one con, the storymode is a little short, of course this is Neversofts first time doing this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so that is understandable. However, with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.&#34;,
   &#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presenting Lily Mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok now that you know my bias, here are some reasons I think this movie does stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star, and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a pretty stock Hollywood story of the period, the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when the star quits, she isn&#39;t successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Judy Garland (enough said!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily&#39;s mother is truely wonderful, as is Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The standout supporting performance though goes to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, a one time actress turned theater custodian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a watch for sure. One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.&#34;,
   &#39;I\&#39;ve always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh\&#39;s versions of the Shakespeare classics, as he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one who lifts the whole movie, is none other than &#34;the-always-great-actor&#34; Laurence Fishburne. Surely he has made some poor choices in films, even though he\&#39;s a wonderful actor, but in this one we\&#39;re truly given the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with Fishburne\&#39;s well portrayed paranoia and, furthermore, we\&#39;re finally given a black Othello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that blend of sympathy/antipathy, love/hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes...? Branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, Iréne Jacob\&#39;s Desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, whilst Laurence Fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Do watch it.&#39;,
   &#39;This is a plain old spooky ghost story. I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club, and they were kept spellbound until the ending! No blood or gore- just good old fashioned suspense. It starts out right from the beginning, and builds and builds. The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well directed and well acted. It is also a &#34;period piece&#34;- set in the 1920s- which added to the atmosphere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon. The movie follows the book rather closely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a shame it\&#39;s not readily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with &#34;Haunted&#34; are probably two of the best Ghost Stories I\&#39;ve ever scene. Which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes &#34;in your face&#34; gore any day!&#39;,
   &#39;A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash Broadway play about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two &#34;colored&#34; sisters who lived past the age of 100. Wonderfully played in their old age by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, respectively, they tell their story in flashbacks to Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times reporter. The flashback and present-day scenes don\&#39;t have as much inspirational value in them as in the book, but really are powerful. However, certain aspects of the sisters\&#39; lives, such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their father\&#39;s stern personality are not presented clearly. You need to read the book to fully understand these things. Which is just as well, because the book\&#39;s just as great! Aside from those flaws, it\&#39;s wonderfully done and performed, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational movie.&#39;,
   &#39;I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought the VHS and have enjoyed it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot has been well-discussed, so no need in going over it again. The point is this movie deserves repeated viewings. Americans, especially, aren\&#39;t going to get all the jokes the first time around. I know I didn\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is funny, touching, sad-- all at the same time. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter\&#39;s wedding, it\&#39;s cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony &#34;Brian&#34; as he attempts to kiss her, it\&#39;s heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it\&#39;s too funny for words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the music: it\&#39;s as good as any movie soundtrack I\&#39;ve heard in years. I was dancing in the living room to &#34;All Over the World.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it. It\&#39;s a gem.&#39;,
   &#34;My father grew grew up watching George Reeves as Superman and when I was a little kid he had episodes on VHS and let me view them including this movie (passing them down in the family if you will), and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clark Kent and Lois Lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it&#39;s up to Superman to stop this mayhem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s just so wonderful and fun to view. The old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a little kid, and I&#39;m 16 now, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.&#34;,
   &#39;Now, for all of the cinematographical buffs out there, this film may not rank high on your list of things to see. But if you know anything about plot development, profound truth, and the intentions that this film (the series) had, you\&#39;d understand my p.o.v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, the specifics of the film are renderings of the writer, who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end. But the film is biblically accurate and justifiably &#34;scares&#34; viewers into thinking about what may be. I\&#39;m a Christian, not due to this movie, but due to my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed therein can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions. It\&#39;s not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, but rather, a means to get your attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Christian, I know I\&#39;ll not be left behind, and thanks to movies like this, I can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment, acting, and film budgeting to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer. This is a movie you shouldn\&#39;t not only see, but feel with your heart and soul.&#39;,
   &#34;The best Cheech &amp; Chong movie so far!! Of all the Cheech and Chong this is most certain the best so far. I think I&#39;ve seen them all about twelve times at least, and I love them all. But this is most definitely the best. Compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs. Part of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope that one day they can make another one, because they still are great comedians. I heard they are writing a new script so who knows... I guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever watched one of them...&#34;,
   &#34;This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven&#39;t come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one. This is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film. At first, the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves, even if grudgingly, through each other. Rogers&#39; heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and Sheedy&#39;s angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them. You will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it&#39;s in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread. Hopefully audiences will get to see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt.&#34;,
   &#34;I must admit I&#39;m a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to provoke. I think its a great horror/sci fi film. Colonel Steve West (Alex Rebar) returns to Earth after an historical space flight to Saturn. While in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease. He wakes up in a hospital bed, he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting! Escaping the hospitals supervision, he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town. Unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing hunger that can only be satisfied by eating other people. He must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive! Stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror! Its up to his old friend Dr Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning) to find him and try and help him. He has to work alone as his boss General Perry (Myron Healey) wants it kept ultra quiet. Nelson can&#39;t even tell his wife Judy (Ann Sweeny). However, Sheriff Blake (Micheal Alldredge) becomes suspicious as General Perry turns up just as some of the local townspeople start turning up half eaten. I don&#39;t really understand why this film gets such negative reviews, what do people expect? Anyway, I really like this film. The star of the film are unquestionably Rick Bakers Special Make-up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent, and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible CGI makes them even better. Writer and Director William Sachs isn&#39;t afraid to use them either, we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well, even now. Photography, music and direction are a little bit dull, but professional enough. The script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster, shots of him looking longingly into Ted Nelsons house, or when he sees his own reflection in some water and reacts violently. The ending, set in a large factory of some sort, is pretty downbeat so don&#39;t expect any happy ending. Which surprised me. Also, the script doesn&#39;t really do anything with the premise, he just walks around melting and killing, with his friend trying to stop him, maybe a bit too simple. Personally I think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion, her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too, it looks and sounds totally ridiculous! You need to see it to believe it! I like this film a lot and recommend it to 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s horror/sci fi fans. A bit of a favourite of mine.&#34;,
   &#34;I love this show. I watch all the reruns every day even though I have seen all of them like 6 time s each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. Holly goes to live with Val when their dad is transferred to Japan. Val has the perfect life, she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment of the Upper East Side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show basically shows all the problems Vall and Holly go through. the main problem is guys but also is about being responsible and other life choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly is 16 and is a total free spirit while Val is the complete opposite. She is the organized has to have a plan to do anything kind of person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren, and Tina.&#34;,
   &#39;Thre isn\&#39;t a single Scorsese movie I\&#39;d place on a list of my favorite movies. But this is the best thing I\&#39;ve run through my DVD player in about five years. Scorsese\&#39;s patient elucidation of favorite film moments, and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s 3 DVD-sides worth of material. It would have to be a British production, since everything about American corporate culture would have trampled the quiet, methodical, no frills, put-the-focus-on-the-content approach that is taken here. And an American production would have demanded he say he liked only movies that were popular favorites. I wish everyone took a page from his love of movies. You should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not just more &#34;Me-too&#34; votes for The Godfather, etc.. People have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If they did, movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese DOES know what ideas are being explored, and that makes him a compelling, involved speaker on the topic. I really appreciate his articulate, generous interviews over the last decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a negative note, Scorsese is best when he\&#39;s excited to show you some obscure movie, rather than when he\&#39;s didactically teaching you something well-established about film history. And I do wish he pluck those three hairs out of the bridge of his nose. It\&#39;s very distracting.&#39;,
   &#39;I saw this movie when I was a little girl. And I have enjoyed it every time. Sure the graphics are a little cheesy, compared to now, but back in the 70\&#39;s it was great. I saw it in the original Spanish version only and thought it was wonderful. That was how I remember my Christmases were with my family - magical. Santa Claus was amazing and I couldn\&#39;t wait for him to come back each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a child/children and speak Spanish, bring them up watching this old fashioned version of &#34;Santa Claus&#34;. It\&#39;s a different version than we are used to today, but who says there is one way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a fun movie to watch. It teaches children good vs. bad. I don\&#39;t know how the English subtitled version is or if there is an English one of this, but the Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Feliz Navidad!&#39;,
   &#39;Across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition, should take time out to see this film. The movie is called &#34; City Hall &#34; and with little imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just so happens to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. His right-hand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack) an equally bright individual who\&#39;s ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. Everything points in that direction, until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda) who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor. A six year old boy and a police officer\&#39;s death are blamed on a career criminal who\&#39;s questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political pay-offs and city corruption involving union leaders like Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also implicated, are party officials like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works for the probation office of New York. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. ****&#39;,
   &#39;A patchwork about 911. The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic, sometimes boring (the first one, for example), sometimes used to say to Americans &#34;we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the murderers&#34;, sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really loved the Claude Lelouch (personal live of a couple in New-York, showing that our day-to-day &#34;problems&#34; are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-wars in general), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism despite terrible day to day misery), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, having moral difficulties to accept the U.S. policy towards Arab countries) I am really pleased to see that many Americans liked this movie. It shows that we (or they ? I am still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested by other cultures, and able to question past and present actions of our government, like we should in a democracy.&#39;,
   &#39;Excellent view of a mature woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). The way she gets involved into this special &#34;business&#34;, the innocence, and the true love that exists between the people of a little town, it\&#39;s mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh, light and funny comedy. I couldn\&#39;t stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love European films, and with movies like this one, my opinion grows stronger. A movie that I also recommend with my eyes closed, in this same genre, is Waking Ned Devine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself. You will love it.&#39;,
   &#39;Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid. I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got. My favorite one was &#34;The Red Sea Sharks&#34; - so much action and humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of Herge and his development of Tintin. The film-maker\&#39;s personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the Chan character was very moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist. A great example of someone who has become internationally renown, and has brought joy of millions of children (and the young at heart) all over the world.&#39;,
   &#34;When Gundam0079 became the movie trilogy most of us are familiar with, a lot of it was sheer action and less of anything else. This OVA is kinda the opposite. Though there&#39;re only half a dozen episodes, it isn&#39;t filled with action, but emotional things. The two main action sequences in this, I believe, are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many gundam series, movies, and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civilian-esquire movie. This movie did a fantastic job of that. What makes this movie stand out is that shows both sides of the war have good and bad people. It made the Zeons seem more human rather than the original movies where they&#39;re depicted as the second rise of evil Nazis. Most people that don&#39;t like anime that I&#39;ve forced to watch this movie (lol), liked it. So, I&#39;d recommend it to a lot of people just for the anti-war story. If you&#39;re a Gundam fan, and haven&#39;t seen this, you shouldn&#39;t be reading this; you should already be watching it right now.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Yokai Daisenso&#34; is a children\&#39;s film by Takashi Miike, but as you might expect, it\&#39;s probably a bit too dark &amp; scary for younger ones. However, older children may well eat this up, that is, if you play it dubbed in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is that of a young boy, who has moved with his mother to the country, to live with his grandfather, after a divorce. During a village festival the boy is chosen as a &#34;Kirin rider&#34;, a great honor, but with that honor comes much danger and adventure, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt, go-go boots &amp; a beehive hair-do, teams up with an evil Yokai to turn people\&#39;s resentments and discarded items against them. And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the City of Rage itself, Tokyo. One quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city...says one, &#34;Oh, it\&#39;s only Gamera&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young boy has befriended Yokai, which are monsters of a kind, mostly benign, that have isolated themselves away from humans, and all the Yokai in Japan band together to fight the evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many ways Miike &amp; crew have taken the late 60\&#39;s/early 70\&#39;s Yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for (older) kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of &#34;Transformers&#34;. The look and feel of the film is great, the effects are entertaining, and some of the humor will just sail right over kid\&#39;s heads, but still, older ones might enjoy it. As for adults, there\&#39;s not much here not to like, if you\&#39;re a fan of Japanese monster movies you\&#39;ll enjoy the heck out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool &amp; fun stuff, kind of dark at times but perhaps that\&#39;s just Miike..and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.&#39;,
   &#34;I don&#39;t think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it&#39;s time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn&#39;t full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, what this film does have: an interesting study in how families&#39; deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but needed to hear those words from his parents, and to receive their forgiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved about this film: the lack of dialog. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. Something we don&#39;t get to do alot of with today&#39;s films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#34;I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street&#39; late in the show&#39;s run, but became a fan very quickly. It was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series&#39; cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a terrific TV movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vote: 9&#34;,
   &#34;This movie was very enjoyable, though you&#39;ll only like it if: - you hate going to the dentist but aren&#39;t afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk - you love horror movies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the brute actions of the main character. The fact that he&#39;s totally obsessed by cleanliness (especially in the mouth) and then catches his wives providing some oral pleasure to the mud-covered pool-man is a pretty believable reason to go overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liked it. I give it an 8.&#34;,
   &#34;Great movie, enough laughs and action for any audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call Woody Allen incestuous and not comment on the film, here I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film follows an unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased English reporter. Their search takes them into the home of the killer, and eventually to a somewhat tragic end. But don&#39;t let the plot fool you, the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers. Also, from watching the movie in a pact theater, you can just tell that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback. The second he walked on screen audience lit up. There&#39;s just something about the man and he really shines in Scoop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check it out, it&#39;s worth the trip.&#34;,
   &#34;I just saw a press screening of this film and I was pleasantly surprised. Not often is it that I get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden back together. I think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera. My favorite scene was by far (surprisingly so) Bret Ratner&#39;s piece... Without giving too much away, I&#39;ll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Chris Cooper and the Ethan Hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that I&#39;ve had in the big apple. Over all the film is a great place to take a date... especially if you&#39;re already fond of the city itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t wait for the next in the Cities of Love.&#34;,
   &#39;There is so much that can be said about this film. It is not your typical nunsploitation. Of course, there is nudity and sex with nuns, but that is almost incidental to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is set in 15th Century Italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians at Otranto. The battle between the Muslims and the Christians takes up a good part of the film. It was interesting when everyone was running from the Muslim hoards, that the mother superior would ask, &#34;Why do you fear the Muslims,; they will not do anything that the Christians have done to you?&#34; Certainly, there was enough torture on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a convent for defying her father. In the process, she witnesses and endures many things: the gelding of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new Duke, the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tarantula Sect, and a whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew. The torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun, and her nipples cut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sister Flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives. She even asks Jesus, why the father, son and holy ghost are all men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they sack the convent. Here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time. But, tragedy is to come. She manages to exact sweet revenge on all, including the Duke and her father, but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same. She is a woman and that is all there is to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won\&#39;t describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end, but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats, but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest.&#39;,
   &#39;Bravo! Morgan Freeman is an actor, who researches a character he is selected to play, before he makes a commitment. Freeman is a \&#39;good fit\&#39; for this film (like he was for &#34;Driving Miss Daisy&#34;), and he is not only believable, but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and propriety. Although there are no guarantees in life, for anyone, this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out, in order to avoid getting stereotyping. And it must be said that stereotyping has hampered, or completely ruined, a significant number of acting careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a low-budget film that, amazingly, was made in a time span of only two weeks. It is a film that is well directed and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA for the film\&#39;s setting, and the location helps set the tone and timing for the film. The editing is fair to good, but a little rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silberling was the \&#39;subcontractor\&#39;, in getting Freeman to do this film, while the actor was in-between film projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens an effective dialog between each of the cast members, who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also encourages an understanding between people, who not only speak two languages (English and Spanish), but come from two different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, mores, beliefs, folkways, principles, and values. The film strives for some honesty, and arrives at some truth, to maintain the film\&#39;s integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor that has been out of work for four years. In truth, Freeman is so-in-demand as an actor that he is constantly working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film offers an adventure of bonding, caring, sharing, changing, and exchanging. And, the film\&#39;s outtakes give the viewer a preview of some of things an actor must go through in preparing for a role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If necessary, tell your boss that you\&#39;re taking a \&#39;mental health day\&#39;, and go see this film. If you\&#39;re able, take your significant other or your family with you. I rank the film a 10 out of 10. It\&#39;s enjoyable, interesting, informative, poignant, and worthwhile.&#39;,
   &#34;A mix of comedy, romance, music(?!), action and horror. A knockout. This is one of the reasons people rave about Hong Kong cinema. If you&#39;re looking for something totally original, look no further. Entertainment at it&#39;s peak.&#34;,
   &#34;This is just a great, fun, lovely film. It captures the true essence of the decade and of the people, and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. Though this film may only be in Black and White, it definitely doesn&#39;t count against it now in modern days. The main basic purpose of the movie is timeless. This movie features great acting, beautiful song and dance numbers, and great design work and film shots. Follow the Fleet is also comical, there are funny moments, moments that will make you laugh, but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline. Its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade, how it can affect those today. If you want to see something great, check this out.&#34;,
   &#39;There is an episode of The Simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a &#34;Killbot Factory&#34;. Here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke, but what Patricia Foulkrod\&#39;s documentary does is show us, scarily, that it is not that far from the truth. After World War Two the US Army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war; that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of \&#39;me or them\&#39;. Since then the training process of the US army has been to remove all moral scruples and turn recruits into killing machines who don\&#39;t think of combatants as people. To develop in them a most unnatural state: &#34;The sustainable urge to kill&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this isn\&#39;t an antiwar movie as such. Whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light, Foulkrod focuses rather on an aspect that doesn\&#39;t get as much media attention as, say, the debate over the legality of a war or it\&#39;s physical successes or failures; the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being. It\&#39;s the paradox that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally unsuitable to live as part of that society themselves, and whilst most of the examples and interviewees are from the current Middle East conflict Foulkrod makes the links to past conflicts, especially Vietnam, painfully clear. This isn\&#39;t about any particular war, it\&#39;s about the problems caused by war in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Structurally the film seems to be split into three sections; how recruits are drawn into the army and the training they receive, how they are treated once they are in combat, and what happens once they leave the army. Once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the policies that are inherent in the armed forced, policies that are put into place to make soldiers into an affective combat force but removing all humanity from the individuals. Those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple, how word like &#34;democracy&#34; and &#34;freedom&#34; are banded around, but once the training begins they become &#34;enemy&#34; and &#34;kill&#34; and &#34;destroy&#34;. How once in action soldiers don\&#39;t care what they are ordered to do, as they are ingrained with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order, whatever it may be, they are one step closer to going home. They have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as that\&#39;s what they\&#39;ve been trained to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But The Ground Truth\&#39;s main goal is to highlight the way the US Army discards those who have fought for their country once they return home. There is no real rehabilitation given to soldiers returning, and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done, and most policies in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up. This is the final indignity, that once they are used they are cast away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a flaw in the film it is that Foulkrod doesn\&#39;t attempt to show another side to the argument. You would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. It would have been interesting to see those of a\x85 less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and policies. There is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary, and Foulkrod\&#39;s use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war.&#39;,
   &#34;I found this very touching as Spike and Heaton stay together all the way through this film not to say there isn&#39;t a few betrayals along the way. I thought the chase was put aside the relationship between the two was foreground I think. I had already guessed that there were so gay intentions on the part of Heaton. My favourite scene had to be the bit where Heaton and Spike were stuck in the marsh and Spike runs off I generally thought Spike wasn&#39;t coming back. I have to say that if it wasn&#39;t for our film studies teacher making us watch this I would have probably never seen it. Overall I thought this film was pretty good and I would recommend it to any person who is a fan of British made films.&#34;,
   &#34;Superman and the Mole Men is quite possibly Superman&#39;s toughest adventures ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home of the world&#39;s deepest oil well. While there, some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town. Jeff Corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men. Can Superman change the people&#39;s ways in time to save the mole men? Can Superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bring?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Superman and the Mole Men is a very intelligent, well-written and well-acted movie. Even though we only get to see Superman fly once briefly, It still makes a great Superman adventure. A must see for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 Stars&#34;,
   &#34;This is a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes) but it had a a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, a lot of ground to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was soap-operish at times but had some visually dramatic moments, too, capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film. That was astounding to view. Considering this film is about 70 years old, the special-effects crew on this film did a spectacular job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day and they don&#39;t disappoint here, both giving powerful performances. The only problem is credibility as all the Asians are played by Caucasions and some of them, like Walter Connolly, just don&#39;t look real. I&#39;d like to see a re-make of this movie with all-Asian actors, not for PC reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible.&#34;,
   &#39;Gandhi my father is like viewing a book, chapter by chapter you read it(with your eyes) and you learn more about Harilal Gandhi and for that matter Kasturba Gandhi. So little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely. The title misleads though, its as much a movie about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, as its about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya do full justice to their respective roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such movies are like leap years. They come after only so much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gandhi My Father, is also about an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever undertaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it, if you like quality cinema.&#39;,
   &#39;The pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes - absolutely incredible sword-moves and martial art show off. A true John Woo masterpiece. The story tends to be a bit week though, but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action. If you are into martial art movies, you are going to LOVE this one!&#39;,
   &#39;Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it\&#39;s overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense. But that\&#39;s the point, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is likable; Michael Keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me. But the complete scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri (sneaking the word &#34;Iceholes&#34; into movie history) as a mobster who fares best at murdering the English language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I associate many childhood memories with this film, as I watched it quite often so maybe I\&#39;m prone to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but it\&#39;s hard to recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 out of 10.&#39;,
   &#39;This video rocked! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I have ever seen. Not only does he have class, he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that I have ever seen. Eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic I\&#39;ve seen in a VERY long time. Tell all those other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this &#34;executive&#34; reign!&#39;,
   &#34;Maybe I&#39;m being too generous with the rating...but I just love this movie! I&#39;ve seen it so many times, but every time I see it I fall in love with it all over again. It&#39;s just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing huge or monumentous that happens. But I&#39;m a big romantic and this movie *is* romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. The scientists make me laugh so much...I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it. It&#39;s such a clean, good movie - and those are so rare now! My 20-year-old brother likes this movie, too, so it&#39;s not just a chick-flick. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you&#39;re just lonely and need to *watch* a romance, if you yourself can&#39;t participate in one. It&#39;s a good &#39;un!&#34;,
   &#39;For a while I was caught in the trap where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I liked them. Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception. It is the truth. It is the best &#34;bad&#34; movie ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;badness&#34; of this movie seems to come naturally. Halfway through Satan\&#39;s opening monologue, the word &#34;Hell&#34; appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress. It takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other FOREVER to walk down the stairs. Jesus walks to a funk soundtrack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, Fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior\&#39;s film project. But it\&#39;s the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful. You get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad, but never forced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never to be duplicated in wonder, Fatty delivers. Highly highly recommended.&#39;,
   &#34;well worth watching, especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity, you are expecting a big fall down story line as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be Brosnan&#39;s best performance to date, he convinces admirably as the English boy playing Indians. The stand out scene is the return to his ?Aunts? where Brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a wonderful scene full of feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue, just with expressions and good direction. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is so little known and the message so universal and all important it is a real pity this film did not get better recognition, maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper. I hope so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast.&#34;,
   &#34;A true classic. Beautifully filmed and acted. Reveals an area of Paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy. Although the area of &#39;Hotel du Nord&#39; and the Hotel itself still exists, it is not as gay (in the original sense of the word) and joyful as it once must have been. The film makes one yearn for the past, which has been lost, with a sigh and bittersweetness.&#34;,
   &#39;This was the first televised episode of the Columbo series (although it was filmed after &#34;Death Lends a Hand&#34;)and it heralded one of the most successful TV series in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Cassidy (who played the murderer in the series three times) enthuses smugness, arrogance and self-assuredness in equal measure here, as Ken Franklin, one half of a mystery writing team who hatches an elaborate plot to kill off his partner, Jim Ferris (played by Martin Milner) who decides to terminate their professional relationship, leaving Franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial murder set-up is fantastic and Cassidy\&#39;s performance facilitates an arguable accolade that he was the best Columbo murderer in the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Falk is wonderfully understated in his role as Columbo and the character\&#39;s inherent traits and oddities, which are underlined by a seeming slowness and absent-mindedness, contrast particularly well with Cassidy\&#39;s character\&#39;s extreme smugness: one of their early scenes together where Ken Franklin fabricates a motive for the killing through Jim Ferris\&#39;s non-existent expo-see of identifying hit-men operating in the underworld exemplifies this very well. Franklin hints to Columbo this potential motive and Columbo (purposely or ignorantly) fails to latch on, forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly patronising manner and compare him unfavourably with the detective in the books, Mrs. Melville.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of 24 year old Steven Spielberg. Notwithstanding, some elementary inclusions of cameras shadowing the actors and actresses, he adds some stylish and elaborate touches to uphold the general professionalism of the episode. One particularly stark image is of Jim Feriss\&#39;s dead body lying on the settee, almost dark in the foreground, as Ken Franklin raises a glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to Ferris\&#39;s distraught wife. I have no doubt that working to a restrictive 10-14 day schedule, Spieberg\&#39;s efforts should not be underestimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the event of the second murder, necessitated by a blackmailing scheme which is plotted by a female friend of Franklin\&#39;s (and ironically referred to as &#34;sloppy&#34; by Columbo in his climatic summing up) takes the steam out of the whole thing. The cutting edge of the plot is compromised and the screen-time between Falk and Cassidy inexcusably lessens at this point to perhaps help the script-writer (Stephen Bocho) out of a tight corner, since he cannot singularly develop the story without another murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode. The initial banter and exchange of words between Falk and Cassidy is strongly and effectively executed, but it merely advertises the fact that it should have happened more in the episode. The main aggravation lies with the sealing clue (if it can be called a clue): Cassidy\&#39;s character\&#39;s hitherto smugness and arrogance is amazingly expelled by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt; and once this is mentioned, he capitulates in a rather unspectacular and uncharacteristic fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a bold opening to the series, which inevitably advertises and foretells all that is good about Columbo, and, conversely, the problems associated with such ingenuity, i.e maintaining the high standards and particularly, creating a credible and suitably intelligent ending.&#39;,
   &#39;I saw the movie with two grown children. Although it was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was rather good. In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it. There parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments. Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful although I liked it too. Personally I liked the Scrat!!&#39;,
   &#34;In my line of work, I occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film. When I can, I take a look at these low-budget films and often they make me think that the future of Hollywood is going to the dogs. Once in a while, though, there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire, as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible. The short film B R O K E N, directed by Alex Ferrari, is a genuine surprise and worth a second look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clocking in at a scant 20 minutes, B R O K E N tries to tell a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no back story. The audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home. When she awakes, she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book. These nasty guys and girls are larger than life. They are all guns and knives. There is no way out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kicker here is that, despite being a low budget film it doesn&#39;t play like one. From the very beginning, the feeling is that B R O K E N has been shot, edited, and produced by professionals. It looks like something Quentin Tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the Wachowski brothers. The film is sharp and cool, it looks good and it feels like something big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is much better than I usually see in these smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (who plays the head killer, Duncan) were well chosen. As two of the few speaking roles in the film, it is up to them to carry the film. No special effects, no matter how good, would have saved this film from bad acting. Thankfully, Polay manages to convey true fear and Gordon manages to come off as a real psycho. Some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent, but it hardly shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to B R O K E N is that it&#39;s only 20 minutes long. The story ends with a Twilight Zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle. Watching it, I felt like I was supposed to have some epiphany, but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than I had hoped it would be. The film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop, but it comes off as unsatisfying. I keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY RATING: 8 out of 10.&#34;,
   &#39;Dana Andrews stands &#34;Where the Sidewalk Ends&#34; in this 1950 film that also stars Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews plays New York City Detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a cop with a bad temper who has gotten into trouble in the past for beating suspects. When a man is murdered at a gambling club owned by a mobster, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner go to investigate. Scalise blames the murder on Ken Paine (Stevens), who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife, Morgan (Tierney) but the victim. Dixon thinks the victim won a lot of money and was killed as a result by the mobster\&#39;s men. He goes to see Paine and, not realizing he has a plate in his head from the war, knocks him to the floor and inadvertently kills him. Now he must cover up the murder. As a further complication, he falls for Morgan; her father (Ken Tully), who went to Paine\&#39;s apartment after he saw that Paine had hit his daughter, is arrested for the crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really terrific, gritty noir with some good performances. The ruggedly handsome and weathered Andrews is convincing as a tough yet nervous detective who has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues. The movie reunites him with his fabulous &#34;Laura&#34; costar, Gene Tierney, and she looks lovely as a model with bad taste in men who apparently is used to being roughed up. Little does she know, she\&#39;s got another one on her hands. Ken Tully does a terrific job as her father, who protests his innocence despite some damning evidence. Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon\&#39;s boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this well-directed, fast-moving and absorbing film is the ending. Pure Hollywood and, putting myself in Tierney\&#39;s place, I doubt I would react the same way. A minor criticism for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I didn\&#39;t find it as awe-inspiring as &#34;Laura,&#34; but few things in this world are. If you like film noir, this is a must-see.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;ve seen this movie on several different occasions. I find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type 1: OLD PEOPLE. A lot of old Japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest-to-goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval Japanese dialogue. As soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences, the old people walk out, usually disgusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type 2: FILM SNOBS. These people think that just because a movie bears the label of &#34;Independent&#34; that it will automatically be a load of hard-to-follow, overemotional crap that may or may not be in English. Yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured. They are really in for a surprise when they see this film. As soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime-inspired sword battles or the over-the-top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation, these people will be so dismayed, they will walk out. A few will stay just to see &#34;how bad it will get&#34; and later they\&#39;ll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type 3: PEOPLE EXPECTING TO SEE LIVE-ACTION ANIME OR MATRIX-LIKE SPECIAL EFFECTS. Sorry folks, the martial arts are pretty solid in the film, but director Yamasato really doesn\&#39;t have the budget for that kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type 4: PEOPLE WITH NO EXPECTATIONS. These are the people who really enjoy the film. Whether they had only heard of Blood of the Samurai, picked it at random, or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze, these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is: ENTERTAINMENT. This movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought, it was meant (if I may borrow a line of dialogue from the film) to &#34;really kick some ass.&#34; And that\&#39;s what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So depending on what type of person you are, you may or may not enjoy this film; however, if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting, then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends.&#39;,
   &#34;Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer, who is going through a bad divorce. She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost. She wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi. Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well-written most of the time. TEa&#39;s Nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just didn&#39;t support comedy and they still don&#39;t. Even when they brought in George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters. The show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery.&#34;,
   &#39;This film is to my mind the weakest film in the original Star Wars trilogy, for a variety of reasons. However it emerges at the end of the day a winner, despite all its flaws. It\&#39;s still a very good film, even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem here is the look of the film, which isn\&#39;t very consistent with the other 2 films. I put a lot of that down to the departure of producer Gary Kurtz. The first 2 films have that dirty, lived-in look with all the technology and so forth. In &#34;Jedi&#34; on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. This makes for a much less textured film. Also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. At this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect is its lack of originality. Where &#34;Star Wars&#34; created a whole new experience in cinema and &#34;Empire&#34; brought us to alien worlds of swamps, ice, and clouds, &#34;Jedi&#34; lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film. First we are back on the desert planet Tatooine, and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn\&#39;t think of anything new... but you\&#39;d think Lucas or Kasdan could). Also we have these ewoks, who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears, in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of &#34;Star Wars&#34; if they hadn\&#39;t run out of cash. It just feels like lazy construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most unfortunate aspect of &#34;Jedi&#34; for me is the weak handling of the Han Solo character. Whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time, trading one liners with the droids. Instead of a real drama we\&#39;re stuck with the lame pretense that Han is still convinced Leia loves Luke -- as if the conclusion of &#34;Empire&#34; where she confessed her love of him had never happened. The whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the Solo character was not part of this film\&#39;s central story after his rescue. Ford, for his part, looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. This is more like a 1990s Ford performance, bored and looking &#34;above&#34; the film itself. Fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes. Lando, an interesting character introduced in &#34;Empire&#34;, here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle. Only Hamill, given an interesting development in the Luke character, is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character. Probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work. And to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters. Really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package. Ian McDiarmid does excellent work as well as the Emperor. The film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visually and in terms of effects work, other than the &#34;clean&#34; look of everything it\&#39;s hard to find fault. Jabba is a very effective animatronic character, one of the most elaborate ever constructed. The space battles towards the end are very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears. But on its own, it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of Lucas\&#39; later productions.&#39;,
   &#39;Read Eric\&#39;s review again. He perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than I ever could. I\&#39;m only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it many years ago on TV, the IFC I think. It is such a unique film I hesitate to make comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the relentless badlands of Coahuila/Zacatecas/San Luis Potosi. This isn\&#39;t the Sedona-like Durango,Mexico (of the John Wayne films) but a truly stark and wild place. I have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story. Like the location, this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone. It is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn\&#39;t actually forgotten this movie, it is indelible. Yet, over the years, I had forgotten of its existence. I know nobody who has seen it, had never read of it, nor seen any reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name, I\&#39;d even forgotten the title. Well, I\&#39;ll be looking to buy a copy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have since the above posting become a huge fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so regret not having read him before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relative to MsMyth\&#39;s comment below; the movie was filmed in Mexico but the author is Colombian and was not commenting on Mexico or Mexican history in any way, although Marquez now lives in Mexico for &#34;political&#34; reasons. This story is universal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library. Liked the movie? You have to read the story and then everything else Garcia Marquz wrote. And, by the way, the original location in the story was Colombia.&#39;,
   &#34;CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) is killed shortly after learning she is pregnant. We then see the husband in heaven letting the powers that be know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him. He is told he can return to earth but not as himself. Flashforward 19 years where we see Shepherd&#39;s daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) preparing to graduate from college and encountering a young man (Robert Downey Jr.)who, it turns out is the reincarnation of her father. The film is a little on the predictable side...the story goes all the places you expect it to, but it is so charmingly played by an energetic cast (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can&#39;t help but get wrapped up in the fun. Shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles. A lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchant you.&#34;,
   &#34;DOes anyone know where or how i can get a copy of this film?!! I&#39;ve been searching for way too long, someone help! Back in 1997 my girlfriends and i were extras on this Long Island based film, and we actually never got to see it. :( &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was hoping i could find a copy somehow so i can finally check it out, and share it with the girls! Is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this, so i can stop driving myself crazy? (also, it doesn&#39;t matter if its in in VHS format, i&#39;m still in the ice age myself.) If you, or anyone you know, has a copy of this film please help, i would be willing to pay for a good copy of it!&#34;,
   &#34;Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies, because it translates personal, subjective opinions on war, opposed war action movies where action, and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject, and manages to distance itself from usual war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn&#39;t believe in, spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas, both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. Perfect irony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is truly exceptional, and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts, hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted.&#34;,
   &#39;In 1996\&#39;s &#34;101 Dalmatians,&#34; Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitain Police (God bless them) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - dalmatians. All covered in mud and hay, she spent the next 4 years in the &#34;tin can.&#34; Now, 4 years later, she, unfortunately, was released from the jail. I say, that\&#39;s about 28 years - in dog years!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in 2000, Disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic film and it is hereby dubbed &#34;102 Dalmatians.&#34; In it, there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family (Oddball is the name, I think; I should know this since this was just shown on TV recently), and the puppy had no spots!!!!! Also, while Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) has escaped again, she wanted a bigger, better coat - made once again out of the puppies!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked the theme song - I\&#39;m sure everybody loves the &#34;Atomic Dog&#34; song from the 70s or so. And now, we hear a bit of it in this movie!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;102 Dalmatians&#34; is such a great film that I keep on wondering - WHEN WILL THERE BE A &#34;103 DALMATIANS?????&#34; LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 stars&#39;,
   &#39;It appears that there\&#39;s no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it\&#39;s often foolish and illogical. It\&#39;s also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeanette\&#39;s deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then &#34;Aloha Oe&#34; on the beach! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove.&#39;,
   &#34;Not one of your harder-hitting stories, and that&#39;s a real strength of this film. There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension. They not only spare the audience this, but throw in some surprises at the same time. There are a few Disney-ish moments, particularly near the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth the rental and it was good, relaxed fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you get the DVD, watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. We followed her directions and it was BRILLIANT! Next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it, because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out!&#34;,
   &#39;There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality that whips Latin America with regard to the kidnappings thing, the police corruption at continental level, among so many realities that we live the Latins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way. Dakota Fanning just by 10 years, an excellent actress has become and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was of marvel, I have it in my collection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that they are happened to those producing of Hollywood to make a movie completely in Venezuela, where they show our reality better with regard to the delinquency, the traffic of drugs or the political problems. They have been few the movies that they play Venezuelan land (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) they should make more, as well as they make in Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The song &#34;Una Mirada&#34; I hope that it leaves in the soundtrack, it is excellent. My vote is 10/10&#39;,
   &#34;A classy film pulled in 2 directions. To its advantage it is directed by Wes Craven. On the downside the TV film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget. It moves along as Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club. His latest invention, a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood. Anyone seeing this should pay attention to Susan Lucci. Her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later. The actor, scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film. Lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called Catherine. Lucci and Barbara Steele&#39;s portrait in &#39;Black Sunday&#39; were used as references for the Catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by Armourae. Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine. So by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie was well done in all respects. The acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which I purchased because it was so moving. It is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods &#34;white hunter,black heart&#34;. This movie is simply the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheers Zuf&#39;,
   &#39;This movie was an impressive one. My first experience with a foreign film, it was neither too long, nor too complex. I myself enjoyed the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first, but it proved to be very touching and realistic. There was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience.&#39;,
   &#34;Christopher Smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick &#39;Creep&#39;. &#39;Creep&#39; although a little bit loose on information, proves itself worthy of a true gory classic. A little less glossy than recent US horrors (Amityville Horror remake, House of Wax remake) this dark and gruesome tale follows Kate (Franka Potente) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she, and a number of others along the way, try and flee a murderous attacker. Though some bad reviews have slated this film, I truly believe that on a tight budget and for a UK production from first time director Smith that &#39;Creep&#39; truly does live up to its name. It delivers fast-paced gory action more or less from the beginning, sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas, but with a perfect location and the best character-reaction-at-the-end I&#39;ve seen in a while, &#39;Creep&#39; delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares.&#34;,
   &#34;Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10% as deranged as the one in this film, well then I guess he could have turned out worse. Unfortunately, the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture&#39;s box office appeal. Several times during the film Milligan&#39;s ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends, and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for Milligan&#39;s homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60&#39;s guitar rock. It&#39;s pretty easy to fast-forward through if you&#39;re trying to pay attention to Milligan&#39;s original film, which, unfortunately, is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes. What remains, however, is still compelling stuff. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before.&#34;,
   &#39;Once you can get past the film\&#39;s title, &#34;Pecker&#34; is a great film, perhaps one of John Waters\&#39; best. A wonderful cast, headed by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, make the story very funny, and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children, but they are there for a purpose. Unfortunately this movie was not mass produced, and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it. If the opportunity knocks, then go see this film.&#39;,
   &#34;`Europa&#39; (or, as it is also known, `Zentropa&#39;) is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless... a true feast for the eyes. The picture was a contender for a 1991&#39;s Golden Palm in Canners. The award went to Barton Fink (by Coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to Zentropa. Here&#39;s an exercise in class: rent both films and be a judge for yourself.&#34;,
   &#39;Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century. In Cold Blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling, and absolutely riveting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Blake walks away with the film. The story seems to be presented almost entirely from Perry\&#39;s viewpoint, despite Dick being the leader and planner of the pair. The viewer will invariable perceive Dick as being more unstable, immature, and generally feel like Perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for Dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy, In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold, windy night, because Dick has bought into an age-old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home. As &#34;prosecutor&#34; (a character that isn\&#39;t given a name in the script), played by Will Geer, so astutely points out, their lives are bought for only $10 a head. Director Richard Brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film, prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of Dick and Perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement, but also Perry\&#39;s own ever-escalating sense of impending doom. He repeatedly makes remarks, &#34;No one ever gets away with a thing like that,&#34; and &#34;I can\&#39;t help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us.&#34; Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime, only irritation at Perry\&#39;s. Indeed, after they are caught, it is Dick who breaks first, and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime. I felt somewhat sorry for Perry from the very beginning of the film, and more-so as events progressed, but I only loathed Dick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played. We do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters, but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred. The story is unrelenting, taunt, the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are interested in such things, I noticed a couple of the &#34;Goofs&#34; listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated. Such as the &#34;reversed&#34; process shot, at the beginning of the film, as Dick and Perry are driving across the bridge into Kansas. To begin with, this isn\&#39;t even a process shot, the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real. A large cargo truck located to the left front of Dick\&#39;s Pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed, but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I previously stated, this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema, not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence (no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to), but a thoroughly excellent film.&#39;,
   &#39;When you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing, you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work. Undying used the Unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience. The production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game. The game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision. The level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Gespenster&#34; (2005) forms, together with &#34;Yella&#34; (2007), and &#34;Jerichow&#34; (2008), the Gespenster-trilogy of director Christian Petzold, doubtless one of the creme-De-la-creme German movie directors of our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roughly, &#34;Gespenster&#34; tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in Berlin - and has never been seen ever. Since then, the mother keeps traveling to Berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches, by aid of time-dilated photography, for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age. As we hear later in the movie, the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter Marie. However, this time, when she meets Nina, everything comes quite different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie does not bring solutions, not even part-solutions, and insofar, it is rather disappointing. We are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not, if her actual daughter is still alive or not. Most disappointing is the end. After what we have witnessed in the movie, it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves Nina alone. The simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed, can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (f.ex. in &#34;Umberto D.&#34;), but in &#34;Gespenster&#34;, it is displaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since critics have been suggesting Freudian motives in this movie, let me give my own attempt: Why is it that similar persons do not know one another, especially not the persons that another similar person knows? This is quite an insane question, agreed, from the standpoint of Aristotelian logic, according to which the notion of the individual holds. The individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else. So, the Aristotelian answer to my question is: They do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change. Everybody who is not insane, believes that. However, what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change, e.g. scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade? This is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made, although I am not sure whether even the director has realized that. Despite our modern, Aristotelian world, the superstition, conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality, and that individuality, therefore, is not something erratic, but rather diffusional, so that the borders between persons are open, such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of Gespenster of the most interesting kind.&#39;,
   &#34;I thought this film was just about perfect. The descriptions/summaries you&#39;ll read about this movie don&#39;t do it justice. The plot just does not sound very interesting, BUT IT IS. Just rent it and you will not be sorry!!&#34;,
   &#39;There should be more movies about our Native Americans. I especially think that using actual real Native Americans, would be the the right thing. I know that this Archie Belaney, who was played by Pierce Brosnan he did an excellent job in portraying that character, since he was an Englishman. But my suggestion to Hollywood, is to put more American Indians into the roles, and never use anyone else. The Sioux Nation has been put on the back burner far too long. Their poverty is a disgrace to our country. It is my firm belief that our country should return the Black Hills to the Sioux. We ask Israel to return their lands to the Arabs, but we do not make any effort to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!&#39;,
   &#34;A Thief in the Night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers. I have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting God. They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night. Do not listen! These movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation, but they&#39;re also fun to watch in their simplicity. They are in fact low-budget and that is a little obvious, but not all too obvious upon first viewing. I had no clue because I really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70&#39;s included low-budgets all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical Patty Myers who lives for what comes her way, until her husband, and nearly all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone warned her about. At first, the movie isn&#39;t all based around her until the rapture happens. What it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in Christ, which is usually what happens to a lot of people. Everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever, and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves. No one can ever blame themselves because they&#39;re always right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like these whiners who complain about the movie. These people must be full grown adults. I&#39;m thirteen, and you don&#39;t see me whining, especially since I was exactly like Patty before I re-accepted Christ into my heart. For those who haven&#39;t seen it, if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a Christian movie instead of stereo-typical everyone else is wrong movies, than you&#39;ll enjoy A Thief In The Night. Don&#39;t knock it before you try it. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.&#34;,
   &#39;Who votes in these ratings? &#34;Jacknife&#34; is a beautifully acted, brilliantly observed piece of work, with actors on top of their game, especially Ed Harris and the peerless Robert DeNiro(please don\&#39;t mention Marlon Brando in the same breath of this man-see &#34;Taxi Driver&#34; for confirmation of this point). Is it a \&#39;mundane\&#39; movie because it doesn\&#39;t have sex/meaningless action/nudity in it. This movie is about the complexities of the characters involved. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking. The part where he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and the movies exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men must feel to see a young upstart sporting military attire. While we are on this subject, &#34;Casino&#34; 7.8 out of 10? One of the greatest films of all time, from one of the greatest directors, starring THE greatest movie actor of all time, with the scariest film psychotic gangster ever, only warrants just above average? COME ON!!!!!&#39;,
   &#34;Leave it to Braik to put on a good show. Finally he and Zorak are living their own lives outside of Spac Ghost Coast To Coast. I have to say that I love both of these shows a whole lot. They are completely what started Adult Swim. Brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000. It may not have been platinum, but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love Adult Swims shows. I have to say that out of all the Adult Swim shows with no plot, this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made. That is why I like it so much, it is just such a classic in the Adult Swim history. I believe this is just such a great show, if you don&#39;t like it. Hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it.&#34;,
   &#34;At the start, this one is from England, so, of course, I had 98 % chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema. I never heard of this film before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself : Oh! Here&#39;s comes the feminine version of My Left Foot. I was right, but I was also wrong. Wrong because the two movies are very differents. My Left Foot was a John Ford alike movie and this one is a Chaplin alike movie (not because this is funny, but Chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) I was right because in 1990 handsome Daniel Day-Lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality. Here, very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same thing, but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and it&#39;s very intelligent. For me, miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the greatest woman&#39;s part of the 1990&#39;s, with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since Jobyna Ralston, Louise Brooks, Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She&#39;s also a true talent, as seen on many other movies. See this one, you won&#39;t regret it! And a very fine job by Branagh too!&#34;,
   &#39;Although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is in fact nothing of the sort. It is a political and cultural allegory of Mexico\&#39;s post-Columbian odyssey, as even a passing glance at Mexico\&#39;s history will attest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to &#34;Like Water for Chocolate,&#34; &#34;Erendira&#34; expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work. (A good starting point is to see the grandmother character as Spain: proud, aloof, sorrowful and, above all else, weighed-down-with-history.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the &#34;outcome&#34; of history (i.e. the present) is always obscure, since we are too close to it for honest evaluation. Refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director, given the ambitions of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Erendira&#34; is gorgeous. A big-screen experience would be ideal, if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening. But if not, VHS is better than never seeing it at all.&#39;,
   &#34;He-he-hello!! This is a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your fun-lovin&#39;, independent, early 90&#39;s New Yorker chick. Along with her party friends, she meets a mature Turkish Vendor. It is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do. It is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie great. I have never been a great fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies. There are subtle manerisms that perfected her character. If you want good laughs and a fun time, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewings are a must.&#34;,
   &#34;Many of the reviewers have made it a point to note that Pinjar is unlike the run of the mill films produced in Bollywood. While this is true, Bollywood films in general are geared to a specific audience and should be appreciated for accomplishing their aims in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,Pinjar is an excellent film for those seeking a change from the normal equation based Bollywood film. Set during the time of Partition between India and Pakistan, Pinjar focuses on a Punjabi girl who becomes the victim of societal and cultural attitudes toward the treatment of women in her time. Paro, the protagonist, is forced to choose between a life with a man who has abducted her and the fleeting hope of a life with her family back in Indian ruled Punjab. More than an issue of Hindus and Muslims, Pinjar addresses and defines a woman&#39;s role as a daughter, as a wife, and as a mother in India and Pakistan in 1947. Unlike typical Bollywood films which are escapist in nature, Pinjar is a film that makes its audience contemplate these issues during and after the film.&#34;,
   &#39;So fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the Palm Springs International Film festival. Upon entering the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film. Looking at the card I turned to my wife and said, &#34;How many movies in your life do you think you can rate as superb? Only about 5 for me.&#34; But then watching the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while viewing the spectacular scenery in the film\&#39;s setting of New York state, I slowly starting bumping the movie up a category at a time. Certainly it was good but the totally natural repoire of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing detective rather than this film, the movie jumped to the excellent level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and callous heart melted just like the Grinch\&#39;s and I ended up giving this a superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This picture is a must for anyone who has parents. No violence or nudity but some strong language.&#39;,
   &#39;Great acting, great movie. If you are thinking of building see this movie first. The dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same. The humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt.&#39;,
   &#34;Ghosts That Still Walk is one of those films that grabs you and doesn&#39;t let go until the end, especially when you see it as a child. Seeing the film as an adult, you have to admit it isn&#39;t really all that scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains allot of great mysterious scenes (especially the ones with the creepy mummy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandma in their new RV; the scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary. Also the scenes where the main character discovers his mother&#39;s secret is pretty frightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the acting in the film isn&#39;t all that great and the film sometimes seems to get a little bit boring, but overall Ghosts That Still Walk is fun. Too bad only a few people saw this film, this film really deserves better. I just wanna say: Mr. Flocker, you&#39;ve done a good job! And for all you Hollywood producers out there; If you want to remake a movie, remake this one!&#34;,
   &#39;Deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom, as it primarily takes place on one set. The premise is that an accomplished playwright, whose star is falling, receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play, to the (loud) protests of his wife. Or so you think, for the first half of the movie. Past the halfway mark, Deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head, then right around, and then in a mad spin, all the time keeping its title appropriate. It\&#39;s an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Caine, as the senior playwright, plays himself in this movie - a slightly loony and very dramatic Brit. No surprises here - he does his usual good work. He gets the best line of Deathtrap, which he executes perfectly: &#34;What is your definition of success, being gang-banged in a state penitentiary?&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He also gets to show off his very toned body, which he must\&#39;ve retained coming off the Superman movies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caine and Reeve have collaborated in another movie that\&#39;s one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. It similarly revolves around a play as well, although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They are joined by comic veterans Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play. On the surface, the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch. Wish this underrated movie was available on DVD.&#39;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t understand your objections to this movie. It is a taut, thrilling extension of the character created in &#34;Basic Instinct&#34;. The only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic, is the fact that Sharon Stone\&#39;s character is still alive and not in jail at this late date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER ALERT: As the movie progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) Sharon Stone\&#39;s character is killing all these people because she\&#39;s crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) David Thewlis\&#39; crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame Sharon Stone\&#39;s character; 3) David Morrissey\&#39;s analyst is killing these people for revenge. What upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the &#34;real&#34; story. (Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of &#34;2001, A Space Odyssey.&#34; WHO CARES what is real? The blonde really is crazy, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. What\&#39;s important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. Like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. Get over it!&#39;,
   &#39;This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no &#34;good plot&#34; or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan\&#39;s movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while American movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Porn is watched for the porn, Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION, i think you people are rating it bad because there\&#39;s no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. Sure the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that. This did change the way how American action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie. If you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan\&#39;s, hes pure in everyway. He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies. American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece&#39;,
   &#39;Man, if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading that title, then you are a retard and you deserve to be disappointed. As for myself, I was expecting a low-budgeted cheeseball zombie flick- and that\&#39;s exactly what I got. I wasn\&#39;t disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool little movie. The zombies were exactly as they should be, because all of the zombies had JUST been turned, so they are freshly-undead zombies. Obviously they did that because it would\&#39;ve been pretty costly if they had done full-on rotted zombie FX. I understood the whole thing, I have no idea how anyone could seriously nitpick this movie. It\&#39;s called &#34;HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD&#34; for the love of God! Would you watch &#34;Redneck Zombies&#34; and ANY Uwe Boll movie and actually EXPECT it to be great? Of course not! So why there are some morons on IMDb whining like school girls about this movie, I\&#39;ll never understand. Oh and YES, there ARE worse movies out there, so stop saying that this was the worst you\&#39;ve ever seen, \&#39;cause you know you\&#39;re full of it! You ever watch &#34;ZOMBIEZ&#34;???? Or &#34;Feardotcom&#34;????? Or &#34;House Of The Dead&#34;???? THOSE are some of the worst I\&#39;ve ever seen. If you can\&#39;t see that it\&#39;s just a low- budgeted zombie movie obviously made by zombie movie fans, then something\&#39;s wrong with you. I just had fun with it. Thumbs up from me and I\&#39;d also like to see a sequel.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Foxes&#34; is one movie I remember for it\&#39;s portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970\&#39;s. As I am exactly Jodie Foster\&#39;s age, I related to this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships &amp; rebellion of youth. The soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg. &#34;More Than a Feeling&#34; by Boston and sad numbers like &#34;On the Radio&#34; by Donna Summer. The music of my late teens. Yep, I\&#39;ll always remember this one, even if it wasn\&#39;t huge.&#39;,
   &#34;Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bend it Like Beckham is a very funny feel good movie that doesn&#39;t need to be deep and complex, it&#39;s just fine as it is. The cast are all very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great Family movie 8/10&#34;,
   &#39;This sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936. Visually it is a wonder to behold, but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress.This gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times.Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke,both great actors,come off as quite a pair of fanatics. Ralph Richardson is very good as the &#34;The Boss&#34; a megalomaniac warlord. The prediction of World War II was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time. I\&#39;m sure glad that war didn\&#39;t turn out as it did in the movie. There are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie\&#39;s different episodes. Although its not as entertaining as I hoped it would be,this movie sticks in your mind long after you\&#39;ve seen it.&#39;,
   &#34;I had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis play Christy Brown in My Left Foot. In fact off the scene his role wasn&#39;t even over. He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back. To me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role I believe it is quite true to say he put on the most Oscar worthy performance in history. He was so masterful in this tough a part that I believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him. Although I cannot say it is the greatest movie of all time I can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it wasn&#39;t even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet I will ever seen an actor do. Probably a man too for that matter.&#34;,
   &#39;Theodore Rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time, and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression!! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century, such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking, and make any work by Spielberg look trite and elementary. At the time of it\&#39;s release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film-making to levels never anticipated by film makers. The concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur, but adapting an action packed, thrilling detective novel, co-staring a &#34;talking&#34; dinosaur with a post-modern name such as &#34;Theodore&#34;, and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it. The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is much akin to looking into the face of God and hearing Him say &#34;you are my most beloved creation.&#34; This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR!!!&#39;,
   &#39;The people who are bad-mouthing this film are those who don\&#39;t understand film to begin with. These are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that doesn\&#39;t star Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first, but what it lacks in plot, it more than makes up for in substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it\&#39;s use of music, which plays a large part. Those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie, both in Vida and Wilder\&#39;s life, and in the background. Wilder\&#39;s theme, Vida\&#39;s theme, and Wallace\&#39;s theme are all heard in the opening sequence, and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out. For instance, in the scene where the men are singing &#34;Duke of Earl&#34;, Vida is with Wilder when the men sing something like &#34;She is my girl&#34;, and then she goes over to Wallace to give him something when the men sing the lyric &#34;She will be my girl&#34; cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers There are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie, and while it may look like a flop on the outside, the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is.&#39;,
   &#39;While essentially a remake of the original Chinese Ghost Story, this third installment has higher production values and greater subtlety in both the acting and the story. Tony Leung is particularly good. CGS III is a gorgeous, moving film.&#39;,
   &#39;Why has this not been released? I kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it hasn\&#39;t been. How wrong can a girl be! This film is, in a word, enthralling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be captivated. It holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final part of the film, the &#34;episode&#34; as it were (not giving anything away, you saw that in the trailer) is also unmissable. You will chose a favourite, you will be shocked, you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens. The adrenalin rises and you cant not watch. Cudos to the actors, it\&#39;s very believable. And it doesn\&#39;t stop there, they have a final shock for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes you question reality TV and if you would watch. And how far away from this are we, really? Endemol (who make big brother) made a TV show in Holland last year offering a dying woman\&#39;s kidney to patients in need of a transplant. The show was revealed at the end to be a hoax, ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation, but are we getting too close for comfort?&#39;,
   &#34;I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in &#39;02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It had some sort of warmth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;ve had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular &#39;home&#39; which they leave. They are nomads, and that&#39;s really refreshing and uplifting to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they&#39;re really all good friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don&#39;t really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there&#39;s also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Stargate SG-1&#34; follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG-1 through a device called the Stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having seen this series sporadically for it\&#39;s first few seasons when it first came out, I didn\&#39;t know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I had last seen an episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. &#34;Stargate SG-1&#34; is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. And why? Because it runs on an amazing premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that doesn\&#39;t work on the time restriction of film. The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it\&#39;s all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Stargate SG-1&#34; kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goaul\&#39;d threat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goaul\&#39;d and preventing attacks on Earth. After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of Goaul\&#39;d/replicator/ori conflicts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The 8th season is probably the most mixed one. It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O\&#39;Neil. They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG-1 and human/Jaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it\&#39;s a little hard to find that it ends. The big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG-1.&#39;,
   &#34;Elisha Cuthbert plays Sue a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father, until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late 18th century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face poverty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was clicking through the channels and found this..I read the synopsis and suddenly saw Elisha Cuthbert...I thought okay....and watched the movie.. i didn&#39;t realise Elisha had done films before....&#39;The Girl Next Door and 24&#39; Elisha provides a satisfactory performance, the plot is a little cheesy but the film works...Its amazing how this young girl went on to become the Hottest babe in Hollywood!&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is a great way for the series to finally end. Peter (the boy from Puppet Master III) is all grown up and is now the Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn Toulon\&#39;s secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets. Most of this movie is footage from Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master, and Retro Puppet Master (sorry... But I guess Paramount wouldn\&#39;t let them use scenes from 1). Personally I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say &#34;This is THE final movie in the series...&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;As an old white housewife I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors. anyone who appreciates his work like in Deep Cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor. Since I think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting. All of the acting is quite good. If you can&#39;t take lower Manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorified action shoot-em ups) then this is not a film you would enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburne&#39;s usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go at each other some day in a movie.&#34;,
   &#34;This is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama. My all-time favourite actor, Robert Culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system, kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime, and homicidal psychosis. The teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes, and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of Dragnet look evenhanded by comparison. But what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie, building the fear and paranoia by degrees, as well as the feel of the whole California setting. The cars are really great as well, as I recall. I give this film a 10, and I defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute. Remember, just because it&#39;s made-for-television doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t great art.&#34;,
   &#34;Winchester &#39;73 is a great story, and that&#39;s what I like about it. It&#39;s not your everyday western--it uses a rifle, which passes hands from various characters--as a mechanism for telling the story about these people. Rock Hudson plays an indian chief, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west. It&#39;s important to note for those politically correct types--they kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse. By today&#39;s standards, it&#39;s still pretty violent. But it&#39;s a great story and worth watching. Enjoy!&#34;,
   &#39;This is the Columbo that got directed by Steven Spielberg at an early point in his career. It\&#39;s nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for Spielberg can be seen in this movie. The movie is basically in the same style as most of Spierlberg\&#39;s \&#39;70\&#39;s movies and TV works. So that means that some characters tend to show some quirkiness\&#39;s and no I\&#39;m not just talking about the Columbo character alone. The kind of character quirkiness which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 Spielberg movie &#34;Jaws&#34;. But other than some small hints of typical early Spielberg elements, you can\&#39;t call this movie the work of- and fine example of a rising director star. Not that its bad, of course it isn\&#39;t but as I said earlier, it also isn\&#39;t anything too sensational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie began really well and very promising but after it\&#39;s fine opening, in which as always the murder occurred, the movie became sort of more slow and also dull to watch. Dull because it\&#39;s mostly a Columbo movie by the book that doesn\&#39;t have real memorable moments in it, not dull because it\&#39;s a boring movie to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer murdering his writing partner showed some great and interesting potential. The story however didn\&#39;t really explored all of its possibilities. At least that\&#39;s the feeling this movie left me with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie was still a good one to watch nevertheless thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he\&#39;s smarter then Columbo, due to his mystery/crime writing experience and tries to give him all kinds of possible hints, leading away from himself. But of course Columbo knows better and he is his number one suspect from the first moment on but he as usual plays the game along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie does have a good overall style and uses some fine camera position and editing. Funny to see that also most of this was all mostly consistent with Spielberg\&#39;s later work, especially some of the camera-angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fine and perfectly watchable Columbo movie but don\&#39;t let the name of Spielberg attached to it rise your expectations for it too highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#39;,
   &#34;I hate reading reviews that say something like, &#39;Don&#39;t waste your time, this film stinks on ice.&#39; It does to that reviewer yet for me, it may have some sort of naïve charm. If you like the other &#39;Whistler&#39; series films, this one will be watchable. If you like 40s noirish films, this one will be watchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the earlier series entries which starred Richard Dix as the protagonist. It&#39;s much slower, and the plot is trite. You&#39;ve seen this same narrative device used in many other films, and usually better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the acting is good, and so is the lighting, and the dialog. It&#39;s just lacking in energy and you&#39;ll likely figure out exactly what&#39;s going on and how it&#39;s all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#39;Whistler&#39; series is semi-noir, and there character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself. But this film is not noir. It&#39;s too light weight and Hollywood innocent for that. Neither Richard Dix&#39;s character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end. You just never knew until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still, I&#39;ll recommend this one for at least a single viewing. I&#39;ve watched it at least twice myself, and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times.&#34;,
   &#39;Bogdonovich\&#39;s (mostly) unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other. A film that has the feel of a fairy tale, but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic Manhattan locations and &#34;true&#34; geography, perhaps the best location filming in NYC I\&#39;ve ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be brilliant, and the entire ensemble is a group you\&#39;ll wish truly existed so you could spend time with `em. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn\&#39;t seem to be a rip-off of something else, this is the high point of Bogdanovich\&#39;s fertile after- &#34;success&#34; career, when his best work was truly done (&#34;saint jack&#34;, &#34;at long last...&#34;, &#34;noises off&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;As Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen turns a marvelously deranged performance in &#34;The Dentist&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With his already obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear, the IRS hounding him, and a very suspicious acting wife; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing his sanity more and more each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Doc indeed does realize that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy, it sets off a string of events that lead to torture, murder, ant total mayhem! &#34;The Dentist&#34; is a solid film! Bernsen makes the character of Dr. Feinstone relatable and hateable at the same time. Even though he is completely out of his gourd, the audience will still feel sympathy towards him. That my friends.....is damn good acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice solid cast of supporting actors round out this gem of a film. Excellent direction, good killings and gore, and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!&#39;,
   &#39;Gregory Peck\&#39;s brilliant portrayal of Douglas MacArthur from the Battle of Corregidor in the Philippines at the start of the Pacific War largely through to his removal as UN Commander during the Korean War offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities. Certainly the most controversial American General of the Second World War (and possibly ever) MacArthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions. He claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace, yet he obviously glories in war; he consistently denies any political ambitions, yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate; he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter, yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the President of the United States; he shows great respect for other cultures (particularly in the Philippines and Japan) and yet is completely out of touch with his own country. All these things are held in balance throughout this movie, and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man, although one is left with no doubt that MacArthur sincerely and passionately loved his country, and especially the Army he devoted his life to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peck\&#39;s performance was, as I said, brilliant - to the point, actually, of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film (which is perhaps appropriate, given who he was portraying!) with the possible exception of Ed Flanders. I though he offered a compelling look at Harry Truman and his attitude to MacArthur: sarcastic (repeatedly referring to MacArthur as &#34;His Majesty,&#34;) angry, frustrated and finally completely fed up with this General who simply won\&#39;t respect his authority as President. Marj Dusay was also intriguing as MacArhur\&#39;s wife Jean, devoted to her husband (whom she herself referred to as &#34;General,&#34; although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one.) I very much enjoyed this movie, although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about MacArthur\&#39;s early life. I have always chuckled at MacArthur\&#39;s reaction to Eisenhower being elected President (&#34;He\&#39;ll make a fine President - he was the best damn clerk I ever had&#34; - which seems to sum up what MacArthur thought the role of the President should be, especially to his military commanders during wartime.) Well worth watching. 8/10&#39;,
   &#39;I was not expecting much from this movie, but was very pleasantly surprised, as it is light and funny and very well observed. The central trio of deadbeat bikers were surprisingly likable as they staggered and clowned their way through their drug-centred trip to Wales. The humour was gentle and subtle, as indeed were the three characters (witness their sympathetic treatment of the little old lady shopkeeper). The atmospherics of rural Wales were captured perfectly, and the soundtrack was very well chosen. Cleverly and carefully scripted, with great attention to detail - I have never seen such a realistic portrayal of alternative culture - I felt I was there with them. Very light in touch and full of fun - not what you might expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A delight on all fronts, and difficult to criticise, though I thought the last two scenes were a bit lame - the film should have ended when they left Wales. But overall, an unexpected treasure of a film.&#39;,
   &#34;We have high expectations with this one . . . because its Zombi 3 the official sequel to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci . . . however . . . its co-directed by Bruno Mattei (from Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and its shot in the Phillimines like Night of the Zombies and resembles Night of the Zombies (Hell of the Living Dead) a lot. as a result its more like a companion to Hell of the Living Dead than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis who produced Zombi 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombi 2 its magic . . . Zombi 3 is not magical . . . its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut-butter. But over the years, I&#39;ve grown to accept Zombi 3. I could swear I saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room . . . there was a senseless Fulci-cut and the Mattei/Fulci-cut is the one on DVD.&#34;,
   &#34;i say the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated film.anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies;jfk, rfk, mlk,g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention a few.the conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential history.god help us,but the domino principle is more fact than fantasy.if this causes a little loss of sleep, maybe it should.don&#39;t take my word for it,investigate for yourselves.&#34;,
   &#34;Moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you&#39;re not a Michael Jackson fan. I&#39;m a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film, the ending wasn&#39;t fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were - if you&#39;re a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally believe the first 50 minutes are re-watchable many times over. The dancing in each video is breathtaking, the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes many of his finest videos from Bad and snippets from his earlier videos. It also includes some live concert footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a big fan of Michael Jackson this is a must, if you&#39;re not a fan/don&#39;t like Michael Jackson, steer well clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&#34;,
   &#34;Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I&#39;ve heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say to that is...are you kidding me? Come on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie I really didn&#39;t even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell that Damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne. Sometimes that can be a bad thing, but in this case its a really good thing. He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a great supporting cast in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast, as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action, they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on. This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!&#34;,
   &#34;As part of the celebration of the release of Casino Royale, this film with the new Bond starring in it was shown, from director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off for being a bit boring, but I&#39;m glad I stuck with it. Basically May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. Her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). After knowing each other only a few days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And at her age, with a 30-something, and the new Bond?! Anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but May has regrets and wonders if Helen will find out. When she does, Darren gets less hassle than May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also starring Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English&#39;s Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;m not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is truly something else. Gundam wing lacks all of that stereotypical melodrama that you might think of when you think of anime, since the number of jokes made over the 17 hours would only be in the double digits, Gundam Wing gets right down to business. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gundam Wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series. Large parts focus on the diplomatic dealings of a war, not only the battles. Though battle animation lacks extreme detail in cases where it would just be a pain to animate, individual duels between gundams are almost pieces of art considering the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my knowledge, this 49 episode plus one movie series was picked up by cartoon network in 2000, and then professionally dubbed by them too. the dubbing is simply flawless. not only does every word said match up, but the voices use truly make the characters much more believable. many believe that it is best to watch anime with subs in English, but i simply don&#39;t have the determination to do that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are the voices good, but the score used over the series is quite impressive. I&#39;ll just say it left me scouring the net in vain to find a soundtrack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of this series is what will truly hook viewers, and no, not hook you like some prime time drama like Lost which was only made for the purpose of hooking you. explaining the plot deeply would lead to many spoilers, since many of the characters do not even have names until quite a few episodes into the series. The rough idea of the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies are having difficulty maintaining peace. Thus a war is started, leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations. I feel that any more detail would begin to give away information, which is crucial to the plot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll end here saying that this series is great for anyone that likes anime, anyone that thinks ALL anime is stupid (they have good reason to think so), and anyone looking to get into anime with a serious tone to it.&#34;,
   &#34;I would reccomend this film to everyone. Not only to the fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue, but to all film-buffs. Because it&#39;s sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover, and every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Because most of the Italian debut films are lousy and this one, done by an outsider, is a real joy to watch and to listen at. Because Stefano Accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who was, like Freccia, beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin, that Ligabue shows as it is, unglamorous and ugly, without indulging in easy moralisms. Because it&#39;s a film that speaks to our heart, our ears, our souls. And because I lived the experience of the FM radios and it was exactly like that. Thanks, Luciano!&#34;,
   &#39;Ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is a &#34;Master positive&#34; 2nd generation originally from the print Visconti managed to hide from the fascists. It has been scanned on the Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) then processed using DaVinci Revival restoration software. After this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring. Sometime next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come.&#39;,
   &#34;Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated Batman straight to video/DVD movie to be released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot revolves around a new crimefighter, the Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping a major arms shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the movie is interesting enough, it&#39;s not as good as &#39;Mask of the Phantasm,&#39; &#39;Sub-Zero,&#39; or &#39;Return of the Joker.&#39; The main reason being is that it doesn&#39;t give off the emotional appeal the other movies did. At the end of this movie, we don&#39;t really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others, especially, &#39;Sub-Zero.&#39; There is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a &#39;tragic&#39; character (as Mr. Freeze or Phantasm were). Not only that, but Batwoman&#39;s alter ego seems so incredibly &#39;stiff&#39; and dull that the viewer doesn&#39;t really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we don&#39;t get this special emotional appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I did find the movie enjoyable. It does have its moments, such as, when the audience finds out who Batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original &#39;Batman: The Animated Series.&#39; The action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Batwoman&#39;s background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than &#39;Return of the Joker&#39; in my book, but as it is now, it&#39;s in 4th (out of 4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the animation, it&#39;s the same as The New Batman Adventures&#39; cartoon from the mid to late 1990&#39;s. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman films, but it&#39;s still good nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is enjoyable. But just remember, it&#39;s not as good as the other Batman animated movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#34;,
   &#39;Good work by everyone, from scriptwriters, director, and cast; a lovely fun film that becomes believable for sentimental reasons only; a good film for television on those cloudy, cold wintry days when you just want to sit back and enjoy.&#39;,
   &#34;The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki&#39;s attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more &#39;Lupinesque&#39; anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I&#39;m not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she&#39;s basically a female Long John Silver. Don&#39;t be surprised if you&#39;re reminded of &#39;Treasure Planet&#39; at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I&#39;ll come back to that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is &#39;admire&#39;. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn&#39;t care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That&#39;s where Laputa falls down as far as I&#39;m concerned, and that&#39;s what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire &#39;Great Mouse Detective&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it&#39;s over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier &#39;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa.&#34;,
   &#39;Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story for that matter), this in my opinion is the best of them all. Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, e.g. the absence of Scylla &amp; Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes Odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece,not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick. Notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian, if one is familiar with the storyline, he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the Odyssey at hand). At least I did, and so much so that it has inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the movie even more.&#39;,
   &#34;Zombie Chronicles isn&#39;t something to shout about, it&#39;s obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining B-movie directed by Brad Sykes who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick. The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but that&#39;s what makes it more entertaining, the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget, the gore is also great and gross, the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods, the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale. Zombie Chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there, if you love low budget B-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out Zombie Chronicles.&#34;,
   &#34;There are few really hilarious films about science fiction but this one will knock your sox off. The lead Martian&#39;s Jack Nicholson take-off is side-splitting. The plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed. This is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all. Make some popcorn and have a great evening.&#34;,
   &#39;Greetings again from the darkness. How rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain. Adam Sandler stars as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy, and has since lost his career, his reason to live and arguably, his sanity. Don Cheadle co-stars as Sandler\&#39;s former Dental School roommate who appears to have the perfect life (that Sandler apparently had prior to 9/11).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the parallels in these men\&#39;s lives are obvious, but it is actually refreshing to see men\&#39;s feelings on display in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge, that is. Watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt. Writer/Director Mike Binder (&#34;The Upside of Anger&#34;, and Sandler\&#39;s accountant in this film) really brings a different look and feel to the film. Some of the scenes don\&#39;t work as well as others, but overall it is well written and solidly directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler\&#39;s character reminds a bit of his fine performance in &#34;Punch Drunk Love&#34;, but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle\&#39;s wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in an oddly appealing role), Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler\&#39;s in-laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined. In addition to the interesting story and some great shots of NYC, you have to love any film that features vocals from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder impersonating Daltrey. Not exactly a chipper upbeat film, but it is a quality film with an unusual story.&#39;,
   &#39;There were a lot of films made by Hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public. Seen today, some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda--which they technically are, but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation. This film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre--having a pretty realistic script and good production values. Pat O\&#39;Brien plays pretty much the same character he played in MANY other films (you know, the tough-talking, hard-driven but &#34;swell guy&#34;). Randolph Scott is, as always, competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombardiers in training). While the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews, the film is well-crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That it, perhaps, except for the very end--where the film is a bit over-the-top but also VERY satisfying. About the only serious negative, and this is mostly for nitpickers, is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and &#34;nuts&#34; like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this--all others probably won\&#39;t notice.&#39;,
   &#39;I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me. I was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so coherently and hilariously portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is delightful and Ustinov plays the &#34;retro hacker&#34; perfectly. &#34;O Nolo Mio&#34;!!!!!&#39;,
   &#39;10/10 for this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i\&#39;m a british india doctor, currently in india. the word Beckham put me off, \&#39;cos i\&#39;m a die hard Liverpool fan, and personally think that Owen is really cool. Since Liverpool and Man Utd are rivals, i was DEAD sure that i wouldn\&#39;t watch the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then i was in delhi to meet some friends, and i had an early morning flight, so i thought, &#34;what the heck, let\&#39;s bide time by watching this film&#34;, \&#39;cos it was a late night show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a moron i was. I should\&#39;ve seen this film the day it was released. I guess using Beckham\&#39;s name was to draw audience attraction (which had back-fired in my case!!!), but then i really can\&#39;t think of a better title for the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Nagra, Knightley (drop dead gorgeous), and Rhys-Myers did a superb job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate football, dislike Manchester United (or England for that matter), then this is DEFINATELY the film for you. In fact, i\&#39;m just 29 yrs old, a psychiatrist by profession, but a kid at heart. This film has knocked &#34;Star Wars&#34; off my no.1 position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, there aren\&#39;t very many comments on this film by indian-brits like me. I wonder why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 for this film.&#39;,
   &#39;Although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows: &#34;Fire in Space&#34; and &#34;Living Legend&#34;, if you watch the original shows you\&#39;ll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. I would say if you want to see the show in its original version, see the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on DVD now. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more scenes from Galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves. Overall, I rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers.&#39;,
   &#39;Before I start, I should point out that I know the editor of this film. We\&#39;ve never met, but we belong to the same fanzine(those things which came before message boards), and we have talked on the phone, so I do have a bias here. Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, it\&#39;s ironic how while the &#34;Rat Pack&#34; culture of the late 50\&#39;s and early to mid-60\&#39;s made a comeback in the mid-90\&#39;s, this movie, from the son of one of the original Rat Pack, and which was made in a similar fashion, was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop; I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not savage this(he gave it a mixed review, as I recall). And while I don\&#39;t think this is the greatest film in the world, and I am not a fan of the Rat Pack, or &#34;cocktail,&#34; culture, I do think this is worth seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, this looks stylish, and moves right along. For another, the core performances are all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium, and has a droll edge to him. Jeff Goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre-blockbuster days, like THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is only required to vamp in this movie, she does it entertainingly. Admittedly, it\&#39;s not a great film; the dialogue is mostly made up of puns, and a lot of them don\&#39;t work(like the whole &#34;Zen of Ben&#34; speech). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are awful here. Still, I was entertained, and if you like gangster films, you might be too.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a great little film, that&#39;s very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!. All the characters are great, and the story while bizarre, is fascinating and very interesting, plus Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this!. It&#39;s very hard to describe this movie, because it really is quite bizarre, it&#39;s a comedy/romance, one minute then it turns into a thriller the next, however it was still very entertaining all the same, plus Nicole&#39;s Russian accent was fantastic, and extremely convincing. Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together, and i loved Vincent Cassel&#39;s performance!, plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise!. The ending was very cute, and it&#39;s unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!. You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way that he is scammed, and i thought all the characters were really likable, plus the finale is especially good.This is Nicole&#39;s movie though, and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance!. This is a great little film, that&#39;s very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!, i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Jez Butterworth does a very good job here, with great camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace!. The Acting is wonderful!. Nicole Kidman, is stunningly gorgeous!, and is amazing as always, she is incredibly sexy, very likable, had one of the coolest accents, added a lot of presence, had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin, and had a very mysterious character!, she was amazing. (Kidman Rules!!!!). Ben Chaplin is great here, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, had very good chemistry with Kidman, the only thing i didn&#39;t like was him taking out his anger out on Kidman, even though what she did was wrong, and i loved how he got revenge in the end!. Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain, yes he was OTT, but he was very intense and quite creepy at times, this role was perfect for him. Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here, but didn&#39;t have much to do. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;The Last Wave&#34; is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind. The title refers to the Aboriginal doomsday theory: there will be one last wave that wipes out everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer hired to defend some Aborigines accused of murder. Around this time, there has been unusually heavy rainfall in Australia. While defending the Aborigines, David learns the last wave theory, and begins to wonder whether it\&#39;s just mythology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie\&#39;s last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one\&#39;s mind. Peter Weir created a perplexing, but thought-provoking, movie. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (whom you may have seen in &#34;Walkabout&#34;, &#34;Crocodile Dundee&#34; and &#34;Rabbit-Proof Fence&#34;) provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a chance, watch the &#34;making of&#34; feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the film\&#39;s undertones, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain\&#39;s background.&#39;,
   &#34;The mere fact that I still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film. To me this substantiates Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another. I truly believe that before the movie Crash there was Grand Canyon. The major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release. I&#39;m not going to argue which one is better, but I will contend to the idea that they share the same message. I&#39;d love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject. I will start a commentary which you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share, because i have a true love for film.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didn&#39;t see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better put together movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a whole bunch of T&amp;A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie!!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper&#39;s review of this movie is right on. I mean, I don&#39;t really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.&#34;,
   &#39;This film was amazing. It is an inspiring piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth in which Director, Lucy Walker brings to the film. I highly recommend this to any one looking for that special film that shows the humanity in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker showcases the landscape beauty. This film id a true example of man vs. nature and sometimes man vs. man. The inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter. The subject of how the Tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been showcased. Lucy Walker has given Erik Weihenmayer a voice when he would have not normally been heard. Thank you Lucy for being true to your vison as a filmmaker.&#39;,
   &#34;This is an extraordinary film, that tricks you constantly. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles. It would give away too much to say much more, but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford&#39;s chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this sub-text subtlely and with great depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are very moving. And I never thought I could get so involved in a football match as I did in this movie - and I don&#39;t even understand the rules! Also excellent is Francis X. Bushman&#39;s son Ralph as Haines&#39; rival for the girl (yes, it&#39;s not completely a gay movie). Wonderful silent classic - a great example of Twenties commercial cinema with an edge.&#34;,
   &#39;A longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites. Bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. A literal rainbow of emotion and talent, Bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the &#34;Bette of Roses&#34; album. Spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone. The one and only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around.&#39;,
   &#34;An intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the Santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of Temuco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Film debutant Daniella Rios is the seductive erotic dancer Gracia, working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new mini-wave in Chilean film production, Alejandro Trejo. The elder brother, played maturely by Nestor Cantillana, is easily convinced to become Trejo&#39;s lead henchman, after a night at the stripclub to celebrate younger brother Victor&#39;s (Juan Pablo Miranda) seventeenth birthday. From the establishing shot of this opening scene, the film explodes into neo-noir exploration of everything the outside world doesn&#39;t usually expect to see in this country so stereotypically conservative and catholic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gracia&#39;s charms of seduction attract the three men like bees to honey, although the circular narrative of the three-way fantasy romance revolves around the linear portrayal of major international drug deals between Trejo&#39;s men and the &#39;Gringo&#39;, Eduardo Barril. Power relations become a vital theme, as society&#39;s outsiders merge in a mini-family. The prostitute holds an exotic spell over all the chilean men in the film, emerging from her ambiguous position in the periphery of society, and is seen as holding the key to all three men&#39;s futures. The relationships between Trejo and Cantillana become important, as the boys&#39; parents are conspicious by their absence (one assumes they still live in Temuco). Therefore it is Trejo, el padrino, who &#39;adopts&#39; Cantillana, and effectively &#39;makes him&#39; as a man in the city. Miranda rapidly becomes the desperate outsider, as his dependency on his &#39;father figure&#39;, Cantillana, becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful Gracia. However, Miranda remains trapped by the constraint of still being in school - he is dependent on Cantillana, who is dependent on Trejo, for the money to survive. Trejo, in turn, is under the thumb of the &#39;Gringo&#39;, and his wealth has been accumulated through drug deals and well as his strip clubs. The figure of Gracia acts as a time bomb viewed as a beautiful firework, she wraps a web of beauty inside the patriarchy but the strain can only lead to one climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the tensions of these power relations come to head, Gracia remains ambiguously elusive. The viewer is never sure which male figure she will commit to. The film concludes tragically and explosively in a shoot out which realigns power relations and erases half the major male protanganists. The final shot of Miranda&#39;s beaten face speeding down the PanAmericano highway is despairingly powerful. The boy has been sucked in by the lure of the city&#39;s underworld, yet has lost his only visible family, and his woman, who is his only friend in the film. He has nothing. The overriding metaphors are bold and brave. This is a gangster film in Chile. The notions of family, no sex before marriage etc, are abolished, and instead the harsh realities of the other side of Santiago&#39;s coin are displayed in all their savage glory. Trejo beats Rios brutally, Rios and Miranda make love in a cinema reel room - a whore having sex with a minor she barely knows. The &#39;gringos&#39; are seen to have a financial hold over this small Latin American nation, but not through the copper mines, through the illegal path of drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waissbluth&#39;s triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld, which raises so many social questions, more perhaps than the record-breakingly successful Sexo Con Amor, within a slick, smooth firecracker of a film, which place this film firmly alongside Sexo Con Amor, Taxi Para Tres, and El chacotero Sentimental, as cinematic evidence that Chile is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the post-transition period 15 years after the censorship of the Military Regime.&#34;,
   &#34;&#39;The Italian&#39; is among the great or near-great films of 1915 that are available today. The year was a turning point for the feature-length film, especially in America: Lois Weber&#39;s &#39;Hypocrites&#39;, Cecil B. DeMille&#39;s &#39;The Cheat&#39; and, of course, D.W. Griffith&#39;s &#39;The Birth of a Nation&#39; set new benchmarks for the art. Additionally, that year, Russian filmmaker Yevgeni Bauer made two of his best pictures, &#39;After Death&#39; and &#39;Daydreams&#39;. The French serial &#39;Les Vampires&#39; also has its admirers today, although I disagree with them. The emergence of the feature-length film was led by Europe, mainly Denmark, France and Italy, but dominance of this market and, to a degree, the art shifted to across the Atlantic in 1915.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most overriding artistic achievement of &#39;The Italian&#39; is its stunning and often innovative cinematography. There are some picturesque sunsets, mobile framing, including a brief overhead angled shot of the Italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car, and, in general, there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout. An especially amazing shot is a close-up of the Italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close-up, in reference to D.W. Griffith&#39;s &#39;Musketeers of Pig Alley&#39; (1912). He&#39;s so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the cinematographer appears to be unknown. The director, although originally without credit in the film, is now known to have been Reginald Barker. Five or so of his other films made for Ince are also available today, but are rather unremarkable. &#39;Civilization&#39; (1916), which he worked on, was a large production, but a deeply flawed movie. By the way, I&#39;d guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who worked on &#39;Civilization&#39; also photographed &#39;The Italian&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the entire production is very advanced for then. Venice and New York are well rendered despite the film being shot in Los Angeles (for romanticized Venice) and San Francisco (for the ethnic slums of New York). There are extensive flashbacks, although perhaps one or two too many. I especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor, George Beban, who is also the lead in the inner, main narrative. The reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes, à la the theatre, which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child&#39;s room, with the opening and closing of window curtains. Parallel editing, in-camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly. Additionally, Beban and Clara Williams, as his wife, play their parts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, &#39;The Italian&#39; does have a few drawbacks. The film&#39;s early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama, although the environmental changes from romanticized Italy to naturalistic New York works well\x97mostly because it&#39;s supported by the lighting and photography. The harsh dissolution of the American dream in this film, enhanced by the stark photography, must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie-going public back then. The Corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more; his brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for his later centrality to the Italian&#39;s revenge. In addition, the filmmakers were either medically naïf or careless to not explain the lack of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child. Aside from the deficiencies in plot, &#39;The Italian&#39; is exceptionally well made.&#34;,
   &#34;i LOVED IT and was SO shattered that there not making another season!!! i wish they would! it was the best show ever!!!!!! there&#39;s probably not any chance of them deciding to not cancel the show is there! ha ha i wish there was though! i would be so so excited!! i really would! I miss it! and was especially shattered not to know what happens to Jason!! i think they should make another one.... it i also think its silly that u have to writr ten lines to post a comment.. it makes your comment drag on..and no one will read it!! i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole... maybe they could make a spin off!!&#34;,
   &#34;This is the best movie I&#39;ve ever seen! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#39;s because I live just a few miles from the village were the story take place, and I know how things work out in this area in Sweden. The movie tells the truth, believe me! It both criticizes and honors the lifestyle of Dalarna, and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more opened minded and care more for your closest friends and relatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or another country) you will probably also recognize much from this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Maria Blom!&#34;,
   &#34;SPOILERS This is a gripping movie about grifters. But who is conning who here? When does the hunter turn into the prey? This gritty, dark movie is slow moving and seductive. It pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path, only to waylay you just as you think you are safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a riveting script, with good acting (at least from the leads). I didn&#39;t notice the background music, but it was never jarring, so it must have been done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised that I liked this movie, because I don&#39;t usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end.&#34;,
   &#34;It is not an easy film to watch - it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations. Yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character, that it is, in my humble opinion, one of the very greatest films of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something uplifting, see Jacques Rivette&#39;s fantastic Céline and Julie Go Boating, which was made around the same time). It shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It involves a supposedly liberated ménage-à-trois between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). Yet Alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. The women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors of the New Wave, having starred (among other films) in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) by Francois Truffaut as a rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave, but he should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no improvisation (unlike in John Cassavetes&#39;s similar films made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film is resonant with Eustache&#39;s personal experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character Marie was based on, did too. The anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by Veronika delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film. This mesmerising, personal, and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around.&#34;,
   &#34;Don&#39;t think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it. Its a strange mix of a movie, as its seems to have a movie within it, but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films!) It does give you all the elements of a film (decent plot, good characters - well it does star the Muppets, a list of lesser celebs* which films would clamour for) What is surprising, is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some heartwarming, some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine Miss Piggy!!!!&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain that I have ever seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a match maid in heaven. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was great as the Blue Raja, and I especially loved that the character wasn\&#39;t really British. The scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes. I loved the fact that The Bowler talked to the ball. Some of the funniest stuff involved Stiller and his character Mr. Furious\&#39;s false rage, and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish, and that they never made any sense. I could barely stop myself from applauding when he said &#34;fraculater, Freinken-puss,&#34; was said. But one of the things I most enjoyed was that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie. I HIGHLY recommend this film for any occasion, and I give it my own personal two-thumbs-up.&#39;,
   &#34;Another powerful chick flick. This time, it revolves around Diana Gusman who is always getting into fights at school. Instead of getting expelled, she takes her anger elsewhere, to the boxing ring. She trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone doesn&#39;t believe in you (in this case, her dad doesn&#39;t believe in her). That alone makes the movie worth the price. Enjoy&#34;,
   &#39;After gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex-rental DVDs, I figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than Sam Mendes? For a number of reasons, &#34;American Beauty&#34; doesn\&#39;t appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade. For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins, and is simply wonderful to watch because of it. And despite my usual allergy to any film with Tom Hanks\&#39; name on it (still can\&#39;t watch &#34;Big&#34; without wanting a cat to kick), I\&#39;m glad I gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you\&#39;ll kick yourself for if you miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally squeaky-clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930\&#39;s. He is also a professional hit-man to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons. But after his eldest (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing, the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up. Soon, father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit-man (a menacing Jude Law) is waiting for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the face of it, it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as I\&#39;ve said, this isn\&#39;t really about gangsters at all. It\&#39;s about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances. Hanks is (*grits teeth*) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little Hoechlin is also good as Sullivan\&#39;s son. In all honesty, there is not a single performance that I could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless. As is the cinematography and costumes (and it\&#39;s not often I praise costumes!) which recreates the 30\&#39;s with stunning effect. There has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades. This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30\&#39;s look was difficult to put down - but it doesn\&#39;t and that deserves every bit of credit. Chicago especially looks fantastic, lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats. True time-travel, even if a little CGI is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is also a winner, offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain. Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you don\&#39;t have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster. The film is decidedly noir-ish, driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are (finally) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts. The whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the Tommy-Gun shootouts and extortion rackets. It can feel a little slow in places, especially if you\&#39;re used to masses of gun-play in movies like most modern audiences (like yours truly) but sometimes, words can speak louder than actions. Mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his Oscar-winning debut, a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch. &#34;Road To Perdition&#34; may not be to everyone\&#39;s tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon.&#39;,
   &#34;The arrival of an world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change. This movie is heartwarming and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It&#39;a about bringing out the best in people and Kay Pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for. The actors are outstanding, Michael Nyqvist we know before but Frida Hallgren was an new, and charming acquaintances to me. She has a most vivid face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella&#39;s husband almost too well, he is awful too see. One only wish the at he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you haven&#39;t already seen it, do it today!&#34;,
   &#39;One the whole, this movie isn\&#39;t perfect. It doesn\&#39;t \&#39;hang well\&#39; together as the story line is basically a bunch of hooks to hang jokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these jokes are a little \&#39;too 80s\&#39; and tend to date the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But some of these jokes are classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know a movie has something special when you and your friends still reference silly quotes from it over 2 decades later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, there are a bunch of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne, and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., the Skipper from Gilligan\&#39;s Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are some great absurdist moments, like when Johnny is labelling the puppies with a pricing gun, or the Pope making an appearance in Johnny\&#39;s neighborhood. Also, the scene where the fake priest makes up a lot of words in Latin is excellent. (&#34;Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio\&#39;s too louda... Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Classic Scenes include Ramone Maroney butchering the English language Danny Devito urging Griffin Dunne to \&#39;Play Ball\&#39; Peter Boyle thinking he lost his manhood The fake VD movie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is no home run. But like \&#39;Porky\&#39;s\&#39;, it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable.&#39;,
   &#34;One of the best records of Israel&#39;s response to the murder of Rabin.Extremely true and natural, it captured the spirit of the nation.Especially important was the response of young people to the trauma of Israel&#39;s loss and the feeling that we shall overcome.&#34;,
   &#34;Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film. After seeing it for the first time I&#39;m glad to say that it doesn&#39;t disappoint. On the contrary, you get your time&#39;s worth, which means (as to what Miyazaki&#39;s films are concern), that is nothing less than excellent! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produced early in his cinematic career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting (and some times lovable) supporting characters. And, of course, the usual battle of nature versus civilization, flying machines (lots of it!!), beautiful painted sceneries \x85 but alas, no pigs ( at least that i&#39;ve noticed, after all I have only seen it once). Never the less, Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausicãa, which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his TV series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes. In here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy working in a little countryside mining town. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from, whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates. As the movie progresses, the plot gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at his best. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away, (or vice versa, as Castle in the sky was produced first), and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ starts with a very light score, that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note to the English dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although Anna Paquin&#39;s Sheeta has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at that point in her career), and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska, making up for a delighting yet devilish villain! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t miss this one people!&#34;,
   &#39;What can you say about the film White Fire. Amazing? Fantastic? Disturbing? Hilarious? These words are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire. From wobbly, garbled beginning to profound end, this movie will entertain throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world. A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. When the father separates from the mother and their childen, you get a real sense of what kind of movie you\&#39;re about to watch. Father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit, and is polite as he gets people\&#39;s attention before he shoots them, but alas, dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised, unsafe stunt. Meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them. He too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre &#34;HALT!&#34;, and then promptly wastes the mother. This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now we fast forward about 20 years (30 if you\&#39;re honest about the hero\&#39;s age) to beautiful Turkey, where Bo and Ingred have settled as professional thieves, or diamond prospectors, or something. Ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods, while Bo (masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty) drives around the desert in his denim outfits. Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship. They don\&#39;t seem to have any friends other than each other, and they spend all of their time together. That coupled with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as &#34;you know its a shame you\&#39;re my sister&#34; he says to her while she\&#39;s stark naked, make for a very dynamic duo. Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed, as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid, and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid. This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. Bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas, and he is overjoyed with his new love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, there\&#39;s a lot of fun action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, impossible to follow plot-lines, Fred &#34;the hammer&#34; Williamson (for some reason), and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes). All of these things are great, but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire. You may be glad you did..or not.&#39;,
   &#39;the town of Royston Vasey is a weird, but wonderful place. The characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works, and it works very well. Most people will know others with a touch of some characters, but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as Tubbs and Edward, the stranger-hating owners of the local shop, or the pen-obsessed Pauline who treats &#34;dole scum&#34; with much contempt.That was only a few of the strange inhabitants. The TV works consists of 3 series and a Christmas special. There are references to many horror films, such as the wicker man. A more recent addition to the range of works is a film, the league of gentlemens apocalypse, of which I will not say much but highly recommend. All in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters. I would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it!&#39;,
   &#34;I have seen this film many times and I like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films. However, I do think that this is one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy. It is I would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched. The script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other comments. The two leads give extraordinary performances, the girls are superb and the situations are side-splittingly funny. Not one swear-word in sight (mark that Hollywood, you don&#39;t have to swear to be funny, you have to be witty) and the move from stage to film is seamless. They don&#39;t make&#39;em like this any more. Timeless.&#34;,
   &#34;After several extremely well ratings to the point of SUPERB, I was extremely pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, the anger, the pain, the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had initially expected to see many special effects, and like a lover&#39;s caress, it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it. Brian, I am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric Etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya. :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the acting, story line, the high quality filming and awesome effects, it was fantastic. I just wish it were longer. I am looking forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.&#34;,
   &#34;I have seen this movie. This movie is the best according today&#39;s need. Dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays. In stating this problem this movie is the best. In this movie, the Indian values are stated very well. Today&#39;s youth must understand this problem. There is less population of girls. And due to this problem of dowry , the girls committed suicide. If this problem continues, then the day when there is no girl child, is not far away.So, keep in mind this statement ,today&#39;s youth must understand that we can not take dowry in marriages.We have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be taken.And if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society. This is the major change in the society.&#34;,
   &#39;For animation buffs it\&#39;s a must, but even general audiences will enjoy THE CAMERAMAN\&#39;S REVENGE, a very early example of \&#39;pixilation\&#39; by the hard-working pioneer Wladyslaw Starewicz. Starewicz and his helpers painstakingly manipulated a cast of flexible insect figures to tell this story, paving the way for the likes of Willis O\&#39;Brien, George Pal, Ray Harryhausen, and legions of modern digital effect creators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CAMERAMAN\&#39;S REVENGE is only about 10 minutes long, but packs in lots of amusing detail as the story follows the amorous adventures of two beetles from their home to a nightclub, a hotel, a cinema, and, eventually, a prison cell. There are two brief dance numbers at the nightclub (performed by a frog and a dragonfly), a scuffle between a beetle and a grasshopper, and a large-scale donnybrook at the cinema, which ends with the projector bursting into flames. Pretty elaborate goings-on for 1912, when even John Bray and Winsor MacCay were just getting started, and Walt Disney was still in grade school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s interesting to note, too, what an impact the alteration of a silent movie\&#39;s title cards can have on the story being told. I\&#39;ve seen two versions of this film offered by two video companies, and watched them back-to-back, and although the image content itself is almost identical, two different sets of intertitles tell two very different stories. (And the plot outline someone provided above tells yet a third story, which suggests that there\&#39;s another version out there somewhere.) The British Film Institute\&#39;s print, which has rhyming intertitles, tells the story of two sibling beetles, each secretly married, who hide this information from one another in order to inherit their late father\&#39;s fortune. The other, Russian print, tells a simpler story of married beetles who are each guilty of infidelity. In the Russian version Mr. Beetle visits his girlfriend at the &#34;Gay Dragonfly&#34; nightclub, while in the English version brother Bill Beetle visits his wife at the music-hall. Personally, I prefer the straightforward-- and spicier --Russian story; the BFI version tries to cram too much plot into what should be a simple tale, and some of the rhymes are a bit awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, in any rendition, THE CAMERAMAN\&#39;S REVENGE is a delightful film, and would make an ideal lead-in to that other great animated work which features beetles, YELLOW SUBMARINE.&#39;,
   &#39;The pre-release version of 1933\&#39;s &#34;Baby Face&#34; would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment. Mentored by a Nietszchean professor, Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father\&#39;s speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank. Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault, the film has no victims, except Lily\&#39;s childhood, which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father. The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily\&#39;s hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate. While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach, the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancés to trade jobs for sexual favors. Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930\&#39;s owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot moves fast, and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the façade of the office building as Lily climbs ever higher. Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hard-bitten roles, and she is in top form here. Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. Only her African-American confidante, Chico, receives Lily\&#39;s affection, trust, and loyalty. In more enlightened times, the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris, who plays Chico, would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her. Stanwyck often appears overly made-up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris. However, despite Stanwyck\&#39;s tough demeanor, obvious tactics, and artificial visage, she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men, including Douglass Dumbrille, Donald Cook, and a young John Wayne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The preferred version of &#34;Baby Face&#34; is the 76-minute restored cut. The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts, which the longer cut restores and makes explicit. Perhaps Darryl Zanuck, who wrote the story under an assumed name, intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche, whose views on women were controversial. However, despite Alphonse Ethier\&#39;s lectures and advice not to be defeated by life, Lily\&#39;s grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor. However, the philosophy is but a distraction. Short, fast paced, and entertaining, &#34;Baby Face&#34; is as contemporary in its morality as &#34;Wall Street.&#34; Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche, and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be &#34;greed is good.&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;When the Bourne Identity arrived five years ago I have to confess that I didn&#39;t think much of it. At the time I was eleven years old, so perhaps I was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario. Two years ago when the Bourne Supremacy arrived I thought it was a better movie than Identity but still didn&#39;t think it was as good as I expected it to be judging by the trailers. Over the past two years I had been told numerous times that the Bourne movies were amazing, many a time I had to bite my tongue and not say what I really thought about the movies. Until two months ago I couldn&#39;t have given a damn about the Bourne Ultimatum, I really had no intentions of watching it. But then I decided to go back and re-watch the first two before I came to any abrupt decisions. So I went out and bought both the original movies. And what a surprise it was to me when I was gripped by them. Identity I found the superior of the two, but Supremacy isn&#39;t far behind. They&#39;re both slick, action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that I have watched numerous times since I bought them. Because of this I was first in line today to see the Bourne Ultimatum. And boy did Bourne Ultimatum not disappoint! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt Damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the Bourne movies, I&#39;d seen him in the Talented Mr Ripley, but I never thought much of him in general. However, it appears he was born to play Bourne (pardon the pun). Throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes, in this movie we see Matt Damon at his very best, even better than he was in The Departed and I thought he was one of the best things in The Departed. You really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything. Matt Damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable. The supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding. Joan Allen was one of my favourite things in Bourne Supremacy, here she excels herself. Her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie. Julia Stiles turns up again as Nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character. Julia Stiles is a very underrated actress and I think she deserves a lot more roles, well decent roles, than she gets. David Strathairn is a newcomer to this series as Noah Vosen, he&#39;s definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels. He&#39;s definitely the nastiest character we&#39;ve met, and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty. Strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie. Special mention must also go to Albert Finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time, I will not say anything about the character, that&#39;s best left as a surprise, but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences, this isn&#39;t to say the trilogy lacks action sequences, good god no there&#39;s loads of them dotted all throughout the movies. But running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline. This storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie. As I watched Supremacy the night before I saw Ultimatum it was nice because I could notice certain little parts. That very final scene in Supremacy, in New York, a lot more important that I ever imagined at the time. Won&#39;t spoil it for people but I recommend checking up on Supremacy before you see Ultimatum. Unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see Ultimatum purely because of the action sequences. This is the part where I should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline, but I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t say that my favourite parts of the Bourne series as a whole are the car chases. The mini car chase in Identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time. Well the action in Ultimatum has to be the best of the Bourne series. In fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in Moscow. So in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups, all very violent and shockingly brutal. A bike chase that is absolutely amazing, many foot chases which are even more amazing, a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable, and oh so much more! But the highlight for me has to be the scene in Waterloo station, won&#39;t ruin it but for some reason had me gripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So any flaws for the movie? In my eyes no, but if you are not a fan of the Bourne series or have not seen the previous two then I wouldn&#39;t recommend Ultimatum for you. The movie doesn&#39;t try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top. The Bourne Ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007. As a James Bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that Ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the Bond movies, and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that. While Bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the Bond series, it is definitely nearly its equal.&#34;,
   &#34;Having seen most of Ringo Lam&#39;s films, I can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual. It&#39;s a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the set design is truely memorable. Sadly, Burning Paradise has not been made available on DVD and vhs is next-to-impossible to get your mitts on, even if you near the second biggest china-town in North America (like I do). If you can find it, don&#39;t pass it up.&#34;,
   &#39;When this first came out, my dad brought it home- we were amazed by it- It was so different from anything we had seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night, and I found &#34;The Mind\&#39;s Eye&#34; again. The box is falling apart, and I am surprised that the tape still works! Although it is not \&#39;Finding Nemo\&#39; quality graphics, it is still very good. They should sell this again- it is a landmark for computer animation imagery. Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Mind\&#39;s Eye&#34; is a spectacular odyssey through time. Your journey begins at the dawn of creation and moves through the rise of man and technology. Travel in the world of abstraction and on into the future with breathtaking computer animation imagery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Mind\&#39;s Eye&#34; joins the imaginations of over 300 of the world\&#39;s most talented computer animation artists with a powerful, original music soundtrack. This unique collaboration takes you on an incredible voyage into &#34;The Mind\&#39;s Eye.&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;well i wasn&#39;t sure what the film was going to be like as i had only seen a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my favourite film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think Alison Lohan played the part of beth really well she is such a grate actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has 2 Horus observation after meals because iv been told like 1 house is OK and also that hospitals doesn&#39;t help bulimics as iv been told which is probably why I&#39;m still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person&#34;,
   &#34;Absolutely hilarious. John Waters&#39; tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at. It&#39;s like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch! I haven&#39;t laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom. I loved seeing old friends from the Dreamland days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of Waters&#39; camera. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Uses the best elements of past Waters atrocities (especially the underrated Polyester) and plenty of new surprises. Made me sick, in a wonderful way. Thanks, John!&#34;,
   &#39;As a grownup in my mid-40s, I am not even close to any of &#34;Nancy Drew&#34;\&#39;s key demographics, but I was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon; so, I could tell, were the pair of sixtyish silver-haired ladies down the row from me. The older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20-ish female usher (who said she\&#39;d seen the film the previous evening and quite liked it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to the point, however: In the row just ahead of me, there were nine -- count them, nine -- ten-year-old girls lined up next to each other, passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the film began, they promptly settled down to watch....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....and didn\&#39;t so much as peep till the closing credits began to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a perfect film; it doesn\&#39;t quite pay off its high school subplots, it\&#39;s not quite confident enough of its own tone, and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward critically inept at times. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot hangs together fairly well, and it treads deftly between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts carries the movie with startling grace -- Josh Flitter\&#39;s superb timing notwithstanding, this is Roberts\&#39; movie, and she pulls it off beautifully. Her Nancy Drew is very much the direct ancestor of Kristen Bell\&#39;s Veronica Mars, and the film is also a lineal descendant of Jodie Foster\&#39;s early and underrated &#34;Candleshoe&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In today\&#39;s marketplace, it\&#39;s a rarity: a family movie that respects its viewers\&#39; intelligence. As such, it won\&#39;t be to everyone\&#39;s taste -- but for what it is, it is the best movie of its kind in decades.&#39;,
   &#34;It&#39;s not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh, and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears. Many movies try to do this, but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did. Adam Sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts, but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn&#39;t pulling him down. I&#39;m not going to ruin anything, but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering. Even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but is out-shined by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in the line of the two leading roles. Sandler&#39;s humor is still present, which actually saved this film from being border-line depressing. There are several laughs to be had, but don&#39;t think you will stay there long, because it gets serious again without much warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains, but I will cut this one short. I feel there is no need to tell you anything more. Do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait until it comes out on DVD, it&#39;s 100% worth the time. A deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face...unless of course...you are a heartless soul.&#34;,
   &#34;An inventive, suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms. Not completely successful, but taut, surprising and well-acted. One might find the film somewhat reminiscent of SAW \x96 two men trapped in room and pitting against each other \x96 but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film. It&#39;s like watching a lab experiment. Some might find the contained suspense tedious, but this reviewer found it enthralling. The sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized. This is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system. Just right for a late night movie fest, when one is in the paranoid mood. It certainly kept me awake that night.&#34;,
   &#34;Ed Harris&#39;s work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it, and that includes the formidable Sean Connery. The movie, which is more than a bit sanctimonious, comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict. It is breathtaking, a master class in artistic control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other cast members are all adept and Connery is reliable, as is Fishbourne, but the story itself packs no wallop. The plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers. This is the engine which drives the story, right or wrong, and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, worth watching to see Harris in action.&#34;,
   &#34;First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you&#39;ll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. His character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. The story begins in the (not so far) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go towards SF but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. About that. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you&#39;ll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. Its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. But that doesn&#39;t mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. As far as the direction goes, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. So, if you are getting ready to see a Sci-Fi movie or some action, you&#39;ll miss it. B There should be more movies like this.&#34;,
   &#34;this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young, it had everything that was great with 90&#39;s kids movies... lovable dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain, and a few great songs (and not the typical little mermaid/beauty and the beast type songs, but ones that are atually entertaining)! i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever! i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie, and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations! sorry not the most informative, i&#39;m in kinda a rush... just please, trust me. all who go against this movie are killing their inner child!&#34;,
   &#39;I loved this series when it was on Kids WB, I didn\&#39;t believe that there was a Batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all I loved the idea of Robin leaving Batman to solve crime on his own. It was an interesting perspective to their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and once again like it\&#39;s predecessor this show had great story lines, great animation (better then the original), fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing. The only thing that I didn\&#39;t like was that was when it was in the US it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline. I just wish some of the episodes could be longer. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoons comes in this series, and it\&#39;s called &#34;Over the Edge&#34;, in my opinion as good if not better then &#34;Heart of Ice&#34; and &#34;Robin\&#39;s reckoning.&#34; Overall a nice follow up, along with Superman this show made my childhood very happy.&#39;,
   &#39;FULL OF SPOILERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin\&#39;s play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) that plot the murder of one\&#39;s rich wife (Cannon) to get the property and the insurance. The plot succeeds but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder -- with only slight changes in the details. Reeve allows that Easthampton, Long Island, can become Southampton, Long Island, in the script, for instance. The rest of the play\&#39;s plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth Reeve doesn\&#39;t mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into Cannon\&#39;s apparently accidental death. It will boost the revenues and his own Warhol quotient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, the megabucks-making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play, perhaps with Reeve\&#39;s input, that would redeem his reputation. He cannot permit Reeve\&#39;s scandalous play-a-clef to be produced. So -- what else? -- he tries to murder him. In the end they wind up killing one another, the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp, and she makes a million bucks selling it to Broadway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a lot of fun for a number of reasons. One is the production design. That multi-roomed, multi-storied house with the big windmill atop, situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!) would be a splendid set of digs anywhere. You wouldn\&#39;t be able to afford a pup tent in Easthamptom. The house is not overly large or baroque in its decor. It\&#39;s just magnificently modest, although it\&#39;s a little tidy for my tastes, the kind of house that\&#39;s so clean you\&#39;re afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the acting could hardly be improved upon. Caine, Cannon, and Fred Jones are superb. Dyan Cannon gives a pitch-perfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if they\&#39;d been sprayed on, which is okay given her assets. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer. Irene Worth, as the psychic neighbor Helga, was in some way hard to define, a mistake. Granted she -- or someone like her -- was necessary to the plot, but, my God, what an offensive snoop her character is, going around and claiming, &#34;I feel pain in zis woom!&#34; I suppose in order to make her a little more interesting, she\&#39;s got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it. Still, she\&#39;s a nuisance from beginning to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to love Ira Levin\&#39;s bitchy dialog. The distraught Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell-all play. &#34;Because it\&#39;s THERE, Sidney!&#34; says Reeve, and Caine shouts, &#34;That\&#39;s MOUNTAINS, not PLAYS! Plays aren\&#39;t there until some ***hole WRITES them!&#34; Great too is Caine\&#39;s call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright, as planned. He works himself up into a torrent of sobs, barely able to speak, as he reports the incident and implores that an ambulance be sent immediately. When he hangs up, his face assumes its usual placid expression, he blows his nose into his handkerchief, and walks away, all business again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The climax, though suitably ironic, is confusing and noisy and full of artifice, lacking in the wicked charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the earlier scenes. The score is mostly made up of light-hearted riffs on the harpsichord, neatly fitting into the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You\&#39;ll probably enjoy it.&#39;,
   &#39;This episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender bending angle.I imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to appease censors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story itself is original and well written and the directing is complemented by the fine acting.(Nicholas Lea makes his X-Files debut though not as Agent Krycek but as a victim called Michael) I especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its different but enjoyable.Ignore any bad reviews you may hear.Watch it for yourself and make judgement then&#39;,
   &#39;This is an excellent modern-day film noir....&#34;excellent&#34; in that it\&#39;s interesting, start-to-finish. There are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief.....but I haven\&#39;t found anyone who didn\&#39;t get caught up in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I labeled this crime movie a &#34;film noir&#34; because it\&#39;s gritty and the all the characters are no good. Even the only supposed-good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should\&#39;t have. He also does something at the end which isn\&#39;t right, but I\&#39;m not going the spoil it by saying. Suffice to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of &#34;bad guys,&#34; does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the &#34;deranged&#34; category, he\&#39;s tough to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another great supporting performance, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those films that never got much publicity, but it should have. You\&#39;ll have fun watching this. By the way, try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up!&#39;,
   &#39;Otto Preminger, completing a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, reunited his &#34;Laura&#34; leads for this stark, gritty detective drama. Dana Andrews again portrays a cop, but this time he\&#39;s hardened, cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior - &#34;You don\&#39;t hate hoods, you liked to beat them up!&#34;. Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises criminals, as his own father was a crook. He doesn\&#39;t want to be &#34;Sandy Dixon\&#39;s kid&#34; so he became a policeman, but his methods are harsh and hated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night, investigating a murder, he unknowingly punches a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so hard that it kills him. A shaken Dixon does his best to cover it up, intending to frame a hated thug, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the blame falls on Paine\&#39;s father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, department store model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes. Paine had slapped his wife, enraging her father, who did show up at his son-in-law\&#39;s apartment, but not until Dixon had departed with the body. With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riddled with guilt, Mark falls for Morgan and offers money for an attorney. He decides to take on Scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything. In the end, he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done, and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes her love for Mark and will wait for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great to find this film on DVD, after so many years of televised obscurity. Eddie Mueller, a film noir historian, provides the commentary and does a good job, but I find his assertion that audiences wouldn\&#39;t have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads, since &#34;Laura&#34; had been made six years earlier. In that respect, he is mistaken because they had appeared in &#34;The Iron Curtain&#34; two years prior to WTSE and the film was a box-office success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrews and Tierney were fabulous together, and Ruth Donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner Martha, fanning the flames between the detective and the dame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night cityscapes give the film an air of menace. Gary Merrill is great as the low-life Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon\&#39;s dad (&#34;Your father liked me,&#34; he taunts Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville Brand are terrific also. And Tom Tully is just touching and funny as Morgan\&#39;s unjustly accused pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A watchable film noir with a fantastic cast.&#39;,
   &#39;No rubbish - no where even near rubbish. Not an original? thats the last thing that could be said of &#34;2.4 children&#34;.Predictable? certainly not! Although it was somewhat an unusual series for the BBC, it was hilarious, funny, and witty. I particularly liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - who I believe preformed wonderfully.Gary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members..I never quite new why it was can-celled till reading here today about Gary Olsen\&#39;s death at a relatively young age. I do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type, much more of them (and show them here in Israel).Thumbs way up!&#39;,
   &#34;Well, if you are one of those Katana&#39;s film-nuts (just like me) you sure will appreciate this metaphysical Katana swinging blood spitting samurai action flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starring Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) &amp; Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between Heiki&#39;s clan versus Genji&#39;s clan touch the zenith in the final showdown at Gojo bridge. The body-count is countless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Demons, magic swords, Shinto priests versus Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good Japanese flick for a rainy summer night.&#34;,
   &#34;Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80&#39;s. It&#39;s a movie that breaths through amazing acting and a very interesting directing touch. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema can find things to relate on. The screenplay is very compelling and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the greatest performances up to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero superbly making us feel his broken heart in each line, in each move. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances in his career. Jacknife is never getting boring as it shows its heroes clear of any typical Hollywood&#39;s typical character elements. After the war none is a hero. Everybody is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. None can mend up his pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates. Simply magnificent movie.&#34;,
   &#34;The movie is absolutely silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But were you expecting a high-brow intellectual film based on a comic called Slam Dunk? Really? Jay Chou&#39;s acting isn&#39;t exactly the most moving thing I&#39;ve ever seen, but I certainly enjoyed the movie. Was it somewhere near the level of awesome that someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow can produce? No, not really. Was it thoroughly entertaining if you&#39;re just taking it at surface value? Absolutely. It&#39;s a movie about some Chinese eye-candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an unreal level of expertise. There&#39;s an evil Triad-style dude and a wacky scheming guy who gets Jay Chou involved in all of this. A love interest. It&#39;s formulaic but really, suspend disbelief for a while. Come on. It&#39;s called Kung Fu Dunk. What do you really think you signed on for? Do yourself a favor if you watch it - I found myself a copy with some Engrish subtitles that made the movie nigh unintelligible conversation wise, but we got a great laugh out of it. They would appear to be extremely fixated on Jerusalem and the numbers 1, 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laughed, I cried, I hurled. I&#39;d watch it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially for that fight scene in the bar. Well choreographed and well shot. I especially enjoy the plexiglass lit pool table - I&#39;d LOVE to play on one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slick enough for me, but I dig on trash cinema.&#34;,
   &#34;The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder, one simply cannot go wrong. The very plot in itself, the very story and essence of the film, is entertaining. It is the sort of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do so much with, and in this case, he really did do a lot with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creativity that is behind this story is first class. I felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls -- the action flowing neatly, quickly, and tightly from one scene to the next. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It demonstrates just how far people can go: so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones, and to do such acts of evil, in the name of &#39;God&#39; when they are disillusioned as in this case. It also is sometimes interesting in its&#39; twists &amp; takes on the concept of morality as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks, but I would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out -- it is very much so worth your time.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;THINGS TO COME&#34; Movie Review by kWRice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place. It is a film I\&#39;ve only seen in truncated parts, but Art should be taken as a whole. I experienced this film as it was designed, in a darkened theatre, on a silver screen, with whirling reels of film and an audience to share it with. That audience and myself were effected by this film! One woman who lived through WW II was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive, albeit corny, ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits. The first thing we see is &#34;H.G. Wells&#34; in bold angular block copy much like the &#34;Superman&#34; of yore. It is not the film title, but the creator\&#39;s title, and then before any other humans, such as actors or production, are listed, the director William Cameron Menzies is up there! Who? You\&#39;ve probably seen his work before, &#34;Around the World in 80 Days,&#34; &#34;Pride of the Yankees,&#34; and &#34;Gone With the Wind.&#34; He did not direct after this Sci-Fi epic opera he and Mr. Wells created, but his film imagery, sets, and design are very recognizable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That imagery is very effecting. I recognized images from many other films, that have paid homage to this classic. The recent &#34;Hitchhiker\&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy&#34; is obvious, along with Bugs Bunny, &#34;Fantasia,&#34; &#34;Monty Python and the Holy Grail,&#34; &#34;Sky Captain &amp; the World of Tomorrow,&#34; &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; and more that I know of, but which titles escape me. This is real special effects here, scenes now done with CGI are done with actors, big sets, and detailed models. This film was made in 1936, and it\&#39;s obvious it meant something to the other auteurs. Wells and Menzies also worked with Bliss, doing the music, and Korda, the producer, to create a masterpiece with message, warning, and sermon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lines the Shakespearean actors Cedric Hardwicke, Ralph Richardson and Raymond Massey speak, sometimes sound preachy, but I also heard lines I still hear now. &#34;These toys children have nowadays are nothing like I had when I was child,&#34; &#34;It\&#39;ll help develop their coordination,&#34; &#34;What do we need books for, what do we need to read for?&#34;, &#34;We don\&#39;t need cars, there\&#39;s nowhere to go, we have all we need right here,&#34; &#34;There will be no war.&#34; But war there is! The naive citizens of &#34;Everytown&#34; refuse to see the literal writing on the wall. The never-ending war explodes Christmas eve. The little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me. This is the world of 1936 that wore blinders to Hitler\&#39;s appeasement. This war does not end. The poison gas of the aerial wars segues into the second act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is another dark age. No government, no services, and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about. Plague, warlords and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists. Loved ones are shot in the street, before they can carry the plague to another. Midway there is a marvelous vignette about the Rolls Royce, that is a much needed respite mid-way. Into this lands a futuristic plane that heralds the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That future is the third act. The world has rebuilt itself with the help of that &#34;puny animal, man.&#34; Helicopters fly in this film, before they were even invented. The Plumber\&#39;s Helper has other uses than the Dalek\&#39;s or Glenn Miller\&#39;s. Wide screen plasma screens beguiling the masses, and orators inciting the people to tear it all down. &#34;Beware the concussion, you have been warned!&#34;, the city father warns the riotous populace. So be warned, this film might hit you like it hit me. There are some cute miscues and miscalculations, but the thought provoking idealism is what is really worth pondering again, and I do want to see this artful film again. Others criticize Mr. Wells vision. It is very easy to work with 20/20 hindsight regarding things, costumes and foley miscues. I believe Mr. Wells\&#39; &#34;Things to Come&#34; is not about things, but is actually about concepts, social trends, and philosophical ideals. Besides, we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come. This is not cheap cardboard British Science Fiction, but worthwhile Epic Filmed Opera, sans singing, that as a whole concept overcomes some minor dated shortcomings.&#39;,
   &#39;The quintessential Georgian film of Georgi Danelia, Ne goryuy (1969) aka Don\&#39;t Grieve is loosely based on the novel by French writer Claude Tillier (1801-1844) &#34;Mon oncle Benjamin&#34; The novel takes place in the country side of the 18th Century France. The Great French Revolution is still ahead but some of its stormy signs are present in society. Benjamin, the local doctor is a soul of a local society, the educated, friendly, democratic person who often treats the poor for free. It makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account. He is in love with a beautiful Manette who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter &#34;his small capital&#34; and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed... I never read the book, and from description it sounds like a charming very French novel but I am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from 18th Century France to the beginning of 20th century Georgia-Grusiya. I would think that it was Danelia who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native Georgia-Grusiya, the land of long and wonderful traditions, including Art of making and drinking wine, rare music talent that all Georgians seem to possess, very unique humor, and high code of honor. When we watched the film last night together with my husband, he said, what a great example of an Art film, and I so agree with him. Don\&#39;t Grieve is a perfect Art movie, visually beautiful, deep but funny, at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic, celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness, full of interest, loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters. What is the most important, the film is warm and gentle, it does not look down at its viewers as some of the Art pictures do. You don\&#39;t have to be a movie buff to love it, to live with it, to smile and sigh at it, to follow the good-hearted young Doctor Benjamin (first role in a Danelia film of famous singer and actor Wachtang Kikabidze with whom Danelia would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites, Mimino) on his journey through the roads and mountains of Georgia. Or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor Levan who wanted to be a guest on his own wake, to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive, and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin. When I watched the film I thought that it is a sort of movie that Federico Fellini might have liked. I was not surprised at all to find the article about Danelia where he names Fellini his number one director. I also found out that according Danelia, the famous Soviet directors, Leonid Gaiday (the creator of many beloved comedies) and Sergei Paraszhanov (the visionary whom I don\&#39;t have to introduce loved another Danelia\&#39;s film, fairy tale about American boy Huck Finn, Sovsem propashchiy) felt and spoke negatively about Don\&#39;t Grieve while Fellini praised it highly. I dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps Maestro Fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of Don\&#39;t Grieve when he was making Amrarcord in 1973. Just a thought, because there is something essential that connects both films. Both Artists came back to their roots, to the places that they love deeply, to the people they remembered, loved and wanted to honor. Both films have a lot of smiles through the tears. Both are Art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers. Both are masterworks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to add Georgi Danelia to the list of my favorite directors. He has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of dramedy, even tragicomedies that are funny and bitter sweet, poignant and subtle, earthy and uplifting, gentle and shining. When I looked up the list of the movies he has written/directed, I was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in 1960 with the Award winning story of a young boy, Seryozha. Many of Danelia\&#39;s films are among my favorites, as I am sure they are among his legions of fans. The man behind \&#39;Seryozha, Sovsem propashchiy (1972) which is an adaptation of Mark Twain The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, 33, Ya shagayu po Moskve (1964) aka Walking the Streets of Moscow, Ne goryuy (1969) aka Don\&#39;t grieve, Afonya (1975), Mimino (1977), Osenniy marafon (1979) aka Autumn Marathon or Sad Comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that Danelia practically invented, and the cult favorite for over 20 years Kin-Dza-Dza (1986), is brilliant and deserves our true love and genuine gratitude for the unforgettable moments of cinematic happiness.&#39;,
   &#34;A bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm. The police have closed the bridge--saying it&#39;s unsafe and they are stuck in a little café until the road has been cleared. However, after a while, their boredom is turned to concern, as it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and may just be an alien!! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a low-brow way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another of the fun episodes of The Twilight Zone. Instead of the typical twists or social commentary, this one features no lasting message. However, it&#39;s also very and watchable, so who cares?! Exactly WHAT occurs you&#39;ll just have to see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this one stars John Hoyt--a face most of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost every case, he played a real grouch (like Charles Lane during the same era), but boy did I love seeing him--as he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time.&#34;,
   &#39;I also saw this upon its release in \&#39;56, and have been struck since then with its final scene. If this is an answer to \&#39;High Noon,\&#39; then it\&#39;s an apt and apposite response. The notion that, as this string is headed, &#34;The town comes together&#34; is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of \&#39;High Noon.\&#39; In this theme, \&#39;Concho\&#39; is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all-time favorites, \&#39;The Magnificent Seven.\&#39; Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra\&#39;s transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years I\&#39;ve inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.&#39;,
   &#34;Picture Bride has an excellent look into Hawaii&#39;s past and the people who lived there in that time. The time, money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live, takes a whole new meaning to blood, sweat and tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept of dating/matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net. Just that is more of snail mail. Very slow snail mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The singing of the plantation&#39;s songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers&#39; songs of their demise and future goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring. Like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility.&#34;,
   &#39;Once upon a time in a castle...... Two little girls are playing in the garden\&#39;s castle. They are sisters. A blonde little girl (Kitty) and a brunette one (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty\&#39;s doll. Kitty pursues Evelyn. Running through long corridors, they reach the room where their grandfather, sitting on an armchair, reads the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn, while Evelyn is looking interestedly at a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn begins to say repeatedly: &#34;I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady&#34;. Suddenly Evelyn grabs a dagger lying nearby and stabs Kitty\&#39;s doll and then cuts her (the doll\&#39;s) head. A fight ensues. And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty. The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on, their grandfather tells them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them, in which a lady dressed in black is stabbing a lady dressed in red:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;A long time ago, a red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. They were sisters and hated each other. One night, for jealousy reasons, the black lady entered the red lady\&#39;s room and stabbed her seven times. One year later, the red lady left her grave. She killed six innocent people, and her seventh victim was the black lady. Once every hundred years, the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grandfather ends his tale by saying that according to the legend, sixteen years from now, the red queen should come again and kill seven times. But he assures them that this is just an old legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen years pass.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the very beginning of the film. There are many twists and surprises in the film. It\&#39;s better for you to forget about logic (if you really analyse it, the story doesn\&#39;t make sense) and just follow the film with its wonderful colors, the gorgeous women, the clothes, the tasteful decor, the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy Barbara Bouchet, Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti, Pia Giancaro, among other goddesses. There\&#39;s a nude by Sybil Danning lying on a sofa that\&#39;s something to dream about. And don\&#39;t forget: The lady in red kills seven times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;ve liked &#34;La Dama Rossa...&#34; check out also &#34;La Notte che Evelyn uscì dalla Tomba&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;Japan 1918. The story of 16-year old Ryu begins with the death of her father. As it will be revealed later, both of her parents have died of tuberculosis. In this desperate situation Ryus aunt has arranged a marriage with a Japanese man in Hawai, whom they know only from its picture. By her arrival in Hawai ryu discovers that her new husband is much older as in the photograph ,and that he lives in very humble circumstances beside a sugar cane plantage were he works on. Ryu not used to the hard labour on the plantage and in despair over her situation in her new home thinks of running away. She soon discovers that she has nowhere to go. The friendship to Kana, a female co-worker of hers, gives her new hope and strength. This picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s, when thousands of Asian woman were married off to men in America, whom they only knew from their picture. This not very well known picture is well written and acted. The location is breathtaking. This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his very last screen appearance as a Benshi (narrator of silent movies). This film gives some insight of Japanese culture here and across the ocean. A must see!&#39;,
   &#39;The Marriage of Maria Braun (MMB) is about a German girl (Maria) getting married to a German soldier (Herman Braun) just at the ending of the war. After being married for half a day and a night, Herman is send to the front again. To make ends meet, Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier. She got word that Herman died at the front, and things develop between her and the American soldier. Herman walks in on them, in bed, and after a confrontation between him and the American, Maria killed the American. Herman admits to the murder, ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him. The country is in shambles; one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette. There are food shortages. It is in short, a time of survival of the fittest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this film projects Maria\&#39;s attitudes - those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances, as a metaphor for Germany\&#39;s loss of soul after they lost the war, and how it proceeds to rebuild itself. For example, Maria has the following conversation with a peddler (played by Fassbinder himself); the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that &#34;Kleist burns out to quickly, it does not provide enough heat for the cold&#34;. The peddler answers &#34;That\&#39;s another way to look at it. Right now, it\&#39;s probably the correct way&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maria meets a French/German business man, Karl Oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment. She decides to get involve with Karl, &#34;You\&#39;re not having an affair with me; I\&#39;m having an affair with you&#34;. She also takes responsibility in the company, and after a while has the complete trust of the firm. When Karl says &#34;I suppose we\&#39;ll just have to wait for a miracle&#34; she replies &#34;I prefer making miracles \x96 then wait for them&#34;. In her own words, she has become the &#34;Mata Hari of the economic miracle&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a lot of Fassbinder\&#39;s films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms (see Freud); in other words, he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh*t, the false social mechanisms, the pretending. The direct approach Maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology. For example, she phones Karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point &#34;I need someone to sleep with&#34;. As Fassbinder said &#34;the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society&#34;. He also remarked that his films are anti emotional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly liked the scene when Karl and Maria meet in the Munich restaurant (apparently, frequently visited by Hitler himself). Maria appears in control and Karl a bit on the down side, as if Maria\&#39;s \&#39;brutal honesty\&#39; wears him out, as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore. Karl says &#34;I have to tell myself over and over that I love life&#34;. Maria replies &#34;That\&#39;s life isn\&#39;t it. As if we signed a contract to enjoy life. And then we go out to eat and talk about food&#34;. I guess this is also about Fassbinder attitudes on relationships, to never submit completely to anyone. And why would you, if the central matter of most of his films is about &#34;What love becomes in this society \x96 a commodity, an instrument of power, a weapon.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was remarked that it is typical Fassbinder to have the scenes with Maria and Betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war - with these clothing essentially the wrong period. What I think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes, when you feel bad, that &#34;you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great&#34;. But, Fassbinder was not interested in perfection. Any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project. Since he completed films (approximately 4 a year) the way other people rolled cigarettes, it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes. Peter Marthesheimer, who wrote most of the script, mentioned that Fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with Maria and the American in the park, overnight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanna Schygulla is brilliant as Maria. Mostly, she just stares bluntly into the camera. In Maria\&#39;s own words &#34;It is a bad time for emotions. But, I like it like that&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different opinions about the end. After Karl died of a hart attack, Herman finally shows up. (Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison, to &#34;become human again&#34;.) After the testament is delivered (made out to her and Herman in half), Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette, and blow her and Herman up. For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident. At the same time, she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true. She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore. She felt as if she had outlived herself.&#39;,
   &#39;This isn\&#39;t the best Bigfoot ever made, but by the recent standards of Nature gone awry movies, mostly showing on the Sci-Fi channel, this is quality stuff. It has some action, some humor, decent F/X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but so are some practical F/X, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of B horror/sci-fi and need a fix. It\&#39;s better than the movie Sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don\&#39;t be fooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate. Expect a bit of a lul as the characters are &#34;developed&#34;, but know that things will pick up. If you are watching a DVD you may want to skip a chapter or two.&#39;,
   &#34;Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in Italy in the 60s. The film has all of the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most any film worth seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story concerns a haunted castle. People have visited, but none have returned. Our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings. But, the night he visits is a special night. It&#39;s the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw I see in the movie is the running time. It almost feels padded. There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest. But once he does find something, the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castle of Blood is a definite must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.&#34;,
   &#39;Very few so called &#34;remakes&#34; can be as good as the originals. This one crosses that border with flying colors. Just a remake, I don\&#39;t think so! I saw it theatrically at the age of nine, and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. The earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie, but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film. This update is more epic and cinematic. Still, I thoroughly recommend both films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and the young, fun-loving American Bulldog, Chance. The animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche, Sally Field, and Michael J. Fox, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is virtually nothing offensive in the film. There is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No hard violence, save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall, an angry porcupine, and a dark railroad shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilarious, scary, moving, and above all real, it surprised me to see that this film didn\&#39;t win any awards, not one. Nevertheless, I will have to say this is just as good as some of the Best Picture nominees nowadays.&#39;,
   &#39;An American in Paris was, in many ways, the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical. Made at the height of MGM\&#39;s powers as a musical powerhouse, the film features memorable music from the Gershwins, who rightly have been called the 20th Century\&#39;s equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film, though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm-up for his best work in Singin\&#39; in the Rain (1952). The two films are actually closely linked. Aside from the Arthur Freed connection, the Broadway Melody segment in &#34;Rain&#34; owes its existence to the incredible American in Paris Ballet sequence in this film. This might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film. And it deserved to be, as it showcases Gene Kelly\&#39;s skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s cast is uniformly excellent. Leslie Caron, incredibly making her film debut, shows a maturity that makes you think she\&#39;d been making films for years. Her introductory dance sequence, and later her work on the Ballet, provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse\&#39;s work in Singin\&#39; in the Rain and The Band Wagon. Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly\&#39;s stoic pal, who gets two of the film\&#39;s best moments: during the end party sequence (which I will not give away for anyone who hasn\&#39;t seen the film), and one of the film\&#39;s most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state-of-the-art (for the time) special effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly\&#39;s romantic rival, though he does get a few musical highlights, and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron\&#39;s romantic rival. The May-December relationship between Kelly\&#39;s character and Nina\&#39;s reminded me of the same &#34;kept man&#34; relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin\&#39; in the Rain. The Ballet, though lavish and well-produced, doesn\&#39;t really fit with the rest of the movie. Without giving away the plot, the Ballet just happens, with no real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence, it really doesn\&#39;t have anything to do with the plot -- and in the best musicals, the songs always have some sort of raison d\&#39;etre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the Ballet. Although the ending shouldn\&#39;t be a surprise (this IS an MGM musical, after all), I was hoping for a bit more ... movie after the Ballet ended. It\&#39;s as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he couldn\&#39;t follow the Ballet with anything else. The film literally left me in the lurch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That negative aside, An American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best of Hollywood\&#39;s musicals. It doesn\&#39;t quite reach the heights of Singin\&#39; in the Rain, but it comes close and it remains a testament to Gene Kelly\&#39;s skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time.&#39;,
   &#34;Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised. It isn&#39;t completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerising as Tom Oakley. His transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised, making it more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw&#39;s finest hour. He was matched earnestly by a young Nick Robinson, who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother. The script and music made it worth the buy, and you also see Thaw playing the organ. Amazing! The most moving scene, was Willie finding out about Zak&#39;s death, and then Tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina. Buy this, you&#39;ll love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox&#34;,
   &#34;Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch&#39;s works is his most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, stricken brother, there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes (some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland, filmed by veteran cinematographer Freddy Francis) to make it an undeniable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter (whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances, one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time. But that&#39;s vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best. To those unfamiliar with Lynch or know him only by his violent, disturbing reputation, this is an excellent place to begin; for those who know his work, this is one of the finest in his repertoire.&#34;,
   &#34;We tend to forget that the master/slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well-tended estates, powered by large groups of enslaved people, and a lot of money for the white owners. It lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these children just became more slaves, and others were free...but free and coloured, which back then meant anything but, relative to the lot of their sires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A class formed around these offspring - the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour - and that class was able, to a certain extent, to own property, raise themselves from downtrodden to educated, and to attain a comparative dignity. That is to say, they weren&#39;t slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often, the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth, set up in their own houses, with allowances, schooling paid for for their children, and a kind of gentility, dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families. In essence, they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity, and relative independence from labour - an arrangement called plaçage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman, the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman, and the people who touched on their lives, in both a negative and a positive way. The tale was an eye-opener for me, a New Zealander, with no real conception of the black/white lines, let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel, by Anne Rice. The parts are well-cast, the costumes are wonderful, and the brutal way the lines are drawn out, with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through. The gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even the sympathetic ones, couldn&#39;t bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to everyone, unreservedly. If you can&#39;t handle the truth you&#39;ll cringe and cower through some parts, as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour, both by their white oppressors, and by their own people. Bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality, and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it may sound callous, but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me, despite the sour taste I found in my mouth at what went on, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Watch it. If not read up on the period, because there&#39;s a lesson to be learned from it all.&#34;,
   &#34;It&#39;s remarkable that for &#39;Young Mr. Lincoln&#39;s&#39; supporting players Ford cast lesser known, other-than-star actors. This not only heightens his film&#39;s focus on the central character of Lincoln, but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man embroiled, as each one of us inexorably is, in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them. It&#39;s not so much through Fonda&#39;s Lincoln&#39;s words and actions but in the faces, the reactions of the supporting players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln&#39;s worldview, sense of place in society and polity, and of how the people responded to Mr. Lincoln&#39;s words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, next time you view &#39;Young Mr. Lincoln&#39; shift your focus to the supporting characters - you will, I expect, be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford. I like to suspect that Ford&#39;s storytelling through the supporting characters&#39; reactions to Fonda&#39;s Lincoln may have appealed to David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in &#39;Doctor Zhivago&#39;, in which it&#39;s the supporting characters&#39; reactions to Zhivago that actually tell about Zhivago.&#34;,
   &#34;I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it doesn&#39;t, because this film is everything a Hollywood film isn&#39;t - original, creative, quirky and humorous. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn&#39;t conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#39;t written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world. The brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors, both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, nice sound design and (fairly) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s just a shame so few people know about Nothing....&#34;,
   &#34;Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it&#39;s not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what&#39;s going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn&#39;t overly impressive, however, the director makes good use of the props. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The character development is intentionally shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It&#39;s up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it&#39;s the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end.&#34;,
   &#39;I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that\&#39;s why i enjoyed the movie so much. Two days before the movie premiere I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the video &#34;zmeu&#34; before the movie and I thought I had it all figured.. i was wrong: instead of a good movie i assisted a great one! i FELT the movie. it was sad.. it was funny.. but most of all it pictured LOVE.. I can\&#39;t even begin to describe the soundtrack.. so i won\&#39;t :) I\&#39;m not a movie critic.. I can\&#39;t describe it in more words.. My kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless.. thank god for the keyboard :) Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)&#39;,
   &#39;Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family\&#39;s estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she\&#39;s Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You\&#39;ll probably guess why but won\&#39;t mind because this one is fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with &#34;The Narrow Margin&#34; and &#34;Face Behind the Mask&#34; this is one of the best B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It\&#39;s just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is well-directed, fast paced and exciting. It only stumbles at the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foch (a good actress) is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening) as the villains. Well worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget.&#39;,
   &#34;Domino is a great movie. It&#39;s about a young woman names Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty-hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins with two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke &amp; Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do, instead of the character of Domino.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with that, Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke follows up his Oscar-Worthy performance in &#39;Sin City&#39; with another tough-guy performance. Edgar Ramirez really doesn&#39;t do anything except speak Spanish every once in a while and stare at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good supporting performance. Mo&#39;Nique was herself, although she did surprise me on one particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about the movie though, is the direction. Tony Scott&#39;s fast-paced style really brings the movie to life. The cinematography is some of the best, I&#39;ve ever seen. It takes a regular movie and puts on acid. All the blacks are blacker, the whites are brighter, and it has a sort of green glow to it. The action scenes are exhilarating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: If you liked Sin City &amp; Man on Fire, you&#39;ll like Domino.&#34;,
   &#39;Aro Tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a Mission in Guatemala in the 70\&#39;s. Also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people (he used to kill pregnant women, and then he set them on fire).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of Aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Aro Tolbukhin&#34; is a serious work, so analytical, it\&#39;s not morbid at all. Such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My rate: 7/10&#39;,
   &#34;The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang. Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. No they don&#39;t because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains it to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a Waco like standoff. His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. It&#39;s not something he&#39;s proud of, she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he&#39;s on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coburn gets the bright idea of making sure Heston trails him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can&#39;t touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coburn&#39;s gang includes, Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox, and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along who is his son-in-law to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I&#39;m thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. Of which there is a lot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a little Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your film.&#34;,
   &#39;Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she\&#39;s attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was &#34;tricked&#34; into falling in love with Gillian? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular. It\&#39;s an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it. Just don\&#39;t go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread. The movie\&#39;s cute, funny at times, and touching in the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can\&#39;t quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even better and more memorable.&#39;,
   &#34;The Dentist is a really good thriller. And pretty disturbing. I think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters, vampires or zombies. That&#39;s exactly why this movie is so scary. During this film, you&#39;ll probably think about your own dentist a few times. Whether he&#39;s capable of doing such things...You better pray his wife doesn&#39;t cheat on him. That&#39;s what the story is all about. A respected dentist in LA snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool-boy. ( That must be the greatest profession in the world, by the way. Poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work) From then on our dentist, Dr. Feinstone, can only thing about taking revenge. He can&#39;t concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt. Things aren&#39;t made easier for our dentist when he&#39;s chased by an annoying tax-controller, a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his. At one point, Dr. Feinstone can&#39;t take it anymore. Now he&#39;s not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him.. The dentist is written and directed by Brian Yuzna and co-written by Stuart Gordon. You can take that as a recommendation to itself. These 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies ( and personal favorites of mine ) like Re-Animator, From Beyond and Society. With the Dentist, they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller. This film came right on time actually. The decade hadn&#39;t brought us many great horror films so far. I&#39;m not at all saying this IS a masterpiece, but it&#39;s a nice change. Corbin Bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene. I remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor, but he can sure handle a psychotic character. The rest of the cast does good work too. The woman who plays Feinstone&#39;s wife is really attractive. Also, it was great to see Ken Foree acting again. The actor from my all time favorite movie Dawn of the Dead plays the cop in this film. Yuzna casted him in From Beyond too, 15 years ago and I thank him for that. I don&#39;t recommend this movie to everyone (if you have a weak stomach, I&#39;ll advise you to skip it) but if you do watch it, you&#39;ll enjoy it very much. You&#39;ll be disgusted...but that&#39;s an extra reason, I think. It&#39;s been a while since I was really freaked out by watching a film. It&#39;s a great topic to handle in the genre and Yuzna does it in a great way. Too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel. My humble opinion on the Dentist ... 8/10&#34;,
   &#39;Guns blasting, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and that\&#39;s just the first ten minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This action-packed film involving a rogue ex-CIA mercenary who can\&#39;t seem to die no matter how many times he\&#39;s shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tough and toothy Gary Busey, usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks, has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued: after all he\&#39;s carrying the entire show. Which doesn\&#39;t mean there isn\&#39;t a lot of terrific supporting roles including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala, and several other &#34;forgotten&#34; character-actors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story: Busey has to free a group of &#34;kidnapped&#34; American military elites and return a high-tech &#34;supertank&#34; (a normal tank with a cheesy add-on pasted to the top) back to the States. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does America deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys? This question is asked, of course, like in any film centering on the CIA... but without getting preachy.&#39;,
   &#34;I think this show is definitely the greatest show. Jessica Alba does such a great job in it. Michael Weatherly also does an awesome job, as well as the rest of the cast. The show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing. It&#39;s like watching a 1-hour movie. It&#39;s definitely worth watching.&#34;,
   &#39;Now, I have seen a lot of movies in my day, but out of every single one there have been a very select few that have been really good to me. And I\&#39;m a 19 year old man which is impressed by this movie directed towards a younger audience. This is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign movies. Almost all the acting is believable, the graphics are decent (for which you won\&#39;t even be caring about as you watch the movie. Trust me, bitching about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do), the story is well written and it\&#39;s a movie that everyone can enjoy not just the kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here\&#39;s basically what this movie made me to. It one, made me laugh...a lot, two, made me feel for the characters like you\&#39;re suppose to, and three, it\&#39;s a very uplifting story. By the end of this movie you will feel good. Sure, what anime out there hasn\&#39;t featured some young kid turning into a great warrior and whatever to defeat some great evil. It\&#39;s a formula that is used a lot. But, in this case it is forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics you\&#39;d see 5 years ago, the appearance of it is not to be judged. It\&#39;s very touching, the ending is original, and it keeps you into the movie like it is suppose to. If you however try comparing this to other movies like &#34;The Never-ending Story&#34; or whatever it will diverse your opinion. Watch it as it is and you will enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a good long while since I\&#39;ve been impressed like this. The only other movie where I have gotten this feeling is when I saw TMNT way back when it came out. There is something about this movie I felt about TMNT that really made me love it. So don\&#39;t over-analyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.&#39;,
   &#39;Sidney Franklin\&#39;s &#34;The Good Earth&#34; has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting, especially from Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of O-Lan. Rainers performance is so complete, she is nearly unrecognizable. Having very little dialogue throughout the entire film (and it is a long one), Rainer relies instead on facial and body language. She looks and acts Chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it. When Lung and wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning. It is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch) that they again find fulfillment. A common formula told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film a classic. Money isn\&#39;t worth anything without friends and family, a point that the film drives home perfectly in it\&#39;s last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion.&#39;,
   &#39;Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can\&#39;t see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. Her more &#34;vocally correct&#34; version of &#34;Stay With Me&#34; never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.&#39;,
   &#34;This is, in my opinion, much better than either of the 2 1990&#39;s versions, but is still not all that good. It feels dated, probably because it is, but it does stand up well compared to other BBC 1980&#39;s period pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90&#39;s versions, and St John Rivers is at least covered, although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress playing Jane is much too old. There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie can be interpreted on many different levels. Don&#39;t listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w/e and that it is just about drugs. It has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the movie (and why I think it was personally made) is really not about that at all. It is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society. It shows, for a split second, that the main character&#39;s brother is watching those sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this gruesomeness that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people. As far as the scene about logic, it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn&#39;t as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level. You have to apply Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty) not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way. One of the best movies I have ever seen. It just might go way above your head; it isn&#39;t for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem. When you are critically analyzing a movie or writing your critical review&#39;s try not reading the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)&#34;,
   &#34;I used to love watching this. I had no idea it was part of a larger series. I must have been 6 or so at the time it was on TV. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination for something that was clear that was in the president&#39;s pile of bathtub toys. My parents had taped this off of TV when it originally aired on NBC. The tape even had the old Sanka coffee commercial along with a few others. I&#39;m planning on returning home sometime soon and will try to record the tape onto my computer so that those who want a copy can do so. If anyone of you would like to contact me, I think you can do that through the IMDb site feel free. I will keep you updated and let you know when I have the show in a digital format.&#34;,
   &#34;Great movie when I saw it. Have to say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. As I got older and saw it again I realized that the movie is average. Compared to movies that are known ad good comedys, this is nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great. Also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking. It&#39;s like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch. I like the movie overall so i give it a...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a good 7/10 for me.&#34;,
   &#39;I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as &#34;Steamy Romance&#34; I was a little bit skeptical. &#34;Steamy&#34;? In a movie from 1968?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot entirely in black &amp; white, I knew my erotic hopes were dashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong! Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love, fear of the secret being found out, a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black &amp; white. The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years. And the performances from the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they\&#39;re both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls. It\&#39;s 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the \&#39;60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then. Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination, opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action: Although it won\&#39;t be all you expect, I don\&#39;t think you\&#39;ll be too, too disappointed.&#39;,
   &#39;This is a great short. i think every voice is done by jason steele. (you can only just barely tell if you\&#39;ve heard his normal voice though, so don\&#39;t worry about them sounding the same. they don\&#39;t.) its about 15 minutes long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edward the spatula is fighting the war against spoons and he meets some weird people. in fact, everyone he knows seem pretty crazy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;edward!&#34; &#34;general peterson, we have to get you to a medical unit!&#34; &#34;no, I\&#39;m not gonna make it edward.&#34; &#34;dont talk like that, I\&#39;m sure you\&#39;ll be fine.&#34; &#34;im a goner edward, and you know it. before i go-&#34; &#34;yes?&#34; &#34;can i just have... one kiss?&#34; &#34;umm, no.&#34; &#34;come on, just one, small, peck on the lips?&#34; &#34;im walking away now sir.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there\&#39;s gonna be movie pretty soon. the date for that is in September, but its probably gonna get pushed back.&#39;,
   &#39;this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see. i was talked into it and dragged into the theater, but boy am i glad for that. i thought it was going to be just another love story, but it turns out to be SOOO much more than that. definatly an intellectual flick, one of those movies you have to pay attention to.&#39;,
   &#34;A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking off the competition. But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling (and not so) LA actor. It brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit. It&#39;s also got a polished look and very adept direction under Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn&#39;t compromise its production values at any level. The writing is tight, the dialogue first rate. Cassini is an actor&#39;s actor, and the role really shows off his talents. The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic, and may go down as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it at an advanced screening, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards.&#34;,
   &#34;A great addition to anyone&#39;s collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 monkeys is a movie you don&#39;t see every day. It has excellent actors to go with a excellent story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis but he holds the role like he holds John McClane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man(Bruce)is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors in this were awesome. I must give a mention to Brad Pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient James Cole(Bruce) meets in a mental hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#34;,
   &#34;They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I&#39;m sure wasn&#39;t released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? And which format that would be?&#34;,
   &#34;Govind Nihalani&#39;s directorial venture of Vijay Tendulkar&#39;s novel is brilliant. Om Puri plays an inspector Velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty, played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar. This is Govind Nihlan&#39;s Most talked about movie. This is a very good and a classic film. Smita Patil plays the female lead opposite Om Puri. Naseeruddin Shah is brilliant in a cameo role. Although Sadashiv Amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the movie he dominates the movie. This was Sadashiv Amrapurkars acting debut.Om Puri won a national award for this film for the best actor. Filmfare award winner for Best Film,Story,Supporting Actor(Sadashiv Amrapurkar).&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is very great! The acting is fine, with excellent casting of Corbin Bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients. In the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman, and then he goes crazy. He also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman, beside the patients he tortures. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some are really fake (like a drilled-out tongue, that has laid for 1 night outside, and is still red in the morning). But the torture scenes are absolutely well-done. Though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow; between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts. But for the real horror/thriller-fan this is a must-watch!&#39;,
   &#39;I liked the movie a real lot. Wanted to see it just for Dara Tomanovich, but the plot and story were ok too. A very cool change in plot when you least expect it.&#39;,
   &#34;10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must see, with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years, untill this was screened in 1974. The film clips in this documentary from the war doesn&#39;t miss out anything, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. The whole series is over 20 episodes long, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war. Simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still, and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch. You must watch this at some time, even if it&#39;s a few episodes, even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of WAR, in a WORLD AT WAR..&#34;,
   &#34;In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, the two other films by Jafar Panahi that I&#39;ve seen, the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem, on the surface, slight. In Offside, Panahi&#39;s seriocomic tribute to Iranian women standing up for their rights, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s as successful. Not that what he&#39;s saying isn&#39;t important, of course (and it&#39;s too bad that, like pretty much every other Panahi film, Iranians can&#39;t see it). But, after a while, the film feels a tad flat, and it feels long even at 90 minutes. Not saying I didn&#39;t like it, though. The actors are all fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious. But it&#39;s not an important work, in my opinion.&#34;,
   &#39;For the record, I am not affiliated with the production in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date. Over 7 seasons (this is the last) they have produced some 50 or so episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By their own admission, the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects, green screen work and acting all improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find it difficult to &#34;dip into&#34; so started from the beginning and watched all the way through. HF benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the Star Trek universe in which it is set. Characters and &#34;relatives&#34; from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories, sometimes improving on the characters over the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper reels, a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for high definition, high budget productions, this is probably not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for continued adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that does Star Trek credit and makes you think, this is the one.&#39;,
   &#34;Page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye-opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocrite lifestyles of Mumbai&#39;s elite. From the fake kisses to the plastered smiles, Page 3 leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption, and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glam. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where Social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality. Everyone is constantly craving for more money, more fame, and a higher reputation, driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing film contracts at a funeral to child molestation. Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist. She observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind-boggling frenzy that the socialites live in. Bollywood, business tycoons, politicians, and the underworld are all intertwined in a completely convoluted mess! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice track as is the peppy Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Terrific film with excellent character development!&#34;,
   &#39;There I was sitting alone in my flat on a Saturday night with the choice of watching CITIZEN X or The Eurovision Song Contest , and for the benefit of Americans reading this I\&#39;ll explain that TESC is an annual event where musicians from countries all over Europe and Asia Minor have a song contest. At the end of the contest countries vote to see what the best song was . It\&#39;s a contest that is even less exciting than it sounds and it may not come as a shock when I say that singing and songwriting isn\&#39;t of the calibre of Lennon and McCartney . And I should correct something in the first sentence of this review because the word &#34; Choice &#34; is misleading because being a music lover I wasn\&#39;t going to watch TESC under any circumstance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sat down as the credits rolled for CITIZEN X expecting a run of mill serial killer whodunnit , but I\&#39;d be misleading everyone calling it that. It\&#39;s obvious within the first 10 minutes of CITIZEN X whodunnit . What the film does is point out the failures of communism : &#34; A serial killer comrade ! This is the Soviet Union , serial killers can only exist in decadent imperialist capitalist systems &#34; This farcical attitude goes far beyond denial , there\&#39;s a scene where an undercover cop sits in a freezing train station keeping an eye out for potential suspects whilst wearing his police jacket because it\&#39;s the only warm coat he\&#39;s got ! And of course all suspects who are members of the communist party are released without interrogation something which will affect the final death toll . All this is very well done as we are shown that it\&#39;s the communist party system that\&#39;s on trial but about two thirds of the way through CITIZEN X we find ourselves in 1990 as communism is on its last legs and reforms to the police investigation have taken place . It\&#39;s at this point that the film becomes rather uninteresting due to a lack of political subtext and the film descends into an average manhunt film . But don\&#39;t let that put you off , CITIZEN X is an intelligent thriller well played by the cast especially Donald Sutherland as a paternal police chief&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely enough a few years ago I read something written by the famous criminologist Colin Wilson in which he said something along the lines that serial killers let themselves get caught so that they will be the center of attention in the media spotlight , and I found myself almost sympathising the party chiefs denying there could be a serial killer in the Soviet Union. After all media is controlled by the party and anyone who\&#39;s old enough to have listened to Radio Moscow or read English translations of Pravda will know that the USSR only reported news stories like potato harvests , coal production and thank you letters from Afghanistan , Cuba etc for Soviet assistance . The concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical . But I guess if a tree falls in a remote Siberian forest it will still make a sound even though no one is around to hear it .&#39;,
   &#34;I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay. Usually, I am into war and action movies but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are bored by today&#39;s special FX films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening. What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself. Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of Stewart. (OK, weired example.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. Yet still, I liked it a lot. If you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.&#34;,
   &#39;The most satisfying element about &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan\&#39;s love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful aspect about &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the &#34;frat pack&#34; formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It\&#39;s difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, &#34;Dan in Real Life&#34; is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.&#39;,
   &#39;[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this adult friend for whom the notion that her parents have sex makes her terribly uneasy. She came to mind when I reflected on the audience\&#39;s reaction to &#34;The Mother.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People gasped when May (Anne Reid) writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by May. I doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings\&#39; content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi (&#34;My Beautiful Laundrette,&#34; &#34;My Son the Fanatic&#34;) again proves why he\&#39;s among the most trenchant storytellers on either side of the Atlantic. His story\&#39;s not easy to take. This searing family drama isn\&#39;t a film you can claim you enjoyed watching because it\&#39;s raw, complex, and often makes us very uncomfortable. Nevertheless, it\&#39;s powerfully good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed &#34;Notting Hill,&#34; of all things) craft an unsentimental, wrenching and superbly-acted portrait of an older woman who realizes, after all these years, she can and should still enjoy all of life\&#39;s pleasures. In a wonderfully epiphanous moment, when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be difficult, May shoots back, &#34;Why not?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her turn as May. It\&#39;s subtle, restrained, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. Watch Reid when May observes Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a seemingly passionate clutch in a pub. Or, when she begs Paula to open the front door after a disastrous date. Reid\&#39;s eyes and face reveal all of May\&#39;s anguish and despair. In the film\&#39;s most devastating moment, May drops to her knees before Darren, willing to do anything for him, only asking him to be kind. This is a tremendously gutsy performance by a remarkable actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed Michell\&#39;s use of natural sound, especially when May and Toots first arrive at Bobby\&#39;s place. It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots, the flippant manner in which their own family welcomes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film, at times, reminded me of the honesty and rawness of Mike Leigh\&#39;s work, except &#34;The Mother&#34; hangs on to a slight sense of optimism to keep afloat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one quibble: Michell\&#39;s decision to give May and Darren\&#39;s first love scene an almost cheesy sensibility. The lovers remain out of focus while, in the foreground, a white curtain flutters gently in the breeze. And the only sound is of May in the throes of passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with Michell\&#39;s approach is that both Reid and Craig, who completely envelops the role of Darren, plough their way so fearlessly into these roles that it\&#39;s unfair to hide their characters\&#39; almost primitive energy from the audience. Especially since Michell has no qualms about making later sex scenes visceral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film doesn\&#39;t have immensely likable characters. We sympathize with May, but she, too, causes her daughter\&#39;s suffering. But I doubt Kureishi intended to people his story with likable folk. His point, I believe, was to unmask a family that\&#39;s already cracking when something emotionally cataclysmic happens. It\&#39;s unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable.&#39;,
   &#34;I read somewhere (in a fairly panning review) that this is something of a live-action mecha anime, and I think they&#39;re on the right lines. I first watched this movie when I was very young and I&#39;ve been dying to see it again, and when I finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back. I don&#39;t think this is to be taken too seriously - it&#39;s just a bit of good old 80&#39;s almost-a-TV-movie fun (it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future, although this point isn&#39;t stressed too much). What I admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn&#39;t sound generic - no clichés, no predictable lines - all in all just good fun! Maybe time hasn&#39;t been kind to this little movie, but still I can find appreciation for it in me. It&#39;s by no means perfect, but it&#39;s entertaining and doesn&#39;t try to be anything other than that. Let the nerds and comic-store-guys worry about technicalities - who cares? See it for yourself and make your own decision. No-one else&#39;s opinion matters.&#34;,
   &#39;No, this hilariously horrible 70\&#39;s made-for-TV horror clinker isn\&#39;t about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake. Still, this exceptionally awful, yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, unremitting silliness and atrociousness that\&#39;s quite tasty in a so-execrable-it\&#39;s-downright-awesome sort of way. Richard Crenna, looking haggard and possibly inebriated, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in &#34;Jackson County Jail,&#34; sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute German Shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit. Pretty soon Mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the Disney &#34;Witch Mountain&#34; pictures) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty, ugly canine entity in the den. Boy, now doesn\&#39;t that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain\&#39;t, but it sure is funny, thanks to Curtis (&#34;Night Tide&#34;) Harrington\&#39;s hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully risible\&#39;n\&#39;ridiculous plot, and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story (besides the leads, both Martine Beswicke and R.G. Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on Crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade. While stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock, devout TV trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to Alpo.&#39;,
   &#34;&#39;I only wanted to see you laughing in the Purple Rain.&#39; This is an excell film. It should have been re-rated to PG-13. But anyways, Prince&#39;s first film and greatest. The follow-up sucked. But I haven&#39;t seen for years so here&#39;s what I can remember about it. The Kid (Prince) has to juggle with winning over the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), keeping his band together (The Revolution as themselves) and the tension in his family. But his rival band (The Time as themselves) is ruining his life. Like Morris (himself) is trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry and if you luv it, buy it.&#34;,
   &#39;Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still got game! A few years ago he shot &#34;Find me guilty&#34;, a proof to everyone that Vin Diesel can actually act, if he gets the opportunity and the right director. If he had retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could have blamed him. But he\&#39;s still going strong, his next movie already announced for 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let\&#39;s stay with this movie right here. The cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. The little nuances in their performances, the &#34;real&#34; dialogue and/or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing. The (time) structure of the movie, that keeps your toes the whole time, blending time-lines so seamlessly, that the editing seems natural/flawless. The story is heightened by that, although even in a &#34;normal&#34; time structure, it would\&#39;ve been at least a good movie (Drama/Thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! :o)&#39;,
   &#39;Bored and unhappy young babe Zandalee (a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout Erika Anderson) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent, yet dull businessman Thierry Martin (a solid and credible portrayal by Judge Reinhold). Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third. The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: &#34;I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive&#34;). Better still, this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight). The tart\&#39;n\&#39;tangy New Orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings. With his long, scruffy black hair, greasy mustache, foul mouth, and coarse manners, Cage\&#39;s Johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing &#34;romantic&#34; lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid. The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: Anderson, Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee\&#39;s merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri, Viveca Lindfors as Theirry\&#39;s wise, perceptive mother Tatta, Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack, and Steve Buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief. Walt Lloyd\&#39;s sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look. The flavorsome, harmonic score by Pray for Rain likewise hits the spot. A delightfully campy and seamy riot.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Enter the Fat Dragon&#34; is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of &#34;Way of the Dragon.&#34; Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. Luckily, Sammo\&#39;s character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There\&#39;s a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like &#34;The Game of Death&#34;, where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the films I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I\&#39;ve seen. Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 8.5/10!&#39;,
   &#34;This movie was featured on a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this film, I don&#39;t think about that wonderful TV series. I believe this was a surprisingly good early 40&#39;s horror flick, with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. I actually enjoyed watching Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides, an old hag, and her two bizarre sons, one a giant idiot, the other a comical dwarf(Angelo Rossitto from 1932&#39;s Freaks). I also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent film is it&#39;s plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. I don&#39;t want to spoil any of this film, so go out and rent it, or, better yet, buy it for a couple of bucks.&#34;,
   &#39;I actually found this movie \&#39;interesting\&#39;; finally one worth my time to watch and rent. It is true... some scenes were over the top on emotionalism, shouting, etc., but what movie doesn\&#39;t stress its agenda, genre or \&#39;ax to grind\&#39;? Almost None! What surprised me is that I read a review elsewhere done by a S.Fran reviewer on another review site, but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his &#34;own&#34; review of the movie; not of the movie at all. Anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends; no car chases, Yea!! Being &#34;in&#34; an Italian family myself, I can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen. The movie has its tear jerking parts as well. It is what real life can be in such an environment. Nice movie.&#39;,
   &#39;I had lost faith in Sooraj R. Barjatya after the movie Main Prem Ki Deewani hoon, then a year back now I saw promos for Vivah which looked good. But I didn\&#39;t want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema. When the film first came out on DVD I rented it and watched and I loved the movie and took back my words for Sooraj. I just finished watching it yesterday again and this time I thought I have to review this movie. Sooraj R. BarjatyaGot it right this time, okay I was not a huge fan of Hum App Ke Hai Kaun. But I have always loved Manie Pyar kiya, after Manie Pyar kiya to me I think Vivah is Barjatyas best work. I hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying. If you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it, my view a much underrated movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of this movie you might call desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it\&#39;s an old tradition. It\&#39;s done in present times, lots of people don\&#39;t believe in this arrange marriage, but I do. The journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly. When Prem meets Poonam for the first time, they show it how it is and that\&#39;s reality and my parents where saying that\&#39;s how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way Prem and Poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen. It was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song &#34;Do Ajnabe&#34; shows that very well. Getting back to the story yes it\&#39;s a journey which you soon get glued to between Prem and Poonam (Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao) and there families. A twist occurs in this movie which is really good, the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between Prem and Poonam, how they fall for each other is too sweet. Simple boy and Simple Girl, when they first meet during and after the song &#34;Do Anjane Ajnabe&#34; It\&#39;s very sweet to watch, She hardly says anything and Prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking. Then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that\&#39;s when they really do fall for each other. It makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have. Another factor is that Poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for Poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with Poonam more then just Prem. When she finds happiness through Prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl. Which brings me to performances and Amrita Roa as Poonam is amazing in the movie, her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness. Shahid Kapoor as Prem is amazing too, he is Poonam support in the film, he is her happiness the movie, together they share an amazing chemistry and I have never seen a cuter couple since SRK and Kajol. If Ishq Vishk didn\&#39;t touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will. &#34;Mujhe Haq hai&#34; the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show. Scenes which touched me was when Prem takes Poonam to his room and shows her that\&#39;s where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet. Again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to. The film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction is spot on, to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them. To me this film pulled me in and for those three hours I felt really connected to the movie. The songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after I saw the movie I been playing the songs non stop! The music is amazing, the story is simply amazing too what more can I ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can finally say it, rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good, this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person. Its basically the sweetest journey ever, its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it\&#39;s the bestest part of your life\x85Well this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that? Why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing! Watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing!&#39;,
   &#34;SPOILERS 9/11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC.2 French film makers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD are being confronted with this event and make the most of it.Before 9/11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario. On the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change.As one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane,this is the only footage of the first impact.He rides with the firemen to the WTC and goes inside the building.As the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident.In the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible,in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds,these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground,this is the most grueling moment in the documentary.Then the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his life,you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building.Then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black,he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of Downtown New York. Because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody&#39;s memory.I saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon of,so this makes it even more realistic to watch. 10/10&#34;,
   &#34;Luckily, not knowing anything about this movie I was curious enough to tape it from TV. And then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#39;m glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. Considering the production year 1969, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course now it doesn&#39;t surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. And it&#39;s not just because of the two George&#39;s actresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, And it certainly did hit me. Very effective. Also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. Well, being a case of war, mostly bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the fans of composer Ennio Morricone this is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching but never over the top. And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fräulein! Let&#39;s hope they get this on DVD soon, so I can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem.&#34;,
   &#39;This is one of those westerns that, well, stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog. Very few can hold up to it over the long haul. That said, the rest is pretty bad. Nevertheless I am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and perhaps a few more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is riddled with weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore the most glaring. However it does have one truly memorable scene. Nothing like it. Its right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff, and goes to Jack Elams place trying to goad him into a fight. Wonderful stuff. Right up with the best in any western.&#39;,
   &#39;I´m glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be - lovely, amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends. The plot might be not very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet. The cast is perfectly selected although Scott Wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit. So, the sparks are on all the right places, supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel. It is just the right sort of entertainment for a Sunday evening.&#39;,
   &#34;This is the story of Australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid. Since they are out of uniform, they are, justly, treated as spies. As such, they are tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. The Japanese court-martial, out of admiration for their heroism, authorizes that they be given a warrior&#39;s death. Of course, under the code of Bushido, this means that they are to be beheaded. A fate for which, as westerners, they are unprepared.&#34;,
   &#39;Since Educating Rita, Julie Walters has been one of my role models, and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves get in synch with his feminine side is magnificent. I would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress, but Walters pulls it off with gusto and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to-date in the male lead.&#39;,
   &#34;Guys and Dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever. It is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals-musicals were made to entertain, not to to preach. Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can&#39;t sing! It was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when I couldn&#39;t understand him. If it weren&#39;t for Marlon I would have given this 10 stars. Guys and Dolls provides old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. Watch it to have a good time!!&#34;,
   &#39;Fay Grim is, on its face, a tale of espionage and intrigue told with a nod and a wink. As the sequel to his extraordinary Henry Fool, Hal Hartley creates a surprising blend of film noir and hardboiled spy thriller that starts with a knowing smile and large dose of laughter and turns as poignant and warm as any film I\&#39;ve seen this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parkey Posey is Fay Grim, an unwitting Mata Hari caught between the love of her exiled husband Henry Fool and the questionable intentions of a charming CIA operative. As Agent Fulbright, Jeff Goldblum is a master of wit and sarcasm, in a role that seems tailored to his talents. He has never been better. James Urbaniak is Fay\&#39;s brother Simon, jailed but renowned for his wildly popular books of poetry. His love of his work and his sister brings a jolt of passion to contrast the dour nature of the spies which eventually populate Fay\&#39;s world. And Liam Aiken is Fay\&#39;s oversexed 14 year-old son. Although that may be redundant. Aiken\&#39;s understated style is remarkably &#34;old soul&#34; for someone his age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire film is shot Dutch angle, the off-kilter style made famous by Orson Welles and used primarily in horror films and psychological thrillers to impart a sense of foreboding. In Fay Grim, using that style from opening credits to closing is intriguing at first, deceptively clever the next. For just as the viewer begins to fall for the perfectly timed comedic elements and wit of Hartley\&#39;s brilliant script, something happens. The film takes a dark yet strangely comforting turn as these characters magically become sympathetic before our eyes. What began as dark comedy morphs into romantic drama, and the transition is masterful. Slow pacing gives way to breathtaking action, and we are sucked right into the vortex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, Hartley\&#39;s sharp dialog combined with the amazing performances of a perfectly matched ensemble cast makes for a delicious cinematic cocktail. Told with the luxury of one able to write, produce, direct, edit, and even compose the music, Hal Hartley has crafted a smart, sexy tale of espionage with tongue just barely planted in cheek. Fay Grim is one part Dashiell Hammett, one part Raymond Chandler, and one part Ian Fleming, shaken and maybe stirred as well.&#39;,
   &#39;To fight against the death penalty is a just cause. Everyone who is sane in Europe would think so. In the USA everything is different. The film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving American justice. A young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case. But the film has a sequel. Justice in the USA is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance. Miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance. One person in the local Public Attorney Offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges. This Public Attorney\&#39;s officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free. But he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire. He hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance. But he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls. He apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys. One day the local cops follow their intuition, guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl, and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of. They beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and Russian roulette. He confesses. Sent to death row, he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in Massachusetts who is the husband of the Local Public Attorney\&#39;s representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails. It will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice, police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality, some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance. To charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice. The best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention, just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence, which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial, hence easily discardable, with a good lawyer. The film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we don\&#39;t want to make a mistake, which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief Americans are supposed to have: &#34;We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.&#34; (Declaration of Independence) Life is an unalienable Right that was given to man by his Creator, which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away. Only God can take the life of a person away. The death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have. Even if we do not evoke God, we cannot justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance, and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace. If vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty. And there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of Happiness but of vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;A Guy Thing&#34; may not be a classic, but it sure is a good, funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and Becky (Julia Stiles) lying naked in his bed. Before he can figure out what happened, he rushes Becky out of his apartment because his fiance Karen (Selma Blair) is coming. After that, as you could imagine, chaos ensues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every single scene in &#34;A Guy Thing&#34; delivers loud laughs. The funniest moments come from when Paul imagines what could happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a truly talented comedian, and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused. Although, she turns out to be more funny than Stiles\&#39; character, who actually isn\&#39;t that interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, &#34;A Guy Thing&#34; is no classic, but it\&#39;s not bad either, 7/10.&#39;,
   &#34;So when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it. we would watch it all the time. when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we&#39;d watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa&#39;s magical toys. I&#39;m 21 now and i still love this movie, some old friends and i recently got together and watched it, we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little. One friend actually bought this movie and grandpa&#39;s magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie. This really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe, no violence, no bad language, just lots of great songs and important lessons.&#34;,
   &#39;Yes, a tap dancing horror thriller........with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. This is demented and campy fun and part of the guignol cycle of the 60s that leaked into the 70s. Released as a double feature with the Burt Reynolds comedy FUZZ this mad scare is so bonkers as to be throughly entertaining. Like a mix of DAY OF THE LOCUST, THE OTHER and BABY JANE, I suggest any prospective viewer take on the idea that this is almost meant to be skew-iff and sit with someone with whom you can shriek and elbow all through it. Actually, get drunk whilst you watch it.....on cheap champagne. Again, with many 30s film ideas they are also about delusion; the struggle of the time for a better life getting bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder. But this one is just plain crazy. It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA the De Niro - Winters shlock fest that makes this film look positively glorious.&#39;,
   &#34;I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance Collora could make a fine film. This trailer didn&#39;t quite give me the same impression. The story line, or potential story line, was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good TV movie or television show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Michael O&#39;Hearn is not that good a Superman. I actually thought he, in his brief appearance, made a decent Clark Kent. Sorry, I just don&#39;t think of SuperMan as being that buff. The suit Kent wore masked his size. Batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not Superman. Supes is toned no doubt but not bulk. Anyway, I didn&#39;t care for all his posing and his transformation from Kent to Superman seemed cheezy. Now this may not be just O&#39;Hearn&#39;s fault, Collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the special effects for flying were cheezy. Superman flies through the sky. If was obvious that this Superman flew close to the ground, with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him. I don&#39;t think there were any full body shots of Superman flying. Evidently the harness and rigging supporting O&#39;Hearn must have been located on his lower torso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it was a good trailer. I&#39;d probably pay to see a film, if ever made, and would be sure to catch it on television. The story line, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman jealous of Lois&#39;s attraction to Wayne, Lex and Twoface teaming to beat Superman and the joining of forces between Batman &amp; Superman is a good one. I&#39;m sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film Collora and company, even O&#39;Hearn could deliver a decent film. Certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of Hollywood lately.&#34;,
   &#34;Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don&#39;t see, what we expect and what surprises us. THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn&#39;t set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! Her daughters, along with Ben&#39;s wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living. The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story&#39;s warm ending. All is not what it seemed: it&#39;s better and, well, different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film. Well worth viewing. Grady Harp&#34;,
   &#34;I loved this movie. In fact I loved being an actress in this movie. Iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. You may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film. I was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector. In fact they double took me a few times so it&#39;s hard to miss that mistake. Thumbs up to Full Moon High. Wish it come to cable soon.

   &#39;Having looked at some of the other comments here, I have a main complaint with this presentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful &#34;victim,&#34; and the handsome, obviously extremely &#34;off-center,&#34; blue-collar protagonist (if just short of &#34;totally-deranged&#34;) - take turns beating the hell out of each other, sort of like a Caucasian Kabuki scenario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all right, and this is, of course, mainly a &#34;turning-the-tables&#34; story. However, my referenced complaint is that I believe the director got caught-up in his desire to display Farrah\&#39;s well-known and obvious physical attributes. Beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe, and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes, these distract from the poignancy level of the drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her roommates I\&#39;m certain give performances as written and directed - however, their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing, don\&#39;t ring true -- based upon Farrah\&#39;s previous experience with this guy, the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions, and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a film and story, compelling as much in spite of, as because of, the director\&#39;s work.&#39;,
   &#34;Add Paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal characters. This movie is a love story - bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and beloved Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after Marie&#39;s parents sell him to a pawn shop. Before the heart warming ending we learn all the misadventures of Paulie. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are marvelous. Beautiful photography throughout. Great little movie, word of mouth will make it a cult favorite.&#34;,
   &#39;Having seen both &#34;Fear of a Black Hat&#34; and &#34;This is Spinal Tap&#34;, I can honestly state that while similar, both movies are truly must see. There will be many times in &#34;Fear&#34; that will have you in hysterics. It is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following. &#34;Fear&#34; will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you must, but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.&#39;,
   &#39;The first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen. It was a bad version of \&#39;Back to the Future\&#39; with zero charm. Once accepted that Bill &amp; Ted are nitwits, the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By today\&#39;s standards, this is more fun. This was shunned upon release, sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time. We get the photographer of \&#39;Face/Off\&#39;, the editor of \&#39;Fugitive\&#39;, a production designer from Burton\&#39;s early work, and the sound designer of \&#39;Matrix\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep. Since this was shunned by the fanbase and public, the director probably decided the style was too extreme. It\&#39;s not, it fits the material. Like \&#39;Death Becomes Her\&#39; and \&#39;Catch-22\&#39;, this dares to be smart, but we like our movies &#34;simple&#34; so we don\&#39;t buy it. Probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off. What\&#39;s so good?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Nice self-reference towards Keanu; from airhead to Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts, he makes his own hatred. The Evil B&amp;T and the &#34;good robot usses&#34; have the same vocabulary as their originals: lesser copies and depreciation of language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The &#34;duality&#34; motif. Nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles, lots of high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith from \&#39;Total Recall\&#39; to emphasize the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The &#34;choices&#34; motif. I don\&#39;t know where this started in the genre (maybe \&#39;Ghostbusters\&#39;), but it\&#39;s used pretty well here. It even boils down to the 7 games against death--Battleship and Club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Film self-reference, even present in the game against Death (Clue). This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Notice the Premier magazine cover at the end: &#34;Bill and Ted: The Movie.&#34; Ironic also how Death and Nomolos were villains in the \&#39;Die Hard\&#39; and \&#39;Lethal Weapon\&#39; sequels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some minor nits, but nothing compared to the original. Music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former--particularly in the teen market. Carlin is a great comedian, but in these movies he\&#39;s wasted. Also, for all the daring this effort shows, even cracking gay jokes, they can\&#39;t kill a cat?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, despite looking like a Nickelodeon production, this is incredibly interesting. From this movie we got Beavis and Butt-Head. &#34;We\&#39;re in Heaven and we just mugged three people.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Analysis = = Midrange Material&#39;,
   &#34;This film is a great example of fine storytelling. The acting is superb. The story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake. There were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were, but considering it is a Hollywood movie, they showed amazing restraint. There wasn&#39;t a single explosion shown in the movie, even though they had one opportunity to. The film, while having suspenseful parts, was not made into an action movie. The story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times. Well done!&#34;,
   &#39;I have always been a huge fan of &#34;Homicide: Life On The Street&#34; so when I heard there was a reunion movie coming up, I couldn\&#39;t wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I\&#39;ve ever seen. It was great to see everyone back again, but the biggest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-together great show.&#39;,
   &#34;I thought this movie did a down right good job. It wasn&#39;t as creative or original as the first, but who was expecting it to be. It was a whole lotta fun. the more i think about it the more i like it, and when it comes out on DVD I&#39;m going to pay the money for it very proudly, every last cent. Sharon Stone is great, she always is, even if her movie is horrible(Catwoman), but this movie isn&#39;t, this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime, and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs. Don&#39;t wait for it to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. Don&#39;t expect a masterpiece, or something thats gripping and soul touching, just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven&#39;t seen it see it, because what the critics and box office say doesn&#39;t always count, see it for yourself, you never know, you might just enjoy it. I tip my hat to this movie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#34;,
   &#34;Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the Academy Award winning &#39;Gandhi&#39;, back in &#39;83. I didn&#39;t know of any other work of his till i recently came across &#39;Cry Freedom&#39;, released back in 1987. While it may not have been as popular as his Gandhi, it is every bit as gripping, if not more, and was released when South Africa still had not got rid of the shackles of apartheid. While most movies on social issues come out after the event had happened, i guess this one released during the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is based on real life characters and events. The book on which the movie was based, was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who used to work in South Africa until the end of the seventies. It traces the origins of Woods friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who is wonderfully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I cannot imagine a better choice for the role. Washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence, which Biko&#39;s character required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While initially, Woods was against what he felt was black racism being spread by Biko, after meeting the man, he could not help being drawn into his struggles and ideas. The bond between them grows stronger, and Woods and his family realise and become more sensitive to the plight of the people Biko represents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, finally, tragedy strikes, and Woods must now concentrate on escaping from South Africa, with his book, so that he can get it published and let the outside world know what is going on. The second half of the movie is a gripping tale of his escape from South Africa, along with his family, and will keep you on tenterhooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some deliciously humorous dialogues too. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lawyer: Do you advocate violence? Biko: I advocate a confrontation. Lawyer: Well, isn&#39;t that violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: Not necessarily. You and I are having a confrontation now, but i don&#39;t see any violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that pervaded the country before better sense prevailed. The scene where the army opens fire on a protest by school children is gut wrenching and heartbreaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a must watch. I would suggest those not familiar with Attenborough&#39;s work, do take time out for this. There are movies which make a lot of money. And there are movies which make lives. I would any day prefer the latter.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie is amazing. The plot was just...wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised by Gackt&#39;s and Hyde&#39;s performance, after growing up in the American world of the actors who can&#39;t sing and singers who can&#39;t act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this movie, a young Sho (Gackt) comes across a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, they form an unlikely friendship. Kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others, the half-life of a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a sad movie, but not sappy. The plot was very unique, and contrary to your typical vampire flick. The storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only fault I would say the movie had, despite it&#39;s lack of a happy--albeit peaceful\x97ending, would be it&#39;s multiple languages. I had the unsubdued version (I&#39;m lucky that I understood it all save some of the Cantonese), so I would recommend getting something with subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the movie was just awesome.&#34;,
   &#39;This is such a great movie &#34;Call Me Anna&#34; because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I don\&#39;t like is I can\&#39;t get it on tape, I\&#39;ve tried looking for it but with no success. Any one know how to get it?&#39;,
   &#39;Loosely intended as a satire of D.W. Griffith\&#39;s Intolerance, The Three Ages was Buster Keaton\&#39;s first attempt at a full length comedy feature. The only similarities to Intolerance are the opening &#34;book&#34; scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film. Keaton\&#39;s reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it didn\&#39;t succeed as a feature film, it could be reduced to three two-reelers. Fortunately, The Three Ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I\&#39;ve seen in any of Keaton\&#39;s film. There is nothing unique or daring about the story lines. They are simple boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl plots, but the period satires are riotous and set the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all films of this genre. However, I don\&#39;t believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy. No one can play the lovable goof like Keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best. In addition, Wallace Beery\&#39;s appearance as Keaton\&#39;s rival adds to this film\&#39;s appeal. Anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920\&#39;s cannot be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie.&#39;,
   &#34;To say this film is simply a demonisation of Catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue. That is not what this film is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this film is is a comment on the abuses of the Church (although this could be substituted for any powerful body), the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves. The fact that it is the Catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon. To label this as propaganda against Catholics seems to miss the truth about what the Catholic Church has done at times; its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted. Yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching - &#39;if we do not study the past, we are bound to repeat it&#39;&#34;,
   &#34;I have NOT seen this movie, but I must. Having read all three of Thor Heyerdahl&#39;s books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku) I am actively looking for a copy of this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thesis that Peruvians migrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Considering that this crew had NO GPS, and only an old fashioned valve (tube) radio with a 6-watt output, their voyage was heroic to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be interested in buying it.&#34;,
   &#34;I didn&#39;t even want to watch this movie after reading Maltin&#39;s review and 1 1/2 star rating. I watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than I expected. I would give it 2 1/2 stars out of a 4 star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all. If you don&#39;t know much about religion, you will miss a lot. I graduated from high school the year the movie was made, so maybe I can relate to it better. Yes, there is some pretension in the movie and it&#39;s weird to some extent, but that was the 70s so what do you expect. I can see why people might not like the movie; however, I cannot understand people saying it is boring. The movie is anything but boring. You will either hate it or love it. If you find it boring, you are probably brain dead.&#34;,
   &#34;This film gave me nightmares for months and I&#39;m 17. This is the scariest movie ever made! That is no exaggeration!! I saw this movie at school in English lessons and no one else was scared which amazed me. After reading other reviews I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only person who found this so scary!!&#34;,
   &#34;Drew Barrymore was excellent in this film. This role is the type of role you don&#39;t normally see Drew play. Her typical role is as a woman looking for love. The storyline is also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Holly is implicated in her mother&#39;s murder she moves to L.A. She moves in with a guy who becomes her lover. But her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused. It is then revealed to her lover that she has Multiple Personality Disorder. After that another woman becomes paranoid when she&#39;s around her. In the end though, they find out the truth.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is an exact copy of a TV series on Indian television channel doordarshan Which was aired at least 15 years ago. The series was known as &#34;gubbarre&#34; meaning balloons. Each episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and &#34;convincing&#34; Abhay Doel does a good job but he doesn\&#39;t fit the role of a &#34;normal&#34; and &#34;third class&#34; guys(as he calls himself in the movie). In fact Shayan Munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the Abhays role but Shayan just doesn\&#39;t have the talent to pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest watching the series if it is available. It is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction. The acting of the TV actors was much better than these &#34;stars&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour(or 45 minutes) story to 2+ hours. So it has to get draggy. Even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movies is good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven\&#39;t watched the original TV serial. The script and the ending of the serial was much better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#####SPOILERS AHEAD######### #####SPOILERS AHEAD######### #####SPOILERS AHEAD######### #####SPOILERS AHEAD######### #####SPOILERS AHEAD######### THe ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him. HE is aware and tell her that he doesn\&#39;t want to be &#34;repayed&#34; and never helped with that intention. The director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film. The original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement. The deliver just wasn\&#39;t right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But personally I feel this is a pathetic copy. No credit should be given to the director/scriptwriter. The story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of PRemchand munshi. I am not sure if this is premchand munshi\&#39;s story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi\&#39;s and other great Hindi writers stories.&#39;,
   &#34;Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness &amp; death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950&#39;s stardom. Dorothy Malone is in excellent form, and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated &amp; falls just short for his role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas. Amazing how well drunks can drive in this film &amp; also how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see why the cast is so good &amp; actually production wise this film is very good. You can tell Bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today&#39;s young viewers would not realize what they are. Film does a good job telling a story &amp; actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made- though Written Beyond THe Wind would be a good title.&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;m no big fan of Martial Arts movies, but the video shop was nearly empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it free when the other films I&#39;d rented, either way I rented it. I absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22 year old Biochemistry and Accountancy students) spent the half hour after the film making strange Kung Fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other. I can&#39;t explain it (well maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, skinny bloke kicking big bloke, beating him, kicking bigger bloke etc film ends. Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.&#34;,
   &#34;Now this is more like it! The first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting, but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid, thoroughly enjoyable, hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is just full of great stuff, brimming with creativity, and it&#39;s less of a spoof on 80s movies at the same time. The scenes in Hell are great, and so are the ones in Heaven. There&#39;s really no shortage to the mad-cap adventurous romp that this one promises, and you will never see another movie like this. Even the hammy final act of the movie isn&#39;t as bad as the first one, being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely cliché repertoire of family fun movie bliss. And even Keanu Reeves, despite looking about 30, isn&#39;t that bad here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a good deal to me.&#34;,
   &#34;A featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don&#39;t make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is. Lively action and spectacular stunts - for their day - give this movie some real zip. And there&#39;s some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads. Quinn makes a good villain also, although his role is completely overshadowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#39;t be fooled by Maureen O&#39;Hara&#39;s tough broad role, this is as sexist as any Hollywood movie of this era. You might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made, but it&#39;s still hard to get past. For all the heroism and gruesomely adult off-screen situations, this is still little more than an adolescent good time.&#34;,
   &#39;The last time I saw the movie I was around seven years, so my opinions might be jaded over time. At the time I enjoyed the filming that switched between cartoon and live action. At the time I felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life. Also I felt glee when after Captain Contagious kidnapped the heroine (a princess or toy shepherdess) the tables the were turned on him. Unfortunately the producers never decided to transfer this movie to VHS, so all I have are twenty year old memories. I am sure that if I saw the movie again I would consider it corny and sappy, but I really enjoyed it the movie at the time.&#39;,
   &#39;Antonio Margheriti\&#39;s &#34;Danza Macabra&#34;/&#34;Castle of Blood&#34; is an eerie,atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts.It looks absolutely beautiful in black &amp; white and it has wonderfully creepy Gothic vibe.Alan Foster is an English journalist who pursues an interview with visiting American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe.Poe bets Foster that he can\&#39;t spend one night in the abandoned mansion of Poe\&#39;s friend,Thomas Blackwood.Accepting the wager,Foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins!The film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me.The crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable.Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter Elisabeth Blackwood.&#34;Castle of Blood&#34; is easily one of the best Italian horror movies made in early 60\&#39;s.A masterpiece!&#39;,
   &#34;My all-time favorite movie. Oscar-caliber work by everyone involved, both in front of and behind the camera. The screenplay is perfect, and works out the relationship between Lady Caroline and George Briggs in a completely satisfying way, unlike the novel. The care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer Peter Barnes, and the intense visual beauty should have won Oscars for director Mike Newell and cinematographer Rex Maidment. It is Josie Lawrence&#39;s best work by far, and transformed my opinion of Joan Plowright. Having watched this movie at least 50 times, I can find no fault in it. The music, by famed composer Richard Rodney Bennet is a marvel.&#34;,
   &#39;Aside from the great movie METROPOLIS, this is about the oldest pure sci-fi movie. While at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad, it is a great film for two reasons. First, it is extremely original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films I can think of that are anything like it. Second, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible--using matte paintings, models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. Sure, you could sit back and knock the film because, by today\&#39;s standards, the effects are only so-so. But, you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences. In many ways, the sets look highly reminiscent of the &#34;modern cities&#34; featured at the 1939 WORLD\&#39;S FAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question &#34;are people really THAT stupid or are we destined for greatness?&#34; The end result seems to be a little of both! How true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note: I saw this twice on TV and just a short time ago on video. All three times the sound and print quality stank--particularly the sound. If this is available on a DVD, hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning. As the sound on the video kept cutting out, I really would have appreciated this!&#39;,
   &#39;Those childhood memories...when things were new, and we were filled with curiosity about the world around us; as we took those initial first steps in the long journey we call life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the initial memories I have from childhood is this animated program &#34;Galaxy Express 999,&#34; about a young boy named Tetsuro, who goes on a train ride around the galaxy, in the hopes of gaining a mechanical body in order to avenge the senseless death of his mother at the hands of cold-hearted, trophy gathering mechanical hunters. Accompanying Tetsuro on his journey is Maetel, a woman of exquisite golden beauty who reminds him of the mother he lost all those years ago...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the early-80\&#39;s, as a boy who attended kindergarten and the early years of elementary school in Seoul, South Korea, &#34;Galaxy Express 999&#34; was a phenomenally popular animated program imported from Japan, which inspired young boys who tuned in to dream of countless adventures in their often tumultuous and exciting journey through life that awaited them. The memories of tuning into this animated program on weekdays between 8 to 9pm before bed time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were some wonderful memories, never to be had again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I moved to America, and while residing here for over 2 decades, I sometimes wondered about that time and place, in a country thousands of miles away divided from America by an enormously vast ocean, of this childhood program, with its hit theme song, and of the boy named Tetsuro, his protective companion Maetel, the enigmatic train conductor, and of the spacefaring train Galaxy Express 999.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many, many years passed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last summer while I was in Korea, I was able to track down a copy of the original &#34;Galaxy Express 999&#34; (1979) on DVD, and it brought back a lot of nostalgic, heartfelt memories. &#34;Galaxy Express 999&#34; remains as captivating as the first time you discovered it all those years ago, opening up those nostalgic memories of new discoveries, an important stepping stone for young boys who tuned in and embarked on their life\&#39;s journey into manhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here\&#39;s to wonderful memories. &#34;Good-bye, Maetel. Good-bye, Galaxy Express 999...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good-bye, to my childhood.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#39;,
   &#39;While the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing for self-respect and anger management is hardly a new thing, the story is given a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diana has trouble at school. She just can\&#39;t stay away from fighting. At home her father is constantly putting her down. Her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be easy to call this movie a &#34;Rocky with girls&#34; i guess. But that is not at all what this is about. The story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy. That way you can deal with more problems at once. First the problem of her not being accepted because she\&#39;s not a girlie-girl, and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she\&#39;s a girl at all. It\&#39;s also a story about how a purpose can change someones life. How positive things can make you grow. I don\&#39;t want this to sound pretentious, because the movie doesn\&#39;t feel pretentious at all, but what i\&#39;m saying is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the lead. It\&#39;s a shame really that she has become stuck in the &#34;tough girl&#34; typecasting now, because that\&#39;s really not what her part in &#34;Girlfight&#34; is all about. Sure she\&#39;s a female boxer, but rather it\&#39;s the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist, but it\&#39;s lifted way above the crowd by Rodriguez\&#39; performance. I rate this 7/10.&#39;,
   &#39;This film reinvents the term &#34;Spring Breakumentary.&#34; Hans, the fat one of the group, displays his talents as this generations Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, &#34;the King of the $1 bet,&#34; shows he\&#39;s not in Kansas anymore by consistently upping the stakes. Kyle\&#39;s laugh is truly infecting, and offers a little eye-candy for the ladies as well (as does Matt). The dwarfs, while having their moments, did not do justice to the Mexican hat dance like it deserves. And last, we have our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all of us bumbling, stumbling, gangly, pale folk who are still searching for that special someone. And that hope, is a little place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster just missed the theaters, this is a must rent, as we can all relate to one of these Spring Breakumentarions.&#39;,
   &#39;My expectations were quite high for this film. Everyone I know who saw this film at the cinema told me that everyone there stayed through the credits because they were so touched. My expectations could not have been any higher, anything short of wonderful would have disappointed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was anything but disappointed by this movie. I loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a Hollywood film tends to include. In this film characters worked through problems they had had for decades, they worked through prejudicm, they learned to open up. But it did not come easily, and not just by singing a song or two. It was painful, it took arguments, it took confrontations. It felt like real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One scene that really stuck out to me was the scene in which Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sjöholm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is lovely, and you could tell that she was not just lip-syncing to a previous recording during filming (which I often find in other movies), she really sang with her whole body and soul. You could feel what Gabriella was feeling in that scene. Had this movie been made in Hollywood her song would most likely have been sung toward the end, and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways, as well as making the other people in the village realise a thing or two. Instead it came halfway through, and it did not bring any solutions. Her husband did not become overwhelmed and realise what he\&#39;s putting her through, and it didn\&#39;t seem to make anyone else in the village more open minded. It was beautiful, it was pure and it was touching but it did not magically solve all her problems. That felt real to me, that\&#39;s probably what would have happened in real life. The whole movie felt like real life to me, nothing neatly wrapped up but everything with a sense of joy and happiness. You rarely find a movie which feels so realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few things that bothered me, but hey, no movie is perfect. If you haven\&#39;t already you should go see &#34;As it is in Heaven&#34; and be filled with a joy for life, a sense of hope and the feeling that you\&#39;ve been touched on a level movies rarely reach. You will be sad, pained, happy and a dozen other emotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir there would be no more wars. Having seen this film I might have to agree.&#39;,
   &#39;Also known as &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; in the US. During WWII British Peter Carter\&#39;s (David Niven) plane is shot down in combat but he survives. He meets and falls in love with lovely June (Kim Hunter). But it seems a mistake was made in Heaven--he should have died! A French spirit comes to get him but he refuses. He is soon to plead his case in front of a Heavenly Tribunal that he should be allowed to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film. The script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight-faced and it\&#39;s beautifully directed--the scenes on Earth are in breath-taking Technicolor (I\&#39;ve never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in Heaven are in black and white! Niven is a little stiff at times but Hunter is just great (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help Niven. The imagery throughout is amazing (especially the staircase and during the final trial sequence) and the special effects are truly great (considering the age of the film). There\&#39;s also a very strange sequence when Niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful, thought provoking film--highly recommended. This remains unknown in the US which is a shame.&#39;,
   &#39;Sports movies have never been my thing, but a small handful of them work for me. The best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, the Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama, and an outstanding first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels is both realistic and involving, that is enough so to make it a memorable film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is strait forward enough. Diana Guzman, is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her picking fights in the hallway she is close to expulsion. As a possible means of unleashing her anger, she signs up for Boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training (at the wishes of there father).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the course of ninety minutes, we the viewers see something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it in her body as well as her behaviour, especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her, and she gets into it. There is not a bad scene or a lame/contrived moment in the film. The only error that I would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note. Aside from that, Girlfight is a great movie.&#39;,
   &#39;Freebird is the perfect marriage of road trip comedy, gang caper, &#34;stoner&#34; film and feel-good British movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the brilliant lead characters that set this movie apart from other films in this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and make their characters hugely likable and realistic. The main story centres around their road trip from London to Wales, and the adventures and mishaps that occur along the way. This small film also has a great heart - it is not just for bike fans, as it bases around the character\&#39;s relationships with each other including dreams and regrets, such as Gary Stretch\&#39;s Fred longing for the family he left behind. The cinematography is also great - a love letter to the Welsh countryside as well as capturing the grittiness of London streets and typical pub life in the Welsh country towns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stylish, slick, fantastic soundtrack, likable characters and funny storyline - I would recommend Freebird in a heartbeat!&#39;,
   &#34;Curly Sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drifter. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets by being small time con artists. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in a pricey parking garage while Curly will scream about lawsuits and traction to the intended victim. It happens to be a very upscale lawyer named Grey (Kelly Lynch) who is appropriately appalled at what she has done. Not only do the scammers make some cash, they get to spend the night at Grey&#39;s plush apartment. Even then, Grey feels she owes them more so the three of them hang together for a spell. Grey only knows the lucrative law business and nothing about life. Who better to teach her than Bill and Curly, those savvy experts on life&#39;s realities? But, all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a couple of con men. Or is there? This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple but much edgier, of course. Belushi gives a rare touching performance as the down on his luck con and Lynch is luminous as the snooty but soft touch lawyer. John Hughes, as writer and director, shows us his magic touch once again, as the script is lively and unpredictable. Just watch Curly and Bill take Grey out for a night, with no money, and see the humorous results. Do you long for happy endings, long promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments in between? This is your made-to-order movie.&#34;,
   &#39;I live in Missouri, so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me, this brought it home. That two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of FDNY and NYPD did, just to document the horror that unfolded on that day. This film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings.&#39;,
   &#34;I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago. With little money for entertainment, I rented it for my fiancé and I to watch on a bone chilling winter&#39;s night. The movie I had wanted was gone, so I rented this instead, not expecting much, and was very much surprised with how good it was. I just recently watched it again, and loved it every bit as much as the first time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those unfamiliar with the story, it&#39;s about Scottish outlaw Robert Roy MacGregor, a cattleman and folk hero. From the little I know about the man and his story, liberties have been taken with the facts, but it&#39;s a movie, not a textbook, and so the filmmakers can be excused. Basically, the plot of the movie is that Rob Roy borrows money from the Marquis of Montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from. But, his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest. Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis, and Mary, his wife, suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham, a smarmy Englishman with no soul. Atrocities ensue, until, in an immensely satisfying conclusion, Rob carves Archibald up like a Christmas turkey. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many great performances in this movie, but allow me to touch specifically on a few. Liam Neeson, as usual, is fantastic, a sexy beast you can&#39;t take your eyes off of. Honestly, this man is like ice cream: even when he&#39;s bad he&#39;s good. His Rob Roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him, in the best way he knows how. Jessica Lange, as Mary, gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering, dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure. You just know she doesn&#39;t take any b.s from Rob, or anyone else for that matter. Tim Roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil Archibald, yet somehow, it works. All the posturing and preening, combined with some wicked dialogue, result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory. Combine all of this, and the stellar work by other supporting players, with the luscious scenery of Scotland, and you have what amounts to one really, really cool movie. If you haven&#39;t seen this, I highly recommend that you do.&#34;,
   &#34;This is a better than average silent movie and it&#39;s still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents. However, if you aren&#39;t yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other films before watching this one. That&#39;s because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots. But, despite this, it&#39;s still a good film and kept my interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief. Despite this, she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life. However, the rent is due and there&#39;s no money, so the lady is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal. Unfortunately, the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can&#39;t make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man&#39;s date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her! What to do now--given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her?! Well, see the movie yourself to see how it&#39;s all resolved. I DIDN&#39;T like how they handled the husband, as it seemed awfully predictable and clichéd. However, once he was out of the way, I do admire how the film also DIDN&#39;T give up a by-the-numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very good film worth seeing, but certainly not great.&#34;,
   &#34;Scott Bartlett&#39;s &#39;OffOn&#39; is nine minutes of pure craziness. It is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours, and the first true merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema. There&#39;s no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature \x96 particularly the human face and form \x96 to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating these biological phenomena into the highly-industrial form of modern technology. In a sense, the film represents the merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. This theme connects loosely with the subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubrick&#39;s &#39;2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),&#39; and, indeed, Bartlett&#39;s opening sequence of images \x96 flashing colours before a close-up human eye \x96 recalls Dave Bowman&#39;s journey through the Stargate. The visuals are richly-coloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video, as though we&#39;re sitting too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, the end product was recorded from a TV monitor}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There appears to be some confusion about the film&#39;s release date. IMDb lists the film as a 1972 release, but both the National Film Registry and the National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as the correct year. Perhaps this disparity reflects the time between the film&#39;s completion and its first public screening. Either way, the visuals are distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and some brisk techno music wouldn&#39;t have gone amiss, either! &#39;OffOn&#39; captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from the warped perspective of a computer processing too much information. I had a thought \x96 and please don&#39;t laugh at this free-thinking interpretation \x96 that an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earth&#39;s television signals might very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery that couldn&#39;t possibly make any coherent sense. Perhaps this is where Mankind, with all his technology, is eventually heading, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.&#34;,
   &#34;This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It&#39;s...terrible. But it&#39;s so good! It&#39;s probably best if you don&#39;t watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you&#39;re going to be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro&#39;s fantastic hair/bad English, you&#39;re in for a real treat. The harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, unless you&#39;re having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you&#39;ve got hours of entertainment ahead. I&#39;d only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be a bit careful, because Goro&#39;s Japanese fans were a bit upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (He wasn&#39;t really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).&#34;,
   &#34;I have always like this great baseball movie! It has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of My favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this movie is Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza, and Matthew McConaughey! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has great special effects and acting from all of the film&#39;s actors! The baseball scenes are all realistic! The music by composer Randy Edelman is very good and it fits the film very well! Some of the actors who reminded Me the actual baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson&#39;s Ray Mitchell character reminded Me Royce Clayton, McConaughey&#39;s character reminded Me of Steve Finley, and Jay O. Sanders&#39;s commentator in My opinion resembled how Al Hrabosky looks today. This is a fantastic movie for non and Baseball fans and I strongly recommend this film!&#34;,
   &#39;Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi made many films together, but on the whole (interestingly enough) Karloff usually is the better man of the two. The real exception is &#34;The Black Cat&#34; (1934) where Karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult, and Lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life. But more usual is &#34;Black Friday&#34;, where (whatever his motive) Karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while Lugosi is a murderous thug. In &#34;The Raven&#34; Lugosi is a sadistic surgeon, who blackmails Karloff to assist his evil plans until Karloff finally has had enough. Rarely are they both negative characters totally. In &#34;The Body Snatcher&#34;, Karloff does kill Lugosi, but Lugosi is trying to blackmail him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film, which I feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies I have mentioned. In it Karloff\&#39;s Dr. Janos Rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the &#34;official scientific community&#34; for his theory that a rare form of Radium is in Nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago. He has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by Sir Francis Stevens and his wife Lady Arabella Stevens (Walter Kingsford and Beulah Bondi), and has another scientist, a Frenchman named Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi), Rukh\&#39;s young wife Diane (Frances Drake) and a friend and protégée of the Stevenses named Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before they leave, Rukh is warned by his mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn\&#39;t and it may end in tragedy. He tries to dismiss this, but he is worried by what she says, his scientific standing, and whether or not he is going to get his due credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he gets is a disaster. He finds the substance, but is infected by it\&#39;s remarkable radioactivity. He finds that he is slowly burning up, and if he tries to touch people or animals they die. He\&#39;s actually built up a friendship or understanding with Benet, who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for Rukh to use to counter the danger. But there are two things that are unbeatable here. The antidote can only last for a certain amount of time, and has to be replenished. And the radioactivity has affected Rukh\&#39;s brain. He is increasingly jealous of Diane\&#39;s friendship with Ronald (encouraged, unfortunately by Sir Francis and Lady Arabella), and he is equally upset that (due to his having to pretend to have died - the effects of the radioactivity are like that) Benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that &#34;Radium X&#34; is giving to man. Soon Rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives, ending with his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film certainly picked up on science to an extent. Madame Curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with Radium. Few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936, but some idea of it was coming out. The wave of murders by Rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a &#34;curse&#34; on the expedition. Of course, with the idea of a &#34;cursed&#34; expedition (on the continent of Africa) for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago, financed by a titled Englishman, we have entered archeology not physics or geology (paging Howard Carter and Lord Carnaevon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, Benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths, and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in England. During the Whitechapel Murders, Sir Charles Warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was Jack the Ripper. It turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes. But the idea did not die. Jules Verne used it in his novel &#34;The Brothers Kip&#34; in 1899, and here Dr. Benet uses it. As this is a science fiction story, he finds the image of Rukh on the the plate, but Benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is good on many grounds, the most interesting that for a change Karloff and Lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other. There is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films. The other performances are good as well, in particular Ms Kemble Cooper. She is best remembered as Basil Rathbone\&#39;s frightening sister (Jane Murdstone) in &#34;David Copperfield&#34;. Here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end, and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target.&#39;,
   &#39;An Insomniac\&#39;s Nightmare is the story of a man\&#39;s plunge into insanity. Having chronic Insomnia, Jack is plagued by hallucinations; causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We find out interesting things about Jack near the end, and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a &#34;happily ever after&#34; Hollywood ending. Wrong. This is New York City, the place where nobody sleeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tess Nanavati (Writer and Director) has herself a good film in \&#39;An Insomniac\&#39;s Nightmare\&#39;. A talented filmmaker and writer (she made this film right after her High School Graduation), she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I watched this short film I was constantly uncomfortable; between the music, bleak scenery, and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by Dominic Monaghan (as Jack), I desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it.&#39;,
   &#39;So, what\&#39;s the reason? Is there some sort of vendetta against this AWESOME show or somebody involved therein? Why would the best show I\&#39;ve seen in years be canceled? I\&#39;m addicted. I saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately loved it, and watched it every week. Then it went away, and I tried to Tivo it, but it wasn\&#39;t being aired. So I forgot about it for awhile, until I found the episodes on ABC\&#39;s website. Now I want MORE. I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was refreshing to see something as well-rounded and developed as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and House for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. My wife loves Grey\&#39;s Anatomy for its &#34;realism&#34;, and I do love/hate the show, but it could not be farther from real for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can go wrong, does. But for once, there\&#39;s a drama that\&#39;s REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are really out there, and I relate to each and every one of them. I can\&#39;t seem to get enough. I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and continue this show. Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama out there. This could be one of the best shows of all time. If somebody will just let it.&#39;,
   &#34;The lead characters in this movie fall into two categories: smart and stupid. Simple enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays a hapless, dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit. When he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil, former boss, the situation gets out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Standa is genuinely (but endearingly) stupid, his buddy Ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time. Without Ondrej, Standa might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success. With Ondrej, life will never be boring, but it sure won&#39;t be without a lot of headaches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, an evil genius type who degenerates into some Hitler-esquire delusional tyrant. Zdenek and his henchmen try to kill Standa to keep Zdenek&#39;s secrets safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment. The best Czech movies I have seen are: 1) Peli\x9aky and 2) Tmavomodrý Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you have seen the absolute best of Czech cinema.&#34;,
   &#39;Fever Pitch has many of the clichés we have come to identify with Hollywood romantic comedies: a relationship between two people with little in common, the secret he\&#39;s been hiding that she discovers, the inevitable breakup, and the very public \x96 well, I won\&#39;t go any further but you get the picture. In spite of its predictability, it works, especially if you love baseball as I do, though I\&#39;m not quite as obsessive as Ben Wrightman, a Boston schoolteacher played by Saturday Night Live comedian Jimmy Fallon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adapted from a novel by Nick Hornby by veteran screenplay writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, Ben is a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan whose Uncle gave him season tickets when he was seven years old and he\&#39;s been kind of stuck emotionally at that point all of his life to the detriment of his relationships with women. Ben is not just a fan but a &#34;fanatic&#34; who travels to Fort Meyers, Florida each winter for the Red Sox Spring Training games and never misses a home game during the regular season. His family does not consist of parents or siblings but the fellow groupies who attend each game with him and his bedroom is not a place to sleep but a Red Sox museum to visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he falls for business consultant Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore), he is threatened with the possibility of having to grow up but Ben is not quite ready to do that. He would rather attend the Yankee series than go with her to Baltimore to meet her parents or to go to Paris with her and miss the Anaheim series. It takes his relationship being on the verge of dissolving, for him to stop and think about his priorities, especially when a pint-size Dr. Phil wannabe asks him, &#34;You love the Red Sox, but have they ever loved you back?&#34; While the premise of Fever Pitch is that some things are more important than baseball (perish the thought), you would never know it from the way things turn out. Of course, to any one familiar with the history of the Boston Red Sox, it is a team that will break the hearts of its most die hard fans -- but this is 2004, the year the curse of the Bambino came to an end and as the Red Sox move to a new level, Ben might just do the same. Both lead performances are excellent and the Farrelly Brothers even manage a pretty gross gag. While Fever Pitch will never be mistaken for an art film, it is a joyous romp that will have to go down as one of my guilty pleasures. Go Blue Jays!.&#39;,
   &#34;And I am a Nicole Kidman fanatic. I would pay to see and hear her read the Moscow phone book, which, for all I know, she may have been doing when she was speaking Russian in this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All four of the principals are excellent, but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie, this one asks too much of the viewer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have been very funny (which it is in parts) or quite frightening (which it is in one scene) but the director didn&#39;t seem to know which way to go.&#34;,
   &#34;Ossessione&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luchino Visconti&#39;s debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti&#39;s compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, it&#39;s incisive and essential, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.&#34;,
   &#34;Funny, sexy, hot!!! There is no real plot but you needn&#39;t anyone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so the naked or almost naked girls and the typical fights between college-cliques need no development!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the whole seems to be known from simply every film in this category but the reissuer reached the goal that this film can be recognized out of thousand others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing I&#39;ve got to say. Unbelievable funny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;ve got to see it!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are young and you want know more about the female body you&#39;ve got to see it twice&#34;,
   &#34;A kid with ideals who tries to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man, because of the system. A system who hides the truth, and who is violating the rights of existence. A boy who, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands up, and tells the truth. A family who is falling apart, and fighting against it. A movie you can&#39;t hide from. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things, that you till the day you die will hope have never happened for real. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can&#39;t do anything, and a boy with, I am sorry, balls, a boy who will not accept things, who will not let anything happen to him, a kid with power, and a kid who acts like a pro, like he has never done anything else, he caries this movie to the end, and anyone who wants to see how abuse found place back in the 60&#39;ies.&#34;,
   &#34;After viewing several episodes of this series, I have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. Here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still they can only -almost - make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog is good! The male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions. Most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable side-kick. And most of the episode plots come across as palatable. So what could be wrong? How about the, the female characters and the cosmeticly perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good - series, in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader. Why, I ask, why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen. These actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles, and you don&#39;t actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments. A blind person could tell. Just listen to them talk. They deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a 16 year old at the high school prom. Who would believe these women are Phd scientist, senators, corporate executives and medical doctors?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nut shell, if the producers have their choice of a Stockard Channing or a Morgan Fairchild, guess who they&#39;ll choose - every time? And of course, the series suffers for it. Too bad!&#34;,
   &#39;This picture in 1935 walked away with all kinds of Ocars for Best Director, John Ford, Actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max Seiner. Victor McLaglen,(Gypo Nolan), &#34;Call Out the Marines&#34;,\&#39;42, gave an outstanding performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a rough and tough crowd who were all fighting for a cause and at the same time getting poorer and poorer with plenty of drinking. Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend in order to take a trip with his gal to America and a new way of living. Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher),&#34;Guadalcanal Diary&#34;,\&#39;43, gave a great supporting role as the leader of the Irish rebellion and was anxious to capture the informer of his group. Gypo Nolan becomes haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel just like a Judas. Great film for 1935 and wonderful acting by McLaglen, but rather depressing in every aspect of the film.&#39;,
   &#39;Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie. It has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a &#34;dead zone&#34; in the middle where all the heavy, &#34;she\&#39;s breaking up with me&#34; stuff happens, but other than that it continues to be funny until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the Red Sox, it\&#39;s not overloaded with sports. You don\&#39;t have to be a fan to enjoy this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course that\&#39;s easy for me to say: I\&#39;ve been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barky&#39;,
   &#39;In &#34;Brave New Girl,&#34; Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings &#34;The Yellow Rose of Texas&#34; at a local competition, and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia. From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace. The acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding, as well as Nick Roth The camera work was really done well and I was very pleased with the end (It seems a sequel could be in the making). Kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production. Quite a gem in the film archives.&#39;,
   &#39;If you go to this movie expecting something it isn\&#39;t, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the &#34;iceberg effect&#34;. On the surface, its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie. If this would be written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast paced, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) can very well pass you by. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate. Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie. The camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something to be desired in American movies as of late). Although, at some parts it may get a little raunchy, gruesome and too heavy for some audiences, the movie never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as &#34;needs improvement&#34; is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite fitting, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip). The flooding of imagery and dynamic... color palettes adds another &#34;artistic&#34; aspect to it, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand. However, that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch, and not one you\&#39;ll quickly get bored of. 8.5/10&#39;,
   &#34;From the filmmakers who brought us The March of the Penguins, I guess that came with plenty of expectations for The Fox and the Child. From the harsh winters of the South Pole to the lush wilderness in France, the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale, which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters, Renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it, played by Bertille Noel-Beuneau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story&#39;s frankly quite simple, and at times this movie would have looked like the many Japanese movies which children-miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust, and how they go about hanging around each other, dealing with respective adversaries and the likes. Here, the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains, which provide for plenty of beautiful picture-postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while we indulge in wistful scenery, the characters don&#39;t get to establish that level of trust from the onset, and we have to wait a few seasons to past, and 45 minutes into the film, before they find a leveler in food. The child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement, but the fox, well, as other notions of course. While I thought the narrative was pretty weak, unlike March of the Penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of what&#39;s happening on screen, what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie, tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator, and a prey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the two, more tension and drama was given to the latter, especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves, and granted, those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it. Otherwise, it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other, in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing. There were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren&#39;t really quite suitable for children, as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly, so parents, you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a film, I would&#39;ve preferred this to be a complete documentary ala The March of the Penguins, but I guess the way it was resented, probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature, and that some things are just not meant to be, and should stay as such. Decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between Bertille Noel- Bruneau, and the multiple foxes that played Renard.&#34;,
   &#39;Probably the two main significances of &#34;Elmer\&#39;s Pet Rabbit&#34; are that the wacky leporid featured in &#34;A Wild Hare&#34; now has a name, and that he utters his famous &#34;Of course you realize this means war!&#34; for the first time. Mostly, the Termite Terrace crowd was still trying to figure out what exactly to do with this long-eared rascal. It\&#39;s certainly a must-see for hard-core fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to take interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But make no mistake, it\&#39;s quite hilarious what Bugs Bunny does to the eternally gullible Elmer Fudd. Clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon. I recommend it.&#39;,
   &#39;I wasn\&#39;t born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily I managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90\&#39;s and the rest is history......I was hooked. The premise was pretty simple; two hardened Nemesis agents, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling ( William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) Doctor and Biologist (Sharron Macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. Whilst making their escape, their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the Himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio, thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and I guess it was its relatively short lived, one season run that has set it up for cult status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monty Berman, the producer, was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in Episodes such as &#34;Happening&#34; ( a studio deputising for the Australian outback) and the \&#39;snow\&#39; sets of &#34;Operation Deep Freeze&#34; and &#34;The Beginning&#34; but if you can get past this, and focus on the characters and the story lines, the show was really a lot of fun. It had a great mix of adventure, and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from William Gaunt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about Anthony Nicholls awful wig!!). They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. I have to say, I was always a Richard Barrett fan - I loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn\&#39;t cross, and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on TV. I have also followed Bill Gaunts career with interest since. However, Craig Stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and I am sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with, including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O\&#39;Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notable episodes for me were : &#34;Auto Kill&#34;, &#34;The Interrogation&#34;, &#34;The Fanatics&#34;, &#34;The Mission&#34; and &#34;The Gilded Cage&#34; but I am sure every one has their personal favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time, or to re watch it after many years, remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and I don\&#39;t think I will ever tire of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!&#39;,
   &#39;If you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by Tom Robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole-hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art. The actors and the direction of this film are both good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trouble with the film, as I can see it, is that Robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond Hollywood\&#39;s capabilities at the time this film was shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given both the irreverence of today\&#39;s movies, as well as the willingness and abilityof today\&#39;s audiences to delve into the bizarre, I think &#34;Even Cowgirls... would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released.&#39;,
   &#39;Finally, an indie film that actually delivers some great scares! I see most horror films that come out... Theatrical, Straight-To-DVD, cable, etc... and most of them suck... a few are watchable... even fewer are actually good... Dark Remains is one of the good ones. I caught a screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival... the audience loved it... and my wife and I loved it! Having no name actors, I assume the budget on this film was pretty low, but you wouldn\&#39;t know it... the film looks fantastic... the acting totally works for the film... the story is good... and the scares are great! While most filmmakers focus solely on the scares, they often forget about story and character development, two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently. Brian Avenet-Bradley must know that character and story are important. He develops both to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters, and are therefore more scared when they are in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching horror films that cost anywhere from $80 million to $5000 to make, I find &#34;Dark Remains&#34; to be one of the gems out there.

   &#34;My first impression would be this is Beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting Grendel and dragons intact, making it one thrill ride from start to end. Written by Frederic Lanoir and Arthur Qwak, the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story, with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around, which can either be wastelands, or globes of greenery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story&#39;s a simple one, which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon&#39;s unwanted visit to plunder and destroy, and the resident knights have all but been annihilated. Enter the king&#39;s granddaughter Zoe (Marie Drion) who gathers Lian-Chu (Vincent Lindon), a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant, and his partner-in-arms Gwizdo (Patrick Timsit), who balances the partnership with his cunning brain. Lian-Chu and Gwizdo (together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement, but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free, hence their career in monster-extermination which doesn&#39;t exactly pay off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s basically the whole gist of it, but what makes this film a spectacle, is its CG graphics, which is solidly rich, detailed, and an eye-popping marvel to behold. It has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action,, and during those fight sequences, there&#39;s nary a boring moment. Photo-realistic moments of non-existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make-belief, and it&#39;s easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three-suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs (here&#39;s having at you George!) And I couldn&#39;t get enough of the finale battle as well, though the usual brick-bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer-animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of Pixar&#39;s. And this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of Zodiac: The Race Begins and Legend of the Sea can learn from \x96 to keep the story effectively simple, and let your moving artwork do all the talking. Definitely highly recommended!&#34;,
   &#34;There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can&#39;t really do that can I? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and then pee. I&#39;m serious. Don&#39;t watch this movie if you&#39;re easily offended by profanity, sex, nudity, homosexuality...and everything else associated with nature. Being a woman, and that might not even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all their other debuts, I think Baseketball is the prize winner. I&#39;m laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie!! That&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say. It&#39;s sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I&#39;m one of those people, like Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak. So I&#39;m keeping it professional. Best movie. Heck yeah!!&#34;,
   &#39;The first time I saw this film, I was in shock for days afterwards. Its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention, helped by good acting and some really intriguing music. The ending, quite simply, had me gasping. First rate!&#39;,
   &#34;I really enjoyed this movie. It took a pretty dark story-that of Shakespeare&#39;s Macbeth- and wrapped it in a quirky, often funny and poignant modern yarn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern NYC and Macbeth&#39;s Scotland together under one roof. The opposing worlds act to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love Harold Perrineau as the Chorus, a part which doesn&#39;t exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up. The ending stands out among little indies I&#39;ve seen for it&#39;s closure and originality.&#34;,
   &#39;A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident. When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live. The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes to us from director Rob Schmidt, who made &#34;Wrong Turn&#34; (a film I have not seen). With only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, I was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting Schmidt to be a &#34;Master of Horror&#34; in only the most liberal sense. My apologies to him for my underestimation. As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue of the &#34;right to die&#34; is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device. However, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves. Once the horror elements show up, the film goes from &#34;decent&#34; to &#34;spectacular&#34;. Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense. I was a little creeped out at times (which is good) and most of all: the gore is in extreme abundance! I read a review of this episode prior to watching it, where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of &#34;Hellraiser&#34; in this. Through the first part of the show, I had no idea what they were talking about. Then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of &#34;Hellraiser 2&#34;. However, I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film. I can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than &#34;Hellraiser 2&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look. I didn\&#39;t watch it a second time, but I think the beginning would make more sense if I had (not that it\&#39;s confusing). The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if I felt bad for him. He\&#39;s somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story, if you will. I feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he\&#39;s completely unlovable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Stuart Gordon episode may be better and I\&#39;m excited about the &#34;Washingtonians&#34; episode, I think I could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine. When legends like John Carpenter let me down (again) I get a bit worried about the genre\&#39;s future, but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt comes along and gives me hope. This one is a keeper, and please bring Schmidt back for season 3!&#39;,
   &#39;Only after some contemplation did I decide I liked this movie. And after reading comments from all the other posters here, and thinking about it some more, I decided that I liked it tremendously. I love American films - probably because they are so narrative. They usually have a well-defined beginning, middle, and end. &#34;Presque rien,&#34; on the other hand, makes no such attempt. I disagree with other posters that say it\&#39;s \&#39;too artsy.\&#39; In every way, this film is meant to evoke your sense memories. So often throughout the film you feel like you\&#39;re there... you feel the summer sun, the breezes, the heat, the winter chill, the companionship, the loneliness, etc., etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every way, the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them. After I finished watching it, I felt the same. But upon some reflection, I recognized that this is how the movie had to be: the \&#39;story\&#39; isn\&#39;t the narrative, it\&#39;s the emotions you (the viewer) feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lighting, scenery, and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they\&#39;re rich, exquisite, and alive with detail and nuance. Although I normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot (after all, isn\&#39;t a movie \&#39;supposed\&#39; to tell a story), this film is definitely one of my new favorites.&#39;,
   &#39;I am embarrassed to say that I missed &#34;The Mother&#34; when it was in theaters. I saw it this evening on DVD. I gave it a 10 vote, one of the very few I have given here. This English independent is filmed with such great care and quality. It drew me in relentlessly. The story, low-keyed and purely human, is brutally honest and utterly absorbing, thanks to the acting of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is stunning. The score is hard-wired to the plot. The storyline is epic, brilliantly clothed by writer Hanif Kureishi in mundane lives. This story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting. And some of those big issues are highly controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards won, despite many nominations. It is simply one of my all-time favorite films.&#39;,
   &#34;Alan Curtis has a loud, violent sounding argument with his wife, slams out of his apartment, has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar (run by Andrew Tombes, in a nice villainous part for a change), and returns to find his wife dead and the police, led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him. His attempts to prove his alibi - that he was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that he can think of (Tombes, Elisha Cook) claims there was never any such person. He ends up with no alibi, although his secretary (who secretly loves him) Ellen Raines believes him. Convicted after a trial, he is awaiting his death sentence. Raines starts going out after the truth, discovering that Gomez has some doubts of his own. She also finds an ally in a friend of Curtis, Franchot Tone, who was apparently out of town the night of the crime. Will she clear Curtis in time? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish (the great noir writer Cornell Woolrich). As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich (LEOPARD MAN, THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES, REAR WINDOW, NO MAN OF HER OWN) one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere. The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate, sending him messages that she arrived, if he still has her jewelry. The mentalist may really be able to predict tragedy - or was he plotting the murder of his old partner, now an oil millionaire? Did a leopard kill the young women, or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge? Is the young woman, claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck, actually an impostor? Here it is Raines and Gomez (with an assist by Tone) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if he did see her, why is nobody else able to recall seeing her? The problem with the story really is Curtis&#39;s personality - he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit. In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed. However, in defense of Curtis&#39;s collapse, it also happens to other people in various films: Gary Cooper, in MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first, until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility. But Curtis just seems to give up. In normal circumstances Raines, Gomez, and everyone else would not care if Curtis didn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the film survives this weakness. The slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session. Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again. And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film. If it is not as great a film as DOUBLE INDEMNITY or THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE or THE MALTESE FALCON, it holds up pretty well until the moment Curtis and Raines are reunited at the end.&#34;,
   &#39;Thankfully saw this on a plane to Singapore recently (thought I\&#39;d missed it at the Cinemalaya filmfest). Paris, je t\&#39;aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 mins each) by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary Paris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my fave segments is \&#39;Parc Monceau\&#39; by Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), which was done in one continuous shot and features Nick Nolte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Coen brothers\&#39; \&#39;Tuileries\&#39; starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious ! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in \&#39;Place des Victoires\&#39; was haunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress/druggie in \&#39;Quartier des Enfants Rouges\&#39; to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in \&#39;Quartier de la Madeleine\&#39; was pretty surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a cute couple in Wes Craven\&#39;s \&#39;Pre-Lachaise\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired French boy in \&#39;Faubourg Saint-Denis\&#39;. But despite the many portrayals of young love, a more mature execution by Gena Rowlands in \&#39;Quartier Latin\&#39; was equally aww-inducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is perfect for those with ADHD because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also a number of memorable quotes. One in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days: &#34;In pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love.&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;This beautiful story of an elder son coming home, and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from, is poignant and moving. It shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the Western world, with a sense of family that we have lost. The story is beautiful, sad, and at times funny and comic. It has a feeling of realism that we don&#39;t seem to see any longer in our western movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is unusual, in that as the movie progresses, it almost gives the impression that it is not acting, but a documentary of ordinary people. This is brilliant directing and movie making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to see more movies by this director.&#34;,
   &#39;I was very surprised with this film. I was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his &#34;marie&#34; the little girl he was separated from. The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do. Actually i was expecting &#34;paulie wants a cracker&#34; jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference. So if you wish to see a good &#34;animal that talks&#34; film check this one out, much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well.&#39;,
   &#39;Belushi at his most ingratiating and Courtney Cox before Friends has a small role. I often think Belushi is under-used in Hollywood and this film role is one of his best. For those of you who watch his TV show, this is a very different and likable character. The movie itself is not earth shattering, nor is the message new but rather it is sweet and endearing. The supporting cast of familiar faces and unfamiliar names is a perfect balance although Lovitz\&#39;s whining can get tiresome, and Michael Caine\&#39;s charming spiritual guide has a slightly sinister if not well-meaning edge. Hamilton, as Belushi\&#39;s wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonders why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and not terribly convincing at the &#34;prom queen&#34; who got away. Nevertheless, a nice way to spend two hours.&#39;,
   &#34;Savage Island&#39;s raw savagery will scare the hell out of you! Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the boy of the estranged Savage Family is run over by some city slicker tourists, Pa Savage wants revenge, and he&#39;ll stop at nothing until he gets it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks proper knowledge of film. The filmmakers chose the lighting and camera-work in order to reflect the dark, murky, and egdy mood of the story; in other words, to obtain a certain aesthetic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the film has won SEVERAL horror film festival awards.&#34;,
   &#34;When I first got my N64 when I was five or six,I fell in love with it,and my first game was Super Mario 64.And I LOVED IT!The graphics were great for it&#39;s time,a good plot,great courses and above all,the best music I heard in a Nintendo game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t remember the plot completely,but I think Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser,and Mario has to rescue her.The object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle.Each had about five or six challnges to get the stars.There are secert parts of the castle,where you can get more stars.But of course,you have beat Bowser.*I think there are three levels to beat Bowser on* Lets start with the characters.Mario is the main character,and gets helpful advice from Toad,so he is basically one of your only alliances.I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end.The main villain is Bowser,and there are a bunch of other characters like Boo and Goomba.The characters are really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next,how about the graphics?People say Gameplay is more important then the graphics,and I agree completely.But with he great plot,there are great graphics.Especially for it&#39;s time.I have a whole bunch of other Nintendo games like 007 and their graphics don&#39;t compare to Super Mario.Bright colors,great effects and awesome sound effects.I found the graphics in the water courses very very good.Next to the Bowser world ones,it has the best graphics in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now,the music.This is my favorite part of the game.Growing up,when I played this at a young age,I&#39;d gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep.Especially the music from Jolly Roger Bay,which was peaceful and wonderful.There are others that are great too,especially in,once again,the worlds with Bowser,are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer,and I love it.This game gets 10/10 or *****(5)/*****(5) GO PLAY THE GAME!&#34;,
   &#39;I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers. I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot - I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared. Yet I remember it pretty well, with a nice twist or two, and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm. Michael Pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career, and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead. I definitely recommend it as a rental, although some of the themes, which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989, now may seem tame, which is a shame, considering that contemporary &#34;edginess&#34; is often just used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamoring just to get noticed.&#39;,
   &#39;Serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction. Known as &#34;chapter plays,&#34; they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called &#34;chapters&#34; or &#34;episodes.&#34; Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week. The serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again. Serials were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The golden age for serials was 1936-1945. This was one of the best of the era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zorro has been seen in many films, but Reed Hadley (&#34;Racket Squad&#34;, The Undying Brain) was excellent in the role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action is constant, and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zorro triumphs, as he always does.&#39;,
   &#39;Picture the scene: a mountainous alien landscape. Twin moons illuminate the blood red sky. The Tardis lands, and out steps the Doctor, a middle-aged man in a Victorian frock coat, and Rose, his companion from Earth. A flicker of recognition crosses his face. &#34;Well, I never! Its the planet Saurious-7. Where I fought the warlike Kraggartians. They tried to use giant Skinkons to take over the planet.&#34;. The girl sniffs the air. &#34;Can\&#39;t we go, Doctor. I don\&#39;t like the look of this place. I keep thinking we\&#39;re being watched.&#34;. The Doctor wags a disapproving finger. &#34;Don\&#39;t be silly, girl. I wonder if the King and Queen of Cordaraby City remember me from my last visit. Come along, Rose, come along!&#34;. He strides off, the girl struggles to keep up. High on a hill, sinister red eyes regard them with hatred... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was not how \&#39;Rose\&#39; began back in 2005, and thank heavens for that say I. Unfairly derided at the time of its original U.K. broadcast, \&#39;Rose\&#39; can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode, putting \&#39;Dr.Who\&#39; back where it belonged, as one of the B.B.C.\&#39;s flagship programmes. The mistakes made by the McGann T.V. movie were well learnt. Instead of trying to shoehorn the new \&#39;Who\&#39; into existing chronology, it represented a fresh start for the series, beginning with shop girl Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) going about her daily routine. One day she goes to the basement to find a man named Wilson, and then the trouble begins. Mannequins come to life and attack her. It is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger ( Christopher Eccleston ) that she is saved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story, slight though it may be, is more than adequate as a starting-point for the series. The Autons are, of course, an old villain ( this was their first appearance since 1971 ), but no references are made to their past appearances - another wise move. The finale effectively recreated the famous scene in \&#39;Spearhead From Space\&#39; when shop window dummies sprang to life. As the Doctor, Christopher Eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessors, preferring a modern leather jacket to the Doctor\&#39;s traditional period clothes, but this made him more accessible to the show\&#39;s hoped-for new audience. Billie Piper confounded her critics by making a big impression as \&#39;Rose\&#39;. Also good was Noel Clarke as her boyfriend \&#39;Mickey\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there was an added emphasis on special effects, but then there needed to be - the wobbly sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on 21st century television. What is more important is how good a script this is. Ten million people tuned in to see the new Doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\&#39;Dr.Who\&#39; was back - and back with a bang!&#39;,
   &#34;This is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made! Although I&#39;ve only seen forty minuets of it and I must say this is a good movie. The plot if funny and because there&#39;s sex around pretty much every corner of this movie. It&#39;s really funny and I don&#39;t see how anyone could NOT like this film. I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie. It has one slightly sick scene in it (trust me, it&#39;s not very pleasant) but apart from that this is a great movie. I rate this movie an 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. PLease if your a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where there&#39;s pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie. It WILL please you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#34;,
   &#39;This was another World War II message to the soldiers and to the Allies to be careful about spreading rumors. These were called &#34;instructional&#34; cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny-looking main character called &#34;Pvt. Snafu.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of us have imaginations, along with fears and what-have-you, and that\&#39;s what happens here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with &#34;five.&#34; You can start panics and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. That includes losing confidence in your country and your cause, as pointed out here in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy. That\&#39;s still being done today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;We lost the war,&#34; declares one big baloney near the end of this cartoon. Amazing how some Americans still haven\&#39;t learned. This cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today. As I write this, there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today and some people still think the &#34;War On Terror&#34; is just a bumper sticker slogan. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writer, the famous &#34;Dr. Suess,&#34; uses analogies of &#34;hot air balloon juice&#34; here to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (his real name) you know the rhymes will be clever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing hilarious here, but it wasn\&#39;t meant to be. You have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during World War II. People forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning. It was a tense time&#39;,
   &#34;me and my sister saw the premiere last night... it was so good we were glued for the whole thing.. hahaha..i think I&#39;m hooked for the season!!.... they have some really good actors in this thing.. the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i don&#39;t really understand how they&#39;ll keep it stretched for a whole season.. there will probably be some big twist tho..i cant wait till Tuesday.. finally Jeremy sumpter who is he? i can tell hes going to be big!! he was soo good we fell in love with his character right away.. cant wait for the next episode.. GO Jeremy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Aimee&#34;,
   &#34;I bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. I am glad I did. It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game. I thought the graphics were the best I have ever seen in a movie/game remake. The bonus levels were very hard! The sniper one I think was too hard, it made me so frustrated I didn&#39;t play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I might change was the upgrade system. I didn&#39;t notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn&#39;t seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter. I really liked the Q copter. I think the developers did a good job.&#34;,
   &#34;I liked the movie, first of all because it told an interesting story, but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much-longer story. Since the book is over 400 pages, that makes sense. It spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictional South American country, also a lot to fit into the time available. I think it would have been much better as a six-hour mini-series than it turned out as a 140-minute movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#39;s rushed, the story doesn&#39;t skip so much that it gets confusing. What is told is told fairly well. One fault is that Clara&#39;s supernatural powers appear inconsistently; either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie, or they should have been left out. Two more faults (which could be spoilers): Esteban&#39;s eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly, and Ferula&#39;s curse seems to wear off, even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is excellent. Glenn Close, as the tormented spinster Ferula, is outstanding. Jeremy Irons, as the brutal self-made rich man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, as the main character Clara, is great, although she&#39;s often even better than she was in this movie. There were many well-performed smaller roles too. The biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach; each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent.&#34;,
   &#39;Often laugh out loud, sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys -- Lemmon a neurotic clean &#34;house husband&#34; and Matthau a slob sportswriter -- who decide to live together to cut down on expenses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely photographed and directed. The script is very barbed -- that is, there\&#39;s always more than one side to almost every line. Particularly funny scene involves 2 british sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem amused by everything anyone says, but when Lemmon busts out his photos of kids and, yes, ex-wife-to-be, he has the girls sobbing along with him before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very entertaining.&#39;,
   &#34;Obviously, there wasn&#39;t a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production. But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot. I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other (great) Chinese films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything...&#34;,
   &#34;I own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. Prince doesn&#39;t stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he&#39;s a musician and I feel like that is what he displayed here, he&#39;s just the best one to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a great movie with even better music. The principals and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.&#34;,
   &#34;I think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it&#39;s worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself. Apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick...Cheers&#34;,
   &#34;City Hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country, state or any sort of major political table. Granted it shines on New York City which is a huge political arena, especially nowadays, but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor&#39;s right hand. Director Harold Becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done Mercury Rising, Malice, and Domestic Disturbance and I think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault. I mean City Hall is meant to be a political drama, not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out...what else...or rather who else...Al Pacino. The film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city. As the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss, and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city. As events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely hate talking about Al Pacino. I mean even if ONCE he didn&#39;t give a good performance how could I ever say it? The man is acting royalty. There is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor. In City Hall Pacino plays the New York City mayor. He has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician. He also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches I&#39;ve ever seen at the &#39;James Bone&#39; Funeral. I re-watched that speech four times and the first time I watched Pacino give it, my mouth gaped open and I almost wanted to stand up and applaud. Its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by Pacino. John Cusack, who I really do enjoy as an actor, turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun. He is kind of the focus of the film and him and Pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance...he seems like he&#39;s trying too hard. His accent is just bizarre, and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn&#39;t get seem to pull it off. Maybe he was having an off film. Bridget Fonda, on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows Marybeth Cogan. Her performance is very similar to Cusack&#39;s in that she just doesn&#39;t seem to find her groove with this character. Danny Aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia Frank Anselmo. Martin Landau makes a decent cameo as Judge under scrutiny Walter Stern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with City Hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors. Everyone is...okay. There is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy. And of course you have Al Pacino in a rather small supporting role but he&#39;s absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film. It almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them. So City Hall could have been this huge political epic drama/thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one BUT it still has to be seen for Pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics. If you just won&#39;t see this movie than find Pacino&#39;s speech at James Bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn&#39;t seem to give it justice but you can see what makes Al Pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it. If you&#39;re a John Cusack fan which I am...he&#39;s definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice. A decent movie but unfortunately potential loss. 7.5/10&#34;,
   &#34;I loved this movie!!! The characters were people that you could feel for. The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together. The most touching scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather&#39;s house. I laughed in parts, cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. In fact I&#39;ve re-watched it about 5 times. A definite must see for total romantics.&#34;,
   &#39;I first rented this film many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it. Just recently, feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that I\&#39;ve immensely enjoyed in my lifetime, I decided to give &#34;Erendira&#34; another look. And I\&#39;m glad I did, as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about a teenaged girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O\&#39;hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burns down her grandmother\&#39;s mansion after which the grandmother, played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas, forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though, inspite of the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content. The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which, by the way, is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is very atmospheric, arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not to the point of, say, a David Lynch film. It\&#39;s also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments from previous viewers below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion, quiet and melancholy, adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. The cinematography of the rural places, many of which are in the desert, is quite superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film moves at a nice pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again, just because it makes you want to do that. For me anyway, it really is that compelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college, and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. Por ejemplo: &#34;El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba.&#34; (&#34;The world\&#39;s not as big as I thought&#34; - i.e., It\&#39;s a small world.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which, upon drinking, is immensely satisfying, however, you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren\&#39;t more bottles just like this one.&#39;,
   &#39;Well not actually. This movie is very entertaining though. Went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the &#34;I think there might be something in my eye&#34; routine. The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides. In fact all the characters are great. The movie is not overly funny or sappy, good flick to go see with the wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in All 8/10....note * I am not an easy grader. Thats all from BigV over and out!&#39;,
   &#34;Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I don&#39;t know how he does it. I read books constantly but if there is a movie with Will Smith I will watch it. He has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen yet. I watched it on Saturday and I still cannot get it out of my head. AMAZING and sad all at the same time. Thanks again Will. You must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie. You cannot miss a thing. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your man/woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle. WELL Worth the money that you will pay to watch it.. don&#39;t wait for it to come on TV.&#34;,
   &#39;My Take: A goofy, yet imaginative mess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keanu Reeves (Yes! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the time-trotting adventure comedy BILL AND TED\&#39;S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now a cult classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted are given much more to do than travel through time. They might as well travel Heaven and Hell too! During the beginning of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for a &#34;Battle of the Bands&#34; competition which may make them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, many years in a futuristic civilization, the time-wizard from the first film (the always watchable George Carlin) is running a university praising Bill and Ted\&#39;s names. There, an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October) plots to get rid of the two idiot rock-stars once and for all. So he sends two identical android replicas (In the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us\&#39;s) to do the dirty job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There after, Bill and Ted experience death and must find their way through Hell, with inhabitants that happens to include the duo\&#39;s worst memories, and then through Heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends... and their show. Along this whacked-out voyage, they play board games with none other than Death (William Sadler, from DIE HARD 2), reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic THE SEVENTH SEAL, aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOGUS JOURNEY\&#39;s array of exuberant special effects gimmicks aren\&#39;t up to to-date standards, and even some of the humor and the for-the-time look and feel are somewhat dated (to be honest, the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year, even for the 90\&#39;s). But with it\&#39;s no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction, BILL AND TED\&#39;S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative, and yes, bogus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.&#39;,
   &#34;Hidden Frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was Gene Roddenberry&#39;s mission. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war, and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other Trek series and movies. The production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved, the stories are more complex, and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive. In season 6 episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the biggest space battles in Trek history. The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting. The real draw to Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds, but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters. There are also nods to other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know. I recommend any Trek fan to check out Countermeasures and you will be hooked!&#34;,
   &#39;Recently I was looking for the newly issued Wide Screen DVD of FLY AWAY HOME and came upon interesting title that I had never heard of: GREY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough Film caught my attention (he responsible for such fine films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN, and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the screenplay was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This &#34;Special Edition&#34; was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under $10.00 -- so I chanced it &amp; bought it. WOW! What a beautiful film. Pierce Brosnan stars as Archie Grey Owl, a real life trapper in the 1930s, who came to love and respect the wild lands of Canada, and worked to help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond film) gives a shaded, warm, powerful performance as does Annie Galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land -- especially the beaver. A fine score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and beautiful photograhy by Roger Pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film. AND the extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real Grey Owl as well as audio commentary tracks by Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other fine additions PLUS options for those having access to a PC with DVD-ROM features. GREY OWL has been released directly to DVD in the United States -- a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood\&#39;s lack of interest in distributing something that isn\&#39;t loaded with a lot of violence and sex. This is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion -- and a whole new love and understanding for beavers! GREY OWL is a very fine film -- worth checking out! This is one I look forward to sharing with others.&#39;,
   &#34;For a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance. It is done with style and class showing Modesty&#39;s early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world. I think it is a very honest/true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer Peter O&#39;Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice. She acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool/intelligent/innocence. And full marks to Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more believeable to have a new face creating the part. I&#39;m looking forward to the next film.&#34;,
   &#34;This is a really strange film--and that is NOT a bad thing. It is a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless AND a fairy tale. I&#39;m sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange, but I loved it. Once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people (not actors) and gets a great ensemble-type performance. Although not nearly as sad as Umberto D, both movies have a very similar point to make--this one just does it in a very absurdist way. Ignore the cheesy special effects--after all, it was made in the early 1950s and special effects aren&#39;t terribly important anyway (or at least they shouldn&#39;t be in films). Instead, just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride. Unless you are a total curmudgeon, you&#39;ll have a ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, since I first reviewed this film, I have seen another DeSica directed film that is an absolute must-see and that is THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US. While not a fantasy or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, a great film nevertheless.&#34;,
   &#34;A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad. A great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a Twin Peaks-ish influence in director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do. J.T. Walsh (RIP to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is Dennis Hopper. It&#39;s such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz. I&#39;m sure he has his followers, though. In all, this is a great film that shows you that you don&#39;t need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film.&#34;,
   &#34;This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his earlier films--a cast with some stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of America--and they&#39;ll stop at nothing to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents. They know she is a link in a long espionage chain. Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation--a small-time pickpocket (Widmark) is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying. Widmark thinks it&#39;s just another purse he&#39;s ransacked--only later does he realize the seriousness of what he&#39;s stolen. Now it&#39;s Widmark on his own--with Commies and the FBI hot on his trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish. Although she didn&#39;t get top billing, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon. Seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the script and directing go, they are very good--but with one small exception. At first, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted. It&#39;s one of the few times on film you&#39;ll see a woman punched square in the mouth! Now THAT&#39;S tough. Later, inexplicably, they become amazingly close--too close to be believable. Still, with so much great drama and such an effective Noir-like film, this can be overlooked. See this film.&#34;,
   &#39;i two came home from school fast as i could to catch HRpuff and stuff on t.v. that was the most fun time in my life is to watch HRpuff and stuff on t.v. growing up still love it today i am 46 years old. this year......&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;The Grudge&#34; is a remake of Shimizu\&#39;s own series of popular Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new, so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place: he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride. He uses commonly known clichés associated with ghost stories but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner. The nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. At the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience (the same way a comedy is to make people laugh), this movie succeeded with flying colors. I watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one. It probably doesn\&#39;t play as well in your living room.&#39;,
   &#39;Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun\&#39;ichi Yamamoto &#34;Meatball Machine&#34; is apparently a remake of Yamamoto\&#39;s 1999 movie with the same name. I doubt I\&#39;ll ever get a chance to see the original so I\&#39;ll just stick commenting on this one. First of what is &#34;Meatball Machine&#34; ? A simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore. It\&#39;s not something you\&#39;ll end up writing books about but it\&#39;s nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Meatball Machine&#34; follows the well known plot. Boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. Boy finally meets girl. Girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. Boy, in turn does also transform into said thing, and goes on a quest to save his love. Will he succeed? Who gives a damn, as long as there is carnage and death I\&#39;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is simple, relatively clichéd but it does it\&#39;s job well enough setting the movie\&#39;s course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters. There is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives. And yes it too luckily shows more violence. I\&#39;m happy. Acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film. It\&#39;s not exactly painful for the ears but it\&#39;s not exactly good either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie\&#39;s main attraction besides the violence and gore (like I haven\&#39;t mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. Done by Keita Amemiya who\&#39;s work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. The necroborgs as they are called in &#34;Meatball Machine&#34; look stunningly detailed. Without the usage of CGI Amemiya\&#39;s designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal, painfully awesome in their appearance. Able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws, rocket launchers, blood-firing shotguns and so on and so on. Though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are A-movie class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Meatball Machine&#34; is &#34;Tetsuo The Iron Man&#34; mixed up with &#34;Alien&#34; all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. It\&#39;s an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking.&#39;,
   &#34;SOLDIER is not as bad as many have made it out to be. I found the film to have some of the sacarstic, cynical humour like that in Paul Verhoven&#39;s Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One particular trivia-bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo&#39;d onto his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For the oblivious ones out there, Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Batty&#39;s elegiac last lines in Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside android troops like Roy is mind boggling to say the least. Maybe script writer David Peoples was nostalgic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll give this one 3 out of 5.&#34;,
   &#34;In the rapid economic development of 1990&#39;s in China, there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, was not without disasters, because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, not only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was ignored in the resurgence, and facing extinction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie.&#34;,
   &#39;Off the blocks let me just say that I am a huge zombie fan so I don\&#39;t make statements like the above lightly. Secondly let me say that this is an Italian zombie film and Fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to Bruno (Rats, Night Of Terror) Mattei. This is no Dawn of the Dead folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films I have ever seen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script is wonderfully horrible. Just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote (&#34;Let\&#39;s try putting these two molecules together&#34;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zombies come in all varieties. From moaning shufflers, to machete wielding maniacs, to birds! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gore is plentiful. Legs are bitten off, arms amputated, stomachs burst open. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pace is fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there\&#39;s the head in the fridge. Oh the head in the fridge! One of the greatest moments in horror since Ash got his hand possessed in Evil Dead 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know already whether you\&#39;re the sort of person who\&#39;s going to like this sort of film. Get some mates and some beer and you\&#39;ll be in for a fun night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the head in the fridge?!?!?&#39;,
   &#34;Hak hap(Black Mask)is what I&#39;d like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Sure the plot has been tried and heard before, (A biologically engineered soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of supermen that decides he feels that killing and brute force aren&#39;t the ways to settle every thing and becomes a pacifist, and a librarian. But when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police -his best friend is a cop- he becomes the black mask.) the style that the movie goes for, very visual, works and at least for me is entertaining. I love martial arts movies that are a spectical. People flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop. But that is what this movie is about anyway right, a showcase of Jet Li doing what he does best, and that is spectacular showmanship of his skills, which to say the least are top notch. As with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time, these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical feats. But I must say, even with the large holes left in the plot (like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape? Who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment.......ohh well suspension of belief I guess) , the movie to me stays interesting. It is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter. But still all around a great high paced action movie.&#34;,
   &#39;I just watched &#34;The Last Wave&#34; in my school\&#39;s fine arts library. It\&#39;s intriguing, like all Peter Weir\&#39;s stuff, but it\&#39;s not always as attention-holding as I would have liked. I found myself fascinated by the ideas being thrown at me (because they are very well handled by the film\&#39;s director Weir)but at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them. AKA I got a little bored in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot surrounds an Aussie lawyer who becomes obsessed with certain dreams he has which link him to an Aborigone group he is defending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out with an intense weather sequence and has some very awesome mood effects throughout (most notably the bizarre, &#34;belching&#34; sound design)and strong direction; but it just didn\&#39;t entertain me like Weir\&#39;s later films do. I might just need to watch it again though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good film about obsession and mystery. Because, in the end, the mystery that exists between the whites and the Aboriginies offers some very severe consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God bless Peter Weir, though. For him alone this film is worth watching ... very organic director. Like an Aussie response Malick! I\&#39;d give it a 7 because it\&#39;s got enough great ideas to overcome its boring moments.&#39;,
   &#39;Seldom do I ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that I must speak about it immediately. This movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic. I happened to see the dubbed version but I\&#39;m on my way right now to grab the DVD remaster with original Chinese dialogue. Still, the dubbing didn\&#39;t get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour: &#34;Poison Clan rocks the world!!!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story-telling stays true to Chinese methods of intrigue, suspense, and inter-personal relationships. You can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed. It\&#39;s like watching real animals fight each other, but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms. Such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination provides for a serious dose of old Chinese culture and I recommend it solely on the basis of the film\&#39;s genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution. ...Of course, if you just want to see people pummel each other, along with crude forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!&#39;,
   &#34;This is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells etc. I will not try to explain it in more details, you will simply have to see it for yourself: You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember watching this as a kid in the 80s (with Swedish voices). I have talked with a few people who were also children in the 80s and they loved it also! I must admit that the education-part of the episodes didn&#39;t get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of educating children while they have fun is wonderful. I have recently seen a few episodes; there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5&#34;,
   &#34;Well the main reason I tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park fame. However as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly. From the subtle gestures towards a joke, to the blatant toilet humour throughout, along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo. This film could ruin event he sternest mans poker face, let alone his poker underwear. Some of the funniest blink and you&#39;ll miss it jokes ever portrayed in Hollywood, along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just goes to show that not only is Trey Parker adept at writing he&#39;s not too shabby at the old acting game either. I was surprised with the amount that I was absorbed in this film. However I&#39;m quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet, here in the UK. Sort it out boys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am, and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits, and occasionally snorting into my lager. All in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear! However I&#39;m sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices.&#34;,
   &#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artisticly shot, actors portray exactly their role. You get a real feeling watching Lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around. A sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again. All in all I have seen this film at least 10 times. And can VERY well say that Prix De Beute&#39; (the Beauty Prize, Miss Europe) is a MAJOR favorite in my silent film collection. The expressiveness of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;The Man in the Moon&#34; is a beautifully realistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent. Director Robert Mulligan magically re-creates screenwriter Jenny Wingfield\&#39;s autobiography of her childhood with gorgeous cinematography and a haunting, lyrical musical score. This film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting films in recent times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is incredible, all the acting first rate, especially Sam Waterston and an astonishing performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Man in the Moon&#34; was a limited release in 1991, and you will love the fact that most of you\&#39;re family and friends will probably have never heard of it. Buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art. This film is truely the essence of filmaking at its finest.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Holly&#34; is an issue-driven film, but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental. At its heart is it is a character-driven film, which wouldn\&#39;t be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing, everything is forthright and well-done. The contemporary classical score may put some off at first, but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout. This film, which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight. Kudos to those who managed to get it made.&#39;,
   &#39;Virgil Manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural farmhouse.Chasing his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his property,Manoven glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the woods.He reports the crime to the police but there\&#39;s no body to be found.Troubled by disturbing visions,he investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turn\x85&#34;Soft for Digging&#34; is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to spare.This minimalist film is almost completely devoid of dialogue.Some scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is excellent.The location sets provide plenty of creepiness:the eerie Maryland woods rival those used in &#34;The Blair Witch Projcect&#34;.Give this strange horror film a chance.9 out of 10.&#39;,
   &#34;The pilot is extremely well done. It lays out how the characters bond in future episodes. I don&#39;t think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. It displays remarkable creativity on the writers part. Although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode, a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot. An example would be Ross and Rachels future relationship. Even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared, it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great start to an unbeatable comedy!&#34;,
   &#34;I caught a bit of this concert on public television and knew I had to have it. The boys give everyone at the Royal Albert an excellent, often thrilling performance complete in every way. Pure, too - no synth, no smoke-shrouded lasers and strobes, no grandiose entrance (and an unstoned, serious, and appreciative audience, all of whom left their bottle rockets at home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a Cream fan (or if you&#39;ve only heard of them); if you&#39;re a blues fan; if you&#39;re a rock &#39;n&#39; roll fan; you will not be disappointed when you view and listen to this DVD. You also will never lose this DVD because you&#39;ll never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get their own!) It&#39;s too good and too replayable; you&#39;ll want to keep it within easy reach.&#34;,
   &#39;Perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it\&#39;s not it\&#39;s certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what Brian De Palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork. First there is the director\&#39;s touch of Brian De Palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever, there is the superb performance from Al Pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana), there are the many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one with the chainsaw, the one in where Tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people\&#39;s living rooms), there are the many superb one-liners (count how many times the word &#34;f*ck&#34; is used), there are the superb little details (the Pan American-globe that screams &#34;The world is yours&#34;) or the great discomusic from Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named that isn\&#39;t sublime here and it easily is along with &#34;The Godfather&#34;, &#34;Good fellas&#34; and &#34;White heat&#34; one of the best gangstermovies ever made!&#39;,
   &#39;Sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment. Most DeMille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. The action takes us from an Indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with Jean Arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives. This is followed by her and Cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured. Later comes a protracted battle with the Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.&#39;,
   &#34;Caught this film at the Arizona International Film Festival. I wasn&#39;t expecting a lot (though the festival&#39;s director told me it was one of the best films submitted). Five minutes into it I was sold. Shot in B &amp; W on a shoestring budget, this film is hilarious. The acting is solid, the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid. The acting is probably the biggest revelation, since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting. Not this one. It features one of the most convincing, endearing and funny portrayals of a character with Tourette&#39;s Syndrome I&#39;ve ever seen. The plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous. If you get the chance, see this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (hope I got that right) deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience.&#34;,
   &#39;Ironically for a play unavailable on film or video for so long, ARMS AND THE MAN has remained fairly constantly available on stage over the years since its debut in 1894 - in no small part because it has aged so well as a solid satire on the nature of heroism and the business of war. Whenever the world sinks into strife, ARMS AND THE MAN seems to soar as ever more timely and relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the play which Oscar Strauss converted (leaving out most of Shaw\&#39;s best ideas) into the successful operetta, THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER (when Hollywood got to *that,* they left out the last vestiges of Shaw rather than pay him for the rights - he was, by then, an Oscar winner in his own right). While the best of Shaw has always been his ideas and his dialogue rather than his bare plots, in ARMS AND THE MAN, the plot sparkles as well and the master manages happy endings for all concerned. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter), daughter of an officer and the wealthiest man in her town, is betrothed to a dashing officer in the Bulgarian cavalry and all seems well until a bedraggled Swiss mercenary (Pip Torrens) from the other side climbs up her drainpipe fleeing from the battle where his army has been routed. As usual in a Shaw satire, nothing is as it first appears and societal conventions are stood on their head in the light of simple - and not so simple reason. There are no &#34;good guys&#34; or &#34;bad guys,&#34; just people of a variety of classes getting by on the best of their wits - just like life only better - and naturally with Shaw, the wit is finely honed from all concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early (1932) motion picture version (from Shaw\&#39;s own screenplay) of this most traditional and traditionally funny of Shaw\&#39;s stage satires, and one of his first to make a real hit on this side of the Atlantic, has long been among the missing. Shaw didn\&#39;t sell the screen-rights to his plays - only licensed them for 5 year periods, and it appeared that with rapidly evolving sound technology making 1932 films look primitive only a few years later, Shaw did not renew the license to show it. Consequently, we\&#39;re immensely in the BBC\&#39;s debt for finally putting out their 1987 broadcast version in a DVD box with nine other sparkling plays. (Somewhat sadly, PYGMALION, that many view as Shaw\&#39;s best, comes off least well on this set in a production with Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even paired, as it is on its DVD, with the less impressive one act, A MAN OF DESTINY, ARMS AND THE MAN makes for a real treasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helena Bonham Carter went on, after cutting her teeth on televised roles like this, to a major film career that will bring many viewers to this early role. They should not be disappointed, for Ms. Carter gives a performance in line with the layered innocence audiences have come to expect from her, but under James Cellan Jones\&#39; somewhat pedestrian direction (and despite the BBC\&#39;s uniformly beautiful and well observed physical production), the role\&#39;s mischievous fire (and her outrage at being underestimated in the last act) is banked at only about 80% of it\&#39;s potential. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much the same can be said of the real star of the piece, Pip Torrens, as Bluntschli the &#34;Switzer.&#34; It\&#39;s a fine, appealing performance, but doesn\&#39;t go for the physical comedy implicit in the early scene where the young soldier can barely stay awake despite his mortal peril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These reservations notwithstanding, this is a solid production of a wonderful play transferred to the small screen with aplomb. It deserves to be seen widely and, ideally, prompt an even livelier big screen remake with the style and zest of the recent remake of Wilde\&#39;s AN IDEAL HUSBAND. Virtually *any* ARMS AND THE MAN is to be cherished, and with a lot of luck perhaps we\&#39;ll even eventually get to see the original 1932 version. \&#39;Till one or the other surfaces, this production will please anyone who loves good Shaw.&#39;,
   &#34;I can&#39;t believe that they took this off the air. Especially, when they only had a few more episodes left. My daughter, sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show. We were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings. It is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning. We had a right to see the end. I wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system. They could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about. This could also help promote a new show. People would see it and wonder what it is. Not only could you see what the viewers are watching, you could also use this as a tool for free advertisement for TV and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back!!&#34;,
   &#39;Not sure if it was right or wrong, but I read thru the other comments before watching the short.I have to say I disagree with most of the negative comments or problems people have had with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a first time &#34;Lone Wolf&#34; director/producer,I like to see things that I can aspire to,not necessarily from the pro\&#39;s, but by people just getting their feet wet like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If indeed this is also from a first-timer,as I read,I applaud the effort.Marvelous job then in that respect! There were some comments about the music.I thought it was quite nice for the piece.Some say it kind of droned along for a while, but I found that created tension without(us)necessarily being conscious of it, and when he pulled the gun out and the guitar started crunching chords,it was like we knew there was a train on the tracks, but realize it is just now moving. Yes there is a 180 degree slip/clip in there, but shi* happens.Did anyone else see Hugh\&#39;s dirty shirt turn white (near the end,in the rain) in &#34;Australia&#34;? Look how much money and people were behind that movie! Give the kid a break for Gods sake! All in all I think it was very well done. Only 2 things I would have mentioned are hardly worth mentioning-Don\&#39;t walk up to a shiny brass picture frame with the camera, and I would have just displayed the splatter at the beginning shots to a still shot, so people wouldn\&#39;t necessarily know what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience so far has taught me that it\&#39;s not that it\&#39;s hard to make a movie,it just takes time to learn how to do it,then the time to actually do it, and then you better take some more time still to think of all the details you\&#39;ll need to have shot before you call &#34;post-production time!&#34; IMHO, it looks like director/writer Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this indeed is his first report card, I\&#39;d give him an &#34;A&#34;. The rest of you report to the principals office for a whuppin\&#39;.&#39;,
   &#39;Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, &#34;Hey this looks like fun,&#34; - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... I cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then cried some more. Once Jonni Kennedy\&#39;s &#34;time was up&#34; he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie shows life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young French girl, France Dalens, whose father is an official for the colonial (French) government, and whose family is one of the few white families around. It gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated. It&#39;s a sense consistent with another movie I&#39;ve seen about Africa in a similar time period (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It&#39;s not just an impression -- things do happen in the movie -- but the plot is understated. The viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers&#39; forced upon him, although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman&#39;s visit to south-western Cameroon as an adult provides some perspective.&#34;,
   &#39;I looked at this movie with my child eyes, and I wasn\&#39;t disappointed. The story is well-known, some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal)... And I don\&#39;t want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut. This one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Briefly : it works, it is funny and it is a &#34;must-see&#34; with your children (they\&#39;ll like it).&#39;,
   &#34;Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date. The movie has the same feel as the comic book, staying true to the color scheme. The Batman series has climbed, fallen, climbed and fallen again. Dick Tracy has true staying power as something that both adults and children can enjoy. The good guys triumph over evil, without blood and gore to get the point across. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best job by far is Warren Beatty who just epitomizes Dick Tracy just as he did with Clyde Barrows. I can&#39;t wait until it comes out on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is wearing thin.&#34;,
   &#39;Let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 o\&#39;clock P.M. one night, I could not fall asleep until about 3:00 A.M.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brief review may contain spoilers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m a long-time fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say this is the best episode I\&#39;ve seen. I\&#39;m not saying everyone should feel this way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family, watching over my own father, comatose in the ICU before he passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality: he is a salesman who\&#39;s identity has been mistaken for that of a man named Kevin Finnerty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time ten minutes had gone by, I knew either Tony was dreaming, or I was watching some other show. It wasn\&#39;t like the normal Sopranos and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or &#34;Kevin&#34;) looks into the sky at a &#34;helicopter spotlight&#34; and we see prodding through it, a doctor with a flashlight. We see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one I just stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony has come out of the coma for only a moment. His boys take A.J. home and Carmella, overcome by stress, breaks down in the hallway: a signature moment in the episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the remainder of the episode, we cut in between the real world: the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma, and Tony\&#39;s alternate reality, which parallels what\&#39;s going on both in his mind and in the real world around him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the stellar point in the episode: after A.J. finishes telling his mother he\&#39;s flunked school, she walks in to see Meadow sitting at Anthony\&#39;s side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She approaches Tony, and utters the best line of the episode: &#34;Anthony, can you hear us?&#34; In Tony\&#39;s world, he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light. He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone. He tries to dial, but he cannot--as if he were trying to say something back to Carmella, but couldn\&#39;t physically bring himself to do so. Not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He sits down and looks out his window. A shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;When It\&#39;s Cold I\&#39;d Like To Die&#34; by Moby marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional roller-coaster of an episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Watch the next episode. You find out what the light is. It\&#39;s wonderful.&#39;,
   &#39;Wasn\&#39;t quite sure what to expect with this one, outside of the uniform positive reviews I\&#39;ve read. Turns out, I could have never imagined this movie, because it\&#39;s very close to &#34;The Bride with White Hair&#34; in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic. This walks a fine line between being a farce, a comedy, and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling. There\&#39;s nothing scary about it, that\&#39;s not the theme, it\&#39;s really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost, who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost. This also takes place in ancient China, with wild outlandish Kung Fu exhibitions, and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are top rate all the way. I could watch this genre of Chinese movies all day, because they are highly entertaining, great visuals, and pretty much tongue-in-cheek. And I\&#39;m looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also. Highly recommended.&#39;,
   &#39;Seriously, can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O\&#39;Conor AND Fiona Shaw? There\&#39;s no doubting that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards: but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen O\&#39;Conor (as Young Christie) and McAnally awarded: the cliché is true here: they don\&#39;t perform the roles, they inhabit them. Day-Lewis\&#39; performance is a tour de force - such a transformation that it is awe-inducing, but it was truly a mark of the Academy\&#39;s intelligence that alongside this performance, they also honoured Brenda Fricker\&#39;s beautifully restrained, still and heart-wrenching work as Christie\&#39;s mother. By the way, if you haven\&#39;t seen this magnificent actress in &#34;Swann&#34;, that\&#39;s another film well worth checking out for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).&#39;,
   &#39;I saw this when it premiered and just re-watched it on IFC again. This is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to Hawai\&#39;i to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900\&#39;s. My grandparents were part of that migration; my parents were born on a Kohala plantation (Big Island) at the time setting of the movie. I moved to the Big Island over a year ago after living in California for over 30 years. I was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped, with wild cane still growing, years after the plantations closed. I\&#39;ve heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation. This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories. This story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot-driven movie. It leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman\&#39;s. Some people just don\&#39;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn\&#39;t recall that Youki Kudoh had the starring role, with which she did an incredible job. I recall her great performances in Jim Jarmusch\&#39;s &#34;Mystery Train&#34; and in an Australian film, co- starring with Russell Crowe, &#34;Heaven\&#39;s Burning&#34;. Tamlyn Tomita did a great job with her pidgin English, especially for someone who didn\&#39;t grow up in the Islands. I had forgotten that Toshiro Mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator. And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had an uncredited, non-speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was saddened to find out that the director and co-writer, Kayo Hatta, died in an accidental drowning in 2005. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience: &#34;Gaijin&#34; about the immigrant cane workers in Brazil (many of them Japanese) in the same time period; and &#34;Sugar Cane Alley&#34; about the cane plantation experience in Africa. The latter is still available, but &#34;Gaijin&#34;, sadly, doesn\&#39;t appear to have been shown in quite a while. Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is &#34;A Thousand Pieces of Gold&#34;. This was set over the Chinese workers\&#39; involvement in the building of the railroad, starred Rosalind Chao, Chris Cooper, Michael Paul Chan, and Dennis Dun.&#39;,
   &#39;I saw this film on television years ago, but here several years after, I wake up in the morning, and still remember her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is the most profoundly terrifying film I have seen.&#39;,
   &#34;The humor implicit in the complete title proverb derives from the Sunday School dictum that one would be better advised to prepare before you&#39;re dead for the Devil&#39;s scrutiny, i.e. so the Devil doesn&#39;t care when you&#39;re dead. There&#39;s no percentage in trying to Beat the Devil. The characters apparently didn&#39;t pay attention at Sunday School, and find themselves forced into crisis management, having eschewed crisis avoidance. But even a seasoned CEO would have difficulty managing these crises. Throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable Sidney Lumet films. Until now, Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other Lumet All Stars like Steiger and Pacino.&#34;,
   &#39;When I started watching &#34;Fay Grim&#34;, I had no idea that it was a sequel to &#34;Henry Fool&#34;. Now, the latter was not a movie that I envisioned as having a sequel. But one has arrived, and it\&#39;s quite good. I assume that you\&#39;ve seen the original, so I won\&#39;t explain it. This one starts with Fay (Parker Posey) living with her son whom she had with deadbeat Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in jail. One day, the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. But this is no ordinary toy. It holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie. And this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than &#34;Syriana&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I\&#39;m quite impressed with what Hal Hartley has accomplished here. Maybe this one doesn\&#39;t quite reach the original\&#39;s quality, but it certainly takes a good look at what\&#39;s going on in the world. And the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also starring Jeff Goldblum.&#39;,
   &#34;I missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on ABC website during the summer of 2007. I am absolutely crazy about the show. I think the entire cast is excellent. It&#39;s one of my favorite show ever. I just checked the ABC program lineup for this Fall and did not see it on the schedule. That is really sad. I hope they will bring it back ... maybe they are waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it only my wishful thinking? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks, similar to mine. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up.&#34;,
   &#39;I only saw it once. This happened in 1952, I was seven, the movie 13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were so young... But I kept in mind, forever, the strong moments of Gunga\&#39;s sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation. Under these historical circumstances, in the movie, the personal relation of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores itself, the one raised between people who share daily life, who see each other faces, who knows each other names, but belong to different worlds, can only make appears. Then, in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges: &#34;Whom are we, in first, supposed to be loyal?&#34;, which People, family, motherland, the person you know close to you?. You do not have time to give a perfect answer, urgency is there, and it is for life or death. Gunga-Din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself. Somewhere, in a confuse manner, a problem remains unsolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today, because this death, this unique vanishing life I lived it, I shared with my child unconditional friendship. It was lived by the spectator I was. That day I loose Gunga-Din for ever. As I left behind, later, my pretty childhood, as I left from then so many worlds I lived in. I left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit I didn\&#39;t expect to do this morning when getting up.&#39;,
   &#34;Once in the Life means that once a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and nobody gets in or out of `The Life&#39; for free. Neighborhood hoodlums in New York sell drugs and run scams because they can&#39;t make it in the legitimate world, maybe because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or because they&#39;re just lazy. This simple story with a couple of twists about mostly despicable characters manages to draw compassion out of the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other. The film is written, produced, and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also stars as 20/20 Mike (all hoodlums have nicknames), and is based on his play, `Riff Raff.&#39; It feels like a play from beginning to end, especially during the longest scene where the three main players square off to decide who can be trusted. Often times the dialog comes very fast, much faster than it would on stage, and I think it&#39;s the film&#39;s biggest flaw. Mixed in as flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street, a sort of iambic pentameter rap, that is violent and evocative of the world this movie discloses. The poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men, these hoodlums who murder, cheat, and betray each other, as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt. The disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all. One is too stupid, another a junkie, and the last suffers from conscience while the audience wonders, or even laughs, at the irony of executioners demanding from him hanging in the gallows to tell jokes in the midst of his demise.&#34;,
   &#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw once No Man&#39;s Land (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found it ok. The film is about a guy who steals only Porsches. Gone in Sixty Seconds comes 13 years after and adds nothing to it. In fact, it has a lot of scenes that are worthless. And the ending is very, very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used...&#34;,
   &#39;Cheech &amp; Chong\&#39;s Next Movie (1980) was the second film to star to pot loving duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. The lovable burn out smokers are now roommates. They live in a condemned building looking for ways to score more smoke and just lay about all day. But Cheech is the &#34;responsible&#34; one. He has a job and a steady girlfriend. One day, Cheech wants to get his freak on so he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem arises as well, Cheech\&#39;s brother &#34;Red&#34; (Cheech is another role) is in town and wants to hang with him. Firguring that he could kill two birds with one stone, Cheech pawns Chong off and Red. What kind of adventures will Chong and Red get into? Will Cheech get his freak on? How long will Chong go without some smoke? Just watch CHEECH &amp; CHONG\&#39;S NEXT MOVIE to find out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tommy Chong takes over the directorial reigns for the sequel. He received some experience when he did some uncredited work on UP IN SMOKE. Funny but not as good as the first film. But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&#39;,
   &#39;Without &#34;mental anachronism&#34;, this film which I would like to find in DVD offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the &#34;disenchantment of the world&#34;. That, there is thirty years, a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding. It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included/understood, analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of &#34;primitive thought&#34;. Because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior, that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance. If somebody knows where I then to get a numerical copy or VHS to me or DVD\x85 thank you in advance.&#39;,
   &#39;In &#34;Anne of Green Gables&#34; (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (O.P. Heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris-a veteran of Disney\&#39;s series of &#34;Alice&#34; shorts who later would adopt her character\&#39;s name). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery\&#39;s source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story. The movie suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of Anne\&#39;s reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old that from a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles, and her long red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact Anne is the original &#34;Teenage Drama Queen&#34; and the film\&#39;s screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy. A change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the Montgomery\&#39;s story I can see no reason to take issue with the changes, but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation. The comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parodies of Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood\&#39;s all- time beauties and the film is in black and white. So much of the amusement is in seeing the title character\&#39;s endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen. Anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: &#34;If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me&#34;. Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Brown does a nice job as Anne\&#39;s love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the Cuthbert\&#39;s pompous neighbor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, what do I know? I\&#39;m only a child.&#39;,
   &#39;I approach films about talking animals with care. For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats &amp; Dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn\&#39;t exactly fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day, he hears singing coming from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out. Misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. And not a few phrases either. Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha. Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story. Which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stutter. The two of them became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Marie\&#39;s parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars. Of a cage that is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. And although it wasn\&#39;t afforded the same recognition or box-office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Mohr\&#39;s stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie. He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck. Paulie\&#39;s worldly, but he is also naive in his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because he\&#39;s lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he\&#39;s taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie, which he believes. Only for those promises to be broken time and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paulie is admittedly a little episodic. It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie. He first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. She sympathises with Paulie\&#39;s situation, and drives an RV across America to find Marie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paulie is an occasionally very touching film. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;There are things in life you put off, because you think you\&#39;re gonna do them later. But the real thing Ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment. And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film\&#39;s over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had. Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie even gets to have a romance. Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by Mohr as well). That may be the only complaint I have. As soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves Paulie on to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny, but a little disturbing too. I\&#39;m amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film. And Paulie\&#39;s diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible. He\&#39;s caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he\&#39;s remained ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story finally comes full circle at the lab, where Misha vows to help Paulie. Of course they do find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was left numb for several minutes. Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has, but I believe its an equally brilliant film. The same laughs. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor gem.&#39;,
   &#34;Rather nasty piece of business featuring Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes, a Renfield-like assistant and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist&#39;s wife (sounds like a Greenaway movie actually lol). Lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides (why them? Who knows?) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. He gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar. After another bride bites the dust, a newspaper reporter just HAPPENS to be around for the scoop, and decides to snoop around for a story. She gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and Lugosi. Heaven knows where the police were. Soon she&#39;s off to Bela&#39;s lair, when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil. It all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist, but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision, as he foils her plans, Oh no! What will happen? I actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here, his hangers-on are all very very strange, the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable. A fun little view.&#34;,
   &#39;Powers Booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his Peoples Temple followers from 1953 until 1978 when he led them in a mass suicide in 1978 where over 900 died. A very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the time 8 of 10&#39;,
   &#39;I have recently seen this production on DVD. It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as I remembered. At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then. (I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then) But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been. I am a bit of a &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one. I have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on. Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way, some even leave out the &#34;Rivers&#34; family and their connection to Jane altogether. I also think this is the only production to include the &#34;Gypsy&#34; scene done correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casting is perfect, Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book &#34;small plain and dark&#34; and I disagree that she looked too old. Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester, portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time, like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted, his expression is fantastically frightening. But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another. A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable. Oh to be loved by a man like that! There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however, like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things (I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection!&#39;,
   &#39;I second the motion to make this into a movie, it would be great!! I was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game. I have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time. Final Fantasy eat your heart out!! THIS SHOULD BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!!!!! If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie, please contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The graphics are great for PS1 and even make you forget it is PS1 most of the time. The multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a taut suspenseful masterpiece from Brian De Palmawith amazing performances all around!. It&#39;s extremely suspenseful, and often scary, and the score is fantastic, plus all the characters were awesome. Yes it rips off Psycho a lot, however it&#39;s still a brilliantly made horror/thriller, with a fantastic opening and a shocking and unpredictable finale!. This is unquestionably one of the best horror/thrillers i have ever seen, and the elevator scene is one of the most memorable scenes ever, plus Michael Caine is simply amazing in this!. The ending is excellent, and the hospital scene near the end is absolutely terrifying, plus the end twist shocked the hell out of me!. It never failed to creep me out, and the stalk sequences are absolutely brilliant, plus Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon had fantastic chemistry together!. This is a taut suspenseful masterpiece from Brian De Palma, with amazing performances all around!. The Direction is Incredible!. Brian De Palma does an incredible job here, with Amazing camera work, incredible angles, fantastic use of colors, awesome zoom in&#39;s and zoom out&#39;s great POV shots and keeping the film at a very very fast pace!. There is a bit of blood. We get bloody stabbings, knifing&#39;s, bloody gunshot wounds,and 2 bloody slit throats.The Acting is amazing!. Michael Caine is AMAZING here, he is amazing in the acting department, creepy, is very likable, was mysterious, and really just did an amazing job overall i Loved him! (Caine Rules!). Angie Dickinson gives a memorable performance here, and was quite beautiful, and had good chemistry with Caine. Nancy Allen is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!, and is fantastic here, she is extremely likable as the hooker, had excellent chemistry with Keith Gordon, and put on a tremendous show!. Keith Gordon is very good as the kid, he had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen, and was very likable!. Dennis Franz is good as the detective. Overall this is unquestionably one of the best horror films ever made, and i say drop what your doing immediately and go see it!. ***** out of 5&#34;,
   &#39;This is actually a groovy-neat little flick, made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness . It takes a little while to warm up to it. The acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen-like charm. After a few scenes, you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries. The characters all develop a quirky charm, especially &#34;Richard&#34;. Forget Anthony Hopkins, Maidens is the guy I\&#39;d hire to play a raving psychopath. He just seems to enjoy it so very much! Mixed in with the scenes of mad-slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character, &#34;The Midnight Skater&#34; zooming through the campus in a black hoodie, looking for all the world like a cross between the Grim Reaper and, say, The Silver Surfer. These shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the Skater seem almost ominous. The soundtrack features some very fun Garage-Punk tunes and the raspy, raucous meanness of it meshes well with the film\&#39;s mood. Thumbs upish, I say.&#39;,
   &#39;When it came out, this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment. To this day it\&#39;s more entertaining than most, in great part because it has James Cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty &#34;girl Friday&#34; played by Joan Blondell. Also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by Busby Berkeley are pretty much a knock-out as far as that type of thing goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a pretty strange movie. I mean in one of those numbers, you\&#39;ve got Billy Barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler, doing all kinds of weird stuff. Ruby Keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times, but at least she\&#39;s not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films. You\&#39;d never guess that Dick Powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie; apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star Cagney. As for Cagney, his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time. After a while it gets a bit too much. You expect him to walk out and say, &#34;Hey! I\&#39;ve got a great idea for a prologue! The women are cigarettes, and they come out of a pack of smokes! Oh no, we did that one last month!&#34; It\&#39;s funny but it gets a bit repetitive. In the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl, Ruth Donnelly, some of the established Cagney gangster character comes out. In fact frequent B gangster director William Keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching, and it seems at times that Cagney and Blondell are invoking something very &#34;street&#34; even though the characters aren\&#39;t criminal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The musical numbers... what can you say? They stand alone as entertainment, the way that Berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling. But none of them really mean anything. It means &#34;Honeymoon Hotel&#34;, nothing really more or less. And the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately, since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn\&#39;t possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays. For example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper, things like that. The whole thing could only exist on film, so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous. I can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so, because this is a very polished production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s great to see Cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills, and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like Keeler. Cagney and Blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well. The music I would say is only mediocre, but mostly pleasing if repetitive. Bacon\&#39;s direction in general is very suitable but never interesting. The film\&#39;s entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way. It\&#39;s a cut above most &#34;let\&#39;s put on a show&#34; films of the 30s.&#39;,
   &#34;Ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from? According to &#39;Jake Speed&#39; they are based on real people, living out the adventures they write about and publish. This movie is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence, and skimpy clothes at the worst. The language is is also not a problem, and the jokes are funny at all levels. This is a &#39;Austin Powers&#39; look at &#39;Indian Jones&#39;, without the over-the-top antics of Michael Myers. I highly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range.&#34;,
   &#39;The first thing I thought after watching &#34;Mystery Men&#34; was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and funny that it\&#39;s status as a bomb defies logic. Well, I hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit, and you can count me amoung it\&#39;s fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, and without giving too much away, this movie does for comic books what &#34;the Princess Bride&#34; did for fairy tales and &#34;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?&#34; did for classic cartoons. That should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to (this is one of those cases like &#34;the Iron Giant&#34; where the studio had no clue what it had on it\&#39;s hands). Rent it the next time you\&#39;re in the mood for something a little offbeat. You won\&#39;t listen to the BeeGees in the same light ever again.&#39;,
   &#39;I picked up the movie with no cover and not even knowing what it was, but when I watched it I laughed so hard. It is now one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the guys created a masterpiece I would highly recommend this movie to any one with a sense of humor. Thank You Rusty for giving us something to laugh at.&#39;,
   &#39;After Garbo\&#39;s introduction to sound in Clarence Brown\&#39;s &#34;Anna Christie&#34;, Jacques Feyder made a German version of the movie where all of the cast, except for Garbo, were different. While the American version is still more available in the USA and most of the American viewers have primarily seen this version, the Germna &#34;Anna Christie&#34; is more likely to be viewed in Europe. As I have seen both films, I feel the right to compare the two closely-knit productions. Is Jacques Feyder\&#39;s film different? Is it better than Clarence Brown\&#39;s? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this analysis, I would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common. They have identical sets, very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes. Here, you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life. Here, you also have the humorous, though a bit shorter, sequence in the amusement park. However, when emphasizing Garbo herself, I address the first difference. She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking. The viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks, which occurred, most probably, to 1931 viewers. Garbo was very good in American film and she is also very good here. Yet, to me, she seems even more genuine in the German version. It is noticeable that Garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much (the effort that was artificially created by the sensation: GARBO TALKS!). Her German is not very well pronounced; yet no one cares: everything is perfectly understood. Therefore, I can easily say the same I did in my American version comment: Skaal Greta Garbo! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, the film differs in one very important issue: the rest of the cast. Here comes the question: which portrayal seems more captivating, which one is better for sure? The differences are filled with varieties. Salka Viertel (or Salka Steuerman), Garbo\&#39;s lifelong friend, does not do the equally great job as Marie Dressler in the role of Marthy Owens. She is not bad, she is different, sometimes overacts (from today\&#39;s perspective) but is no longer that genuine in the role as Marie Dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time. Some people even claim that Dressler was better than Garbo in the film and that opinion, though appears to be questionable of course, carries some truth. Theo Shall is more sympathetic as Matt than Charles Bickford but when applied to him, this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who shines in the German &#34;Anna Christie&#34;, who is really worth greatest attention is Hans Junkermann in the role of Chris Christopherson, Anna\&#39;s father. George F. Marion vs Hans Junkermann is like a day vs night difference. Junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict, a man with hopes, with fears, who overdoes the care of his daughter. The scene of Anna\&#39;s first meeting with her father is truly magnificent, the opening moment of Chris\&#39; conversation with Marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance. Junkermann is the Chris whom you like, who you sometimes laugh at, whom you sympathize with, who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind. Great! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have seen the American &#34;Anna Christie&#34; and have a chance to get the German version, I would highly recommend to you this movie because it\&#39;s a slightly different look at the story, a nice and accurate way to compare, a fine enrichment to Clarence Brown\&#39;s movie and, foremost, a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance: Hans Junkermann\&#39;s. Skaal or Prost, Hans Junkermann!&#39;,
   &#39;I watched this movie alongwith my complete family of Nine. Since my younger brother has recently got married, we could connect with the goings-on. The movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple. Thankfully this time all Indian locales like Ranikhet Almora etc have been used, which have been already visited by most of the urbanites, hence adding to the connection with movie. The dialogues are much better than those in the &#34;Umrao Jaan Ada&#34; - a supposedly dialogue based movie. The background music is augmenting the &#34;soft focus&#34; of the movie. It somehow remind me of VV Chopra\&#39;s &#34;Kareeb&#34;, in which neha and to some extent Bobby did full justice to the character. Same here, in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting. The Supporting cast are too good. I rate the actress playing the role of Bhabhi in the front league. The situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters. Songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie. However, though I respect Ravindra Jain for his body of work from movies to Ramayana, I missed Ram Laxman badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had no double entendres(Sivan category), no bikinis, no intrigue, and no nonsense. You would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you\&#39;re already or going to be soon engaged. I want to express on candid thing here that though Suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals, his approach is totally individualistic. The movie is only about Prem &amp; Poonam, rest of the characters are incidental. Art immitating life? The &#34;peripheral characters&#34; are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming back, Everything was almost great. Except, for the drama part. The situation of tragedy was artificially created. The outcome, the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all. That is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events. But, a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a \&#39;feature film\&#39;. But I kept waiting for the punch and it never came. The preaching by Mohnish Bahal and later by Alok Nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard. May be this will help the movie a tax-free status. But the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 Has the movie really ended? 2 Has the movie ended?&#39;,
   &#39;If in the 90\&#39;s you\&#39;re adapting a book written in the 50\&#39;s, set the bloody thing in the 50\&#39;s and not the \&#39;90\&#39;s. See, 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well, or ring as true, that far down the road. It\&#39;s a simple rule that Hollywood habitually keeps violating. And that\&#39;s the problem with this film. It should have been set in the era it was written in. You\&#39;d think that would be a no-brainer, but nooo. I\&#39;d elaborate, but bmacv\&#39;s comment spells it out quite well. I\&#39;ll limit my commentary to Rachel Ward. She looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role. As a result, she looks like a crack ho\&#39; on chemotherapy, and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag. I found her &#34;I could die at any moment&#34; look quite disconcerting, and it greatly detracted from her supposed &#34;hotness&#34; and the &#34;sexual tension&#34; the film intended to create. Other than that, the film was quite good; a 7+ out of 10.&#39;,
   &#34;Rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity. Reichdeutch women find that their Jewish Husbands have been locked up pending deportation. One an aristocrat disowned by her family, Lena Fischer, finds herself among the mob as does General Gudarian&#39;s sister. But rank and privilege merit no special consideration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor does service to the Reich as a female detainee whose husband is on the Ostfront will learn. In one of the most horrifying scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lest you think this is typical German brutishness we in America today have Lady Bush imperiously ordering the arrest of Gold Star Mothers (mothers of US service-members killed in action) because their very presence is offencive. Little, regrettably, has changed in the 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately the eight year old daughter Ruth escapes capture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting in the cold on Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer is at first reluctant to take in Ruth responding in a way that we take as typically German. Even Lena Fisher&#39;s brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach who is aware of and opposed to the Holocost cautions Lena against it. but Lena chooses to embrace the idea with an American rebelliousness even renaming Ruth, the more aryan sounding name Helga Lehmann.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The siege ends favourably on Rosenstrasse but Lena mourns: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later Ruth&#39;s daughter Hannah sets out in search of her mother&#39;s past and meets 90 year old Lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did deem it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the Ostfront.&#34;,
   &#34;If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England. Other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens in the major roles. Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter&#39;s eye. Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us.&#34;,
   &#39;I would not hesitate to put this adaptation of \&#39;Death Trap&#34; in a top 5 list of the best stage-to-movie adaptations ever. Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and &#34;Superman&#34;) play off each other extremely well here. Even Dyan Cannon - who I normally don\&#39;t care for - is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m not sure that comparisons of &#34;Deathtrap&#34; with &#34;Sleuth&#34; - another brilliant stage-to-screen adaptation featuring Michael Caine - are valid, or even fair. Yes, the two stories have a lot in common. But &#34;Sleuth&#34; is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits, and the house in &#34;Sleuth&#34; is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors - the house doesn\&#39;t really have an equivalent in &#34;Deathtrap&#34;. And &#34;Deathtrap&#34; isn\&#39;t so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed vignette about how people are no damned good (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. I\&#39;ll just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre, and well worth your time and money. This is America, after all. You don\&#39;t have to choose! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won\&#39;t give away the twists and turns of the plot, but I don\&#39;t think it matters anyway. I\&#39;ve watched the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years, and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean, scary moments when things go &#34;all pear shaped&#34;. It\&#39;s all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who likes black-hearted comedy and suspense in the Hitchcock style of film-making will probably enjoy &#34;Deathtrap&#34; immensely.&#39;,
   &#34;I wasn&#39;t sure at first if I was watching a documentary, propaganda film or dramatic presentation. I guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on. We were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this movie came together for me was closer to the end. The scenes had a realism (at least as I perceived it) that I haven&#39;t encountered often before. You could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants. This was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real Japanese actors would be somewhat scarce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is excellent as a source of the state of the American mindset in 1943 as the war waged with Japan. Also of interest was a dig at the Japanese with respect to the help the USA gave Japan in past years.&#34;,
   &#39;At first this looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got into it it turned out to be a really funny film. Basically forgetful ex-comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winning, and Golden Glove nominated George Burns) were a great comedy duo, and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a TV show. Willy\&#39;s nephew, Ben Clark (Golden Globe winning Richard Benjamin) is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other, how wrong he is. They cannot get on all the time, they are both forgetful, especially during conversation, but they do it eventually. Also starring Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al\&#39;s Daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy\&#39;s nurse and Muppets from Space\&#39;s F. Murray Abraham as Mechanic. I think the best line of the film is Burns mentioning that Matthau called him &#34;a son of a bitch bastard&#34;. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!&#39;,
   &#34;Another reason to watch this delightful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance. As they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. From 1939, its a different time but therein lies the charm. It transports you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely delightful, at the same time strong, vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman.Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I am going to seek out the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of the Flynn/Gable mode and proves a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some excellent comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30&#39;s/40&#39;s movies, Don&#39;t miss this one!&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is just a lot of fun. I\&#39;ve seen it a couple of times, but it always has something funny that I remember. The &#34;duckies and bunnies&#34; car scene is one of my favorites, and I still quote Morone\&#39;s versions of certain words!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many running jokes, that it\&#39;s amazing. But I love Michael Keaton anyhow!&#39;,
   &#39;Show favorites Green Arrow (introduced this season), Aquaman (introduced in Season 5), &#34;Impulse&#34; (Season 4), and Cyborg (Season 5) all come together, along with Clark, to stop one of Lex\&#39;s evil plans in this thrilling mid-season episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through his sophisticated technology, Green Arrow learns that Lex Luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on. Green Arrow over the past months has allied Arthur Curry (Aqua), Bart Allen (Impulse) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to stop Lex and destroy these facilities. After recruiting Clark to help, the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This episode is incredible. Full of action, humor, and fabulous dialog, it feels more like a movie. It is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season.&#39;,

   &#39;MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is a mesmerizing 1945 B thriller from Joseph H. Lewis, arguably one of the very finest directors of Hollywood noir films. This 65 minute Gothic oddity from Columbia Pictures came after Lewis\&#39; lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns, East Side Kids comedies, horror melodramas (including the incredibly bizarre Bela Lugosi shocker THE INVISIBLE GHOST) and standard studio B product (SECRETS OF A CO-ED, BOMBS OVER BURMA, THE FALCON IN SAN FRANCISCO, etc)---all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive Mr. Lewis. MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS (as well as SO DARK THE NIGHT from the following year) introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets. Later Lewis productions like GUN CRAZY (1949) and THE BIG COMBO (1955), despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure, continued to rely upon deft, lucid camera work and effective low-key lighting. And very modest resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS probably owes more to the tradition of British mysteries (it\&#39;s set in a studio-bound England) than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings. A young woman (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman (Dame Mae Witty). Two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and, mysteriously enough, with a brand new identity---that of the old woman\&#39;s daughter-in-law. Told that she\&#39;s been the victim of a nervous breakdown, she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament. But before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery, that her &#34;husband&#34; (the always menacing George Macready) most probably murdered his real wife and that she\&#39;s been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme. Much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that Lewis brings to the production, marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director.&#39;,
   &#34;This musical is decidedly mixed, and none of the elements really fit together, but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable. The plot contains some of the elements of Wodehouse&#39;s novel, but none of its virtues, though he co-wrote the script. The songs, though charming, have nothing to do with this particular film, and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot, even by pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen do their usual shtick quite competently, but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty IQ points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few high points. Reginald Gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie, and stops mugging like a silent actor. And there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by Wodehouse, though most of the film feels like the production of one of the Hollywood meetings he later parodied.&#34;,
   &#34;The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. Alexander Korda nearly went broke making this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the Citadel Film series Book about The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. But World War II unfortunately caught up with Korda and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Budget costs happen in US films too, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand at Paramount after 1932 when he returned there. But DeMille nor any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the film. Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon. He certainly wasn&#39;t going to get scenery like that in the UK. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spectacle of the thing earned The Thief Of Bagdad four Academy Award nominations and three Oscars for best color cinematography, best art&amp;set direction for a color film, and best special effects. Only Miklos Rosza&#39;s original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. Korda must have been real happy about deciding to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it&#39;s impossible to get bad color pictures from that place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects however do not overwhelm the simple story of good triumphing over evil. The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer who tries to steal both a kingdom and a heart, both belonging to Duprez. This was Veidt&#39;s career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source. Beggar boy and thief Sabu who may very well have been one of the few who could call himself at the time an international movie star. Literally rising from poverty working as an elephant stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore he was spotted by Alexander Korda who needed a native lead for one of his jungle features. Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who topples a tyrant. Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today. It&#39;s an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it.&#34;,
   &#34;It&#39;s all about Mitzi. I loved her in this. And didn&#39;t she look fantastic?! I love these Lifetime Sunday afternoon popcorn movies. This is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times. The Richard character was completely creepy. I&#39;ve dated guys like that. Well, not totally like that lol. I wish Zack hadn&#39;t have gotten killed. He was a cutie and very easy on the eyes. I LOVE these stalker type stories. It always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked. My husband doesn&#39;t usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it. I can&#39;t wait to see what Mitzi does next!&#34;,
   &#34;I wait for each new episode, each re-run with anticipation! The new look of sci-fi created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder that I hope will never end. To combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me. Season #9 should be a thrill in itself. I wish that Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season, as I love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as Jack O&#39;Neill. The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. You cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake. Also, you need a bigger role for the Asgard - they are just too cool.&#34;,
   &#34;Very smart, sometimes shocking, I just love it. It shoved one more side of David&#39;s brilliant talent. He impressed me greatly! David is the best. The movie captivates your attention for every second.&#34;,
   &#34;Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it&#39;s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.&#34;,
   &#34;1936 was the most prolific year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second film for RKO that year is the third film in this collection \x96 Mark Sandrich&#39;s &#39;Follow The Fleet.&#39; This time out Astaire is painfully uncomfortable as Bake Baker, a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront café where Sherry Martin (Rogers) is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyone&#39;s ear. Yep, you guessed it \x96 they&#39;re hot for each other once again. Only this time Sherry&#39;s spinster sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the whole fine romance by falling for Bake&#39;s robust seafaring buddy, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a sort of use &#39;em up and toss &#39;em out kind of guy, thus forcing Sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general. Irving Berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic, classy score, including standards &#39;Let Yourself Go&#39;, &#39;I&#39;m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket&#39; and &#39;Let&#39;s Face the Music and Dance;&#39; the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for Fred and Ginger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transfer on &#39;Follow The Fleet&#39; is a tad weaker. The gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it&#39;s a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles. Grain is still present. So are age related artifacts. Once you&#39;ve settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage. The audio is Mono but very nicely balanced. Extras include a featurette, theatrical trailer and short subject, but oddly \x96 no audio commentary. Considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of Astaire/Rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from Warner Home Video.&#34;,
   &#34;Rated NR(would be Rated R for Pervasive Strong Language and Crude Sexual Humor). Quebec Rating:16+(should be 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating:18A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie&#39;s first stand up comedy routine.This came out in 1983.Back then he starred in the movie 48 hrs and Trading Places and he was on Saturday Night Live.Eddie made two stand up comedy films.Delirious and Raw.I preferred Raw because I just found the subject matter to be more humorous.Delirious however is also very funny with Eddie talking about his childhood and making fun of celebrities such as Mr.T and singers such as Michael Jackson.Any fan of stand-up comedy films should see Eddie Murphy&#39;s Delirious.&#34;,
   &#34;He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in `Glory&#39;, he proved he was no `Malcolm in the Middle&#39; mediocre actor in `Malcolm X&#39;, he showed his brotherly love for acting in `Philadelphia&#39;, he pulled a slam dunk in `He Got Game&#39;, he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in `The Hurricane&#39;, he provided us effective thespian education in `Training Day&#39;, and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct! Denzel Washington&#39;s directorial debut `Antwone Fisher&#39; is the most moving film of the year. This tearjerker `fish&#39;er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher&#39; possesses an emotional joyous conclusion. The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke&#39;s debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke&#39;s acting as I have seen in Washington&#39;s past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am your acting father&#39;. Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the acting `Master D&#39; himself. `Antwone Fisher&#39; was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife&#39;s screenplay was of `fisher king&#39; material. I hail to the chief `Mr. Washington&#39; in catching the right bait in `Antwone Fisher&#39;. ***** Excellent&#34;,
   &#34;Simply one of the best ever! Richard Brooks&#39; adaptation of Truman Capote&#39;s non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Stunning black and white cinematography (that should have won an Oscar), a haunting Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the oddly-matched killers. This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and wasn&#39;t even nominated for Best Picture while Dr. Doolittle was. Go Figure! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you don&#39;t get to know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There are simply no flaws in this one. 10 out of 10. Best performance = Scott Wilson with R. Blake a close second. Highly recommended!&#34;,
   &#34;Finally we have before us a Category III movie for the summer 2006 season. Made of equal parts cruelty, crime and passion, Dog Bite Dog benefits not merely from an apt title, but also flexible direction, superb cinematography and respectable performances from most involved. Of course there has to be a catch, manifested here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies, yet all told DBD represents the mature spirit we&#39;d love to see more of in the HK mainstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also marks the heralded return of Edison Chen, long absent since the Initial D debacle of a year ago. Chen&#39;s reserved machismo does wonders for the movie, yet would have had it rough without opposite Sam Lee, whose knack for alternating between physical comedy (Crazy &#39;N&#39; the City, No Problem 2) and lunatic menace has culminated in the strongest role we&#39;ve seen from him since Made in Hong Kong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, the duo makes Dog Bite Dog, and hopefully Edison&#39;s going to get an easier break from now on as a consequence: his touch transformed projects from Princess D to the Infernal Affairs saga, and still he remains a rare occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly upon commencing, DBD showcases some mesmerizing imagery, playing gorgeous tricks with light, shadow and perspective. The soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect, adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys. Much of the resultant combination probably has to do with writer Matt Chow, previously engaged in likewise gruesome Three Extremes. Dog Bite Dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project, namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest assured, though, this isn&#39;t a horror movie, instead following a path trodden before by classic One Nite in Mongkok, albeit from a miles more perverse angle. Replacing Daniel Wu&#39;s reluctant mainland assassin character we have Edison, playing a nameless killing machine hailing from Cambodia&#39;s underworld. Sent Hong Kong-way to execute a single target, the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival, a process chillingly depicted courtesy of the film&#39;s brilliant visuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer, Edison&#39;s eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail, picked up on by a CID team sent to investigate. This assembly features a nice cameo by mob-movie stalwart Lam Suet, and good support from TV star Wayne Lai. However, Sam Lee&#39;s renegade officer Wai leads the charge, revealing himself to be a highly disturbed individual but excellent cop nonetheless. We gradually learn Wai&#39;s inner-conflict stems from his father&#39;s police corruption background, evoking demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor body count transpires, as Edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no-no. There&#39;s quite the violence quotient in store, even though gore per se feels toned down in places, and adult language only makes a token appearance. Once more, no nudity, leading one to conclude Cat III&#39;s are being handed these days a bit hastily. Still, DBD&#39;s a relatively mature theatrical release, and we applaud its arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In between the fighting, stabbing , hacking and shooting, even a career murderer needs some romance, and just like Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite, so does intrepid Mr. Chen get a sweetheart, done beautifully by new comer Pei Pei. Her unnamed character (lots of anonymity in this one) meets Edison&#39;s at a strangely deserted landfill, abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape. When the killer ditches HK, he agrees to take her with him, and they go on the run together, love blooming en route. While the movie doesn&#39;t linger on lovey-dovey stuff, our hearts go out to Pei Pei&#39;s tragic character and her endless suffering. She renders the timid but valiant protagonist amazingly well, establishing that there aren&#39;t any good or bad guys here, evinced by the highly sobering finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Cheang Soi&#39;s portfolio includes recent suspense thriller Home Sweet Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, two numbers likely surpassed in most accounts by Dog Bite Dog&#39;s sinister demeanor. Cheang manages to keep DBD flowing throughout, and considering the many parts in play here, stands up to critical standards erected by people like Johnny To in his watershed nocturnal epic The Mission. A couple of glitches do come about, to wit Edison miraculously shrugging off a shot to the chest, but these are highly forgivable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marking triumphant returns for two young, talented performers of the kind Hong Kong needs if we want the city&#39;s movie heyday to come back, Dog Bite Dog doesn&#39;t stand out for story. Its forte lies in strong portrayals and style, buoyed along on the strength of thespian muscle and a keen eye for visual and auditory finesse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HK has a long, time-honored tradition of stories to do with the city&#39;s nighttime alter-ego, something Dog Bite Dog upholds lovingly, amounting to a solid run if not an outright masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: * * * *&#34;,
   &#39;I enjoyed Albert Pyun\&#39;s &#34;Nemesis&#34; for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. A lot of people complain about the &#34;confusing&#34; plot to the first film, which is probably why &#34;Nemesis 2: Nebula&#34; has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one gives the name of the first movie\&#39;s hero, Alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles, which I liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). It doesn\&#39;t take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). There are subplots involving Africa\&#39;s political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. The picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. The picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just don\&#39;t expect quality, or anything of the first movie.&#39;,
   &#39;It started out slow after an excellent animated intro, as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop. Once the bet is on, though, the movie picks up the pace as it\&#39;s a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm. We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son: bullies, helping others, mind over matter when you don\&#39;t want to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of special note is the girl who played Erica (Erk): Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly, and when she is on-screen she is captivating. She\&#39;s one of those &#34;Hey, she looks familiar&#34; faces, and then I remembered that she was the little girl that Pepsi featured about 8 years ago. She was also in &#34;Paulie&#34;, that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Eisenberg made many TV and movie appearances in \&#39;99-00, but then was not seen much for the next few years. She\&#39;s now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman. Her smile really warms up the screen. If she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career (or better?) than Haley Joel Osment, another three named kid actor, but hopefully without some of the problems that Osment has been in lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywhozitz, according to my 8 y.o. son, who just finished reading the story, the film did not seem to follow the book all that well, but was entertaining none the less. The ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels (How to Eat Boiled Slugs? Escargot Kid\&#39;s Style?), which might not be such a bad thing. It was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language, violence or sex scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other good aspect of the movie was the respect/fear engendered by the principal Mr. Burdock (Boilerplate). Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons. While he has one particular goofy scene, he ruled the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin getting some work.&#39;,
   &#34;Ah, I loved this movie. I think it had it all. It made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times. Yes, I am a girl, so I&#39;m writing this from a girl&#39;s perspective. I think it&#39;s a shame it only scored 5.2 in rating. Too many guys voting? It was far above other romantic comedies. Just because I&#39;m female I don&#39;t enjoy all chic flicks, on the contrary I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be. But like I said, this movie had it all, almost, in my opinion. Great script, good one-liners, fine acting. Although Eva Longoria Parker&#39;s character reminded very much of Gabrielle from Desperate Housewives, but so what? It was awesome. I will keep this film for rainy days, days when I feel low and need a few laughs.&#34;,
   &#39;At the time, &#34;My Left Foot&#34; was the little movie that could. It was hugely popular, and everyone applauded the fact that such a small, independent film could make it all the way to the Oscars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, movies like &#34;My Left Foot&#34; are a dime a dozen, so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about. It\&#39;s certainly a well made and competent film, but it\&#39;s clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis, who immerses himself in the role of Cristy Brown, a man living with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won Dustin Hoffman an Oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in &#34;Rain Man,&#34; and the Academy followed suit by giving Day-Lewis the same honor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing really separating this film from a big budget Hollywood production is just that -- its budget. In every other way it\&#39;s just as formulaic as any standard product. That\&#39;s not to say it isn\&#39;t a good movie, but it\&#39;s not a masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A-&#39;,
   &#39;This story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last Harem of the Ottoman empire, well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone, and learn about the people who lived there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the story, characters, acting and scenes. A few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character Safiya is played wonderfully by Marie Gillain who I am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less Hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating.&#39;,
   &#34;Yes, this is an ultra-low budget movie. So the acting isn&#39;t award winning material and at times the action is slow-paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie. This film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops a full plot out of it. Aside from the vampire story, we get detailed genetics info, legal and law enforcement, martial arts action, philosophical musings, and some good metal music. Kudos go to Dylan O&#39;Leary, the director/writer/main actor. It is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well. I think to appreciate this movie, you have to be well-versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things. There are some great camera work, too, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack- something I haven&#39;t seen before, but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in Fulci&#39;s Zombi. The casting is good, in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed. The main vampire also looks perfect for the role. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick, there should have been more nudity. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story, this flick is for you. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing future projects by Mr. O&#39;Leary.&#34;,
   &#39;This is a great movie if viewed in the proper context - It was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies (and the \&#39;80s saw plenty of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out, and instantly liked it. Being a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a metal-hating preacher can\&#39;t be all bad! Also, Fastway was already a favorite of mine, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original VHS (this was pre-DVD) cover for Trick Or Treat featured an illustration of Sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a &#34;demon&#34; looking on. It was a special order, and the price for the VHS copy at the time (circa 1987) was $90! I really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous price. The \&#39;OZZY-Gene\&#39; cover was only created for the $5 re-release. The company releasing it probably figured Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie, so they had better put \&#39;em on the cover! Same thing with the original &#34;Little Shop Of Horrors&#34; - Jack Nicholson was in it for all of five minutes, but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a &#34;Trick Or Treat&#34; web site, and it\&#39;s surprising how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to \&#39;Sammi Curr\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, it was just a good time, rock-n-roll movie. Definitely not to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed!&#39;,
   &#34;Bogmeister and others have pretty much nailed this. Shore Leave is really TOS&#39; first attempt at lightweight sci-fi (which they would later perfect with the classic Trouble with Tribbles). It gave both the crew of the Enterprise and its TV viewers a needed respite from the universe threatening consequences of, for example, The Corbomite Manouever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a place to chill out for a while, the Enterprise happens across a seemingly idyllic M Class planet, and sends an exploratory team down to take a closer look. Soon enough all kinds of absurdities begin to take place - some seemingly perilous - but it all seems a morass of human emotional extremities played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery (McCoy has gone through the looking glass), psychological thriller (Kirk is stalked by an indefatigable bully from his past), and romantic comedy (no comment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOS was the least serialized of all of the series in the Trek franchise, so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy-handed, potentially calamitous drama. Unlike later series franchise writers, TOS&#39; production team was not afraid to literally go where no TV series had gone before. And Shore Leave, despite its occasional problems, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (particularly Shatner - ironic given his legendary sense of humor) didn&#39;t seem to know how to handle this new wrinkle on ST&#39;s themes. The last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes I can remember from the entire TOS run - both compositionally and in terms of acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;nuff said. My recommendation - see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen - it order.&#34;,
   &#39;I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the most I\&#39;d laughed at one of Woody\&#39;s comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I\&#39;ve never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her &#34;sexy&#34; image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than &#34;Devil Wears Prada&#34; and more interesting than &#34;Superman&#34; a great comedy to go see with friends.&#39;,
   &#34;Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed up &#39;The Baron&#39; with this, a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted &#39;The Six Million Dollar Man&#39;. It was a favourite of mine when I was a youngster, and I enjoy watching it still. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable on-screen chemistry as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the luscious Alexandra Bastedo pouted her way through her role as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderfully gruff Tremayne. By far the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner&#39;s own &#39;The Interrogation&#39; compared favourably with &#39;The Prisoner&#39;. I regret that there was never a second series; the concept had so much life left in it. Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron&#39;s affections? What if Tremayne had learned of the Champions&#39; powers? Did the Champions have any other abilities other than those we saw? We never found out, alas.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Scoop&#34; is also the name of a late-Thirties Evelyn Waugh novel, and Woody Allen\&#39;s new movie, though set today, has a nostalgic charm and simplicity. It hasn\&#39;t the depth of characterization, intense performances, suspense or shocking final frisson of Allen\&#39;s penultimate effort &#34;Match Point,&#34; (argued by many, including this reviewer, to be a strong return to form) but &#34;Scoop&#34; does closely resemble Allen\&#39;s last outing in its focus on English aristocrats, posh London flats, murder, and detection. This time Woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy, and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian, a magician called Sid Waterman, stage moniker The Great Splendini, who counters some snobs\&#39; probing with, &#34;I used to be of the Hebrew persuasion, but as I got older, I converted to narcissism.&#34; Following a revelation in the midst of Splendini\&#39;s standard dematerializing act, with Scarlett Johansson (as Sondra Pransky) the audience volunteer, the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace English journalist\&#39;s post-mortem attempt to score one last top news story. On the edge of the Styx Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) has just met the shade of one Lord Lyman\&#39;s son\&#39;s secretary, who says she was poisoned, and she\&#39;s told him the charming aristocratic bounder son Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) was the Tarot Card murderer, a London serial killer. Sondra and Sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths. With Sid\&#39;s deadpan wit and Sondra\&#39;s bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the London aristocracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woody isn\&#39;t pawing his young heroine muse -- as in &#34;Match Point,&#34; Johansson again -- as in the past. This time moreover Scarlett\&#39;s not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star. She\&#39;s morphed surprisingly into a klutzy, bespectacled but still pretty coed. Sid and Sondra have no flirtation, which is a great relief. They simply team up, more or less politely, to carry out Strombel\&#39;s wishes by befriending Lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt. With only minimal protests Sid consents to appear as Sondra\&#39;s dad. Sondra, who\&#39;s captivated Peter by pretending to drown in his club pool, re-christens herself Jade Spence. Mr. Spence, i.e., Woody, keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks, but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker, spewing non-stop one-liners and all the while maintaining, apparently with success, that he\&#39;s in oil and precious metals, just as &#34;Jade&#34; has told him to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\&#39;s about all there is to it, or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome. At first Allen\&#39;s decision to make Johansson a gauche, naively plainspoken, and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision. But Johansson, who has pluck and panache as an actress, miraculously manages to carry it off, helped by Jackman, an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable, if he desires her. The film actually creates a sense of relationships, to make up for it limited range of characters: Sid and Sondra spar in a friendly way, and Peter and Sondra have a believable attraction even though it\&#39;s artificial and tainted (she is, after all, going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What palls a bit is Allen\&#39;s again drooling over English wealth and class, things his Brooklyn background seems to have left him, despite all his celebrity, with a irresistible hankering for. Jackman is an impressive fellow, glamorous and dashing. His parents were English. But could this athletic musical comedy star raised in Australia (&#34;X-Man\&#39;s&#34; Wolverine) really pass as an aristocrat? Only in the movies, perhaps (here and in &#34;Kate and Leopold&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn\&#39;t as strong a film as &#34;Match Point,&#34; but to say it\&#39;s a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong. It has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a TV show, but Woody\&#39;s jokes are far funnier and more original than you\&#39;ll get in any such media affair, and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness. It doesn\&#39;t matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it\&#39;s diverting summer entertainment. On a hot day you don\&#39;t want a heavy meal. The whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment, without crude jokes or bombastic effects; without Vince Vaughan or Owen Wilson. Critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the Allen decline that preceded &#34;Match Point.&#34; Don\&#39;t believe them. He doesn\&#39;t try too hard. Why should he? He may be 70, but verbally, he\&#39;s still light on his feet. And his body moves pretty fast too.&#39;,
   &#34;Acting This film is a very well acted film. I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times; but for the most part, the acting is very good. The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you were to pause it, you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. He sets up every shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera is still, there is a postcard like quality to the screen. When the camera is moving, every shot is planned to understated perfection. But it doesn&#39;t stop there. Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work I&#39;ve seen. His work on this movie made it what it is. This movie is at the top of the list for best Cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but, I believe they missed the point of the movie. It is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other. The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story. The music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores I&#39;ve herd. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world. I will be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;,
   &#39;When I first saw this movie, I thought it was the typical &#34;love thy neighbour&#34; stuff....The more the movie was going on, the more I got involved. Acting is magnificent from both actors, direction was great, the story unusual. Cried my eyes off, first time in my life for a movie. A real must have in any serious videoteque. 11 out of 10&#39;,
   &#39;The Woman In Black was a British made for TV movie which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve of \&#39;89, and again in \&#39;92. I believe it made a round on American TV on A&amp;E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90\&#39;s but went out of print. A U.S. company released it on DVD later, but that version also sold out. According to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won\&#39;t be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks. It\&#39;s certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the DVD says, &#34;made in Canada,&#34; ha ha. But it\&#39;s a good copy, and you can\&#39;t really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the movie. It\&#39;s a period piece set in the 1920\&#39;s, with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time. The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the movie is very low-key, but effective and scary. There is no self indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. It\&#39;s a chilling classic styled ghost movie. The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930\&#39;s except for the color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, I\&#39;m afraid this film will always just be a lost gem. For me, it places itself as one of my all time favorites.&#39;,
   &#39;As a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn\&#39;t take acting too seriously, I\&#39;m always amused by those who treat it as Great Art. This movie skewers the &#34;Actor\&#39;s Craft&#34; mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator. When the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play &#34;the part of a lifetime&#34; by the neo-Nazi head of the secret service. He plays it to the hilt, gets the dictator\&#39;s girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa, and turns the tables on his captors beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of great shtick by the leads, lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors, particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard, and fun little cameos abound. Sammy Davis Jr. makes light of himself, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else going on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and above all Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dumb movie, but it has lots of beautiful locations (in Brazil), a humorous script, and good actors doing their thing and looking like they\&#39;re actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play-acting!&#39;,
   &#39;The movie is great and I like the story. I prefer this movie than other movie such The cell ( sick movie ) and Highlander ( silly movie ). I just tell the truth, I like a reality hehe and also a true story :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;It takes guts to make a movie on Gandhi in India ,in which he is not shown as a man who could do no wrong.This movie shows how a Mahatma failed to be a decent father(at least in the eyes of his son). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances are terrific ,the cinematography fantastic, the direction fabulous,but the film drags.If the intention was to make this movie without any box-office expectations,which i assume is the case here,then its a brilliant attempt,but if the makers were expecting this to be a commercial success,then the film&#39;s fate was doomed the day they chose this subject..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20 yrs from now,this movie will be remembered for the brilliant portrayal of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna.He deserves an Oscar nomination for this one..And honestly,his is not the only performance worth applauding, Shefali Chhaya is terrific too..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the scene where Harilal hears about his father&#39;s death.No dialogues,No screaming,but a speechless shot by Khanna.Its one of the finest scenes ever shot in the history of Cinema&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gandhi,My Father is not at all exciting cinema but yes,its excellent cinema and a must watch.Brilliant Attempt..&#34;,
   &#34;I love this show as it action packed with adventure, love and intrigue. Well some times love! It&#39;s so good see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect. It&#39;s also very good to se Dick Van Dyke in a television role as I have only seen him in Mary Poppins. the mixture of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve is very capturing to the audience. This is a show you have to watch!&#34;,
   &#34;This was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen. The first part of the movie, though strange, has a light and amusing quality to it. The journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of Appalachia. But that is misleading beyond belief. The obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the countryside&#39;s inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie. I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain, and I shudder at the thought. Lewis&#39;s leg made me wince. Yet, while the movie was, on the whole, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. When is it moral, or right to take another individual&#39;s life? What can morality drive us to do, or not do, in some cases? And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? Whatever conclusions one may draw from the film, it is an achievement in its own right (despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome).&#34;,
   &#34;The Matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it, it seems so light. The humor is always medium-gauge, never unfunny but never gut-busting. The story is a very simple thread. The characteristics of the plot are often recycled features, namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straight-laced glass-wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other&#39;s lifestyles. I also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary, as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself. However, it really is a good film, because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time, it wasn&#39;t. It has a subtle way of connecting with the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it&#39;s a formula that is nothing new, even most of the humor, both main characters, virtually the only characters in it, are somehow met and gotten to know. Forget calling them real. That&#39;s not at all what I mean. What I mean is that though Pierce Brosnan&#39;s filthy, womanizing, boozing hit man is a detached comical character, he&#39;s grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by Brosnan, who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh James Bondless air. Greg Kinnear&#39;s character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness, but he&#39;s given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film&#39;s lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later. We then realize the film is not simply Analyze This or Planes, Trains and Automobiles told stalely over again. Its truly saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists. But with its lightness, how can that possibly be the focus of the film, though the plot has been leading up to it? No, the focus is what Brosnan and Kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other. Strangely, The Matador is a film about regret and loneliness. Brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day, and though we don&#39;t understand why Kinnear is so lenient and accepting with Brosnan continually interrupting his life, it&#39;s slowly understood that Brosnan is salvaging Kinnear from a more down-to-earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption. The very last scene of the movie stays with me. It, I think, is where the film&#39;s subtle side-stepping impact finally begins to seep.&#34;,
   &#34;The first time I saw this film, I loved it. It was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Christian (Bible believing). I don&#39;t go along with the crowd of right wing believers. I dropped out of that atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what Judas tried to do. I call it the Judas Syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judas didn&#39;t get it, even though Jesus said his Kingdom was not of this world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film certainly showed some of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also he was a very gorgeous Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a watch-over and over movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfying.&#34;,
   &#39;This is one of those movies that make better trailers than full-length feature films. The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just felt there were missed opportunities to put the &#34;punch&#34; into this movie. So many lines and gags were left hanging too long, with no definite ending and really didn\&#39;t leave me laughing. Wilson, Wilson, Farris &amp; Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was under-used in this film and needed more exposure, and more opportunities to spin her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more of a DVD rental. Also, I was looking for some sort of a feel-good music video during the end credits, something that has become sort of a trade-mark to these romantic comedy films, a la Something About Mary, Meet the Parents but again, I was left feeling a little cheated by fact that this COULD have been a much better film with a little more music and punchier punch lines. It felt like it was RUSHED into theaters.&#39;,
   &#39;There are people claiming this is another &#34;bad language&#34; ultra violence Mexican movie. They are right, but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The awful truth hurts, or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things of &#34;Cero y van cuatro&#34; is the open invitation to profound reflexion over our current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all that we want to be? I am abroad and I realized how spoiled is the Mexican society when the Tlahuac Incident came to light. I still cannot understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcasted murder. I nearly puked when I saw some of the images. It was not Irak or Rwanda, just a tiny village near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government. The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider &#34;Tamales de Chivo&#34; the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is deeper than some &#34;cabrón&#34; and &#34;pendejo&#34; screams. Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people. With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish. Just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country. Moreover, honesty is only rewarded miraculously.&#39;,
   &#34;This documentary was interesting, but it was also long (so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes), like Ben-Hur long. But if your into that, this is for you. But only if you have a passion for movies, like I do. Being that Martin Scorsese is my favorite director (live and maybe even ever), this is quite fascinating, especially if you know the style of Scorsese&#39;s works. Because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films. Not the best documentary film ever made, but it is a leap for Scorsese, which is always good to watch. A&#34;,
   &#34;Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), more than any of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s movies, brings the joy of storytelling to the audience. It is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again; it&#39;s just magical. It&#39;s a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states, but now that it&#39;s here check it out! And stick with the original language; the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat, which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie (or book, whatever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a ten/ten.&#34;,
   &#34;As with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters. But whilst C + J eschew sex for a girly trip back into childhood, this pair revel in their carnality even to the point of exploring homoeroticism. Most of the sex they acquire from grudging or unwilling partners and yet, despite their deeply un-PC behaviour, everyone emerges smiling. Like C + G, through it all they remain innocents at heart, rebels against the quotidien, the bourgeois, the restrictive. As someone else has commented, I wouldn&#39;t want to know these 2 and it&#39;s a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy (and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door) and thus for that reason, it left me beguiled but with a sweet taste in the mouth. Dare I say that only the French can get away with films like this. And that is part of their genius.&#34;,
   &#39;I was initially dubious about this movie (merely because of the subject), but the richly drawn characters, the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt, and the dramatic conclusion make it well-worth watching. I initially had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters but as the movie progressed they increasingly distinguished themselves. I am still haunted by the final scene.&#39;,
   &#34;I can&#39;t understand what it is that fans of the genre didn&#39;t like about this film. It was truly a lot of fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldn&#39;t enjoy the film. I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case. To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both films that I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time. The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck. People liked it for it&#39;s special effects. Films like the Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like funhouse rides. Well with that analogy the Mummy was a B ticket to the Haunting&#39;s E-ticket.&#34;,
   &#34;I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary. The musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an Imax production. Even though it is shot for those huge Imax theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact this would make a perfect DVD to demo your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subject is also so fascinating. It is about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the CART Championship, F1 Championship, The Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son. The first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that Mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection. The other car is Michael&#39;s new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season. Imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Newman, who was Michael Amoretti&#39;s team owner at the time this movie was made, narrates the film. His anecdotes and witticism, drawn from many years as an owner and driver, lends much to the production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main feature is the race scenes. Turn up the volume here! There is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, is loving father who proudly watches over his son&#39;s career. They work together so well that every father and son should see this. You can tell that they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience.&#34;,
   &#39;This is an interesting series that takes real life people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc)...and dramatizes part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story. Railroad Detective &#34;Matt Clark&#34; -- takes a role in tracking down famous outlaws from the Old West in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts. In that sense, it\&#39;s almost an anthology series, and as someone else pointed out, this odd structure poses some timeline conflicts with the real events, but it\&#39;s a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a western-hungry 1950\&#39;s audience -- and it still holds up pretty well 55 years later. Clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of history\&#39;s baddest baddies. And his girl-sidekick Frankie is quite a dish. If you\&#39;re a western fan, be sure to check it out if you have a chance.&#39;,
   &#34;Sometimes I just want to laugh. Don&#39;t you? No analyzing, no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning. Rent this movie, watch it all and laugh your ass off. Don&#39;t want to admit you liked it? Fine. But don&#39;t trash it here when you and I both know you liked it. It&#39;s Damn funny!&#34;,
   &#34;Much about love &amp; life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film. With sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie. Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the \x91Lubitsch touch.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the story is set in Budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this is of no consequence. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy Stewart &amp; Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing it. Their dialogue - so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural - perfectly conveys their confusion &amp; quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates. Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold. An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented. Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments - near the end - when he determines that his store&#39;s newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him. Gentle Felix Bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues, yet remains a steadfast friend to Stewart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk. William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In tiny roles, Charles Halton plays a no-nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor. Movie mavens will recognize Mary Carr &amp; Mabel Colcord - both uncredited - in their single scene as Miss Sullavan&#39;s grandmother &amp; aunt.&#34;,
   &#39;Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The marketing machine has only just begun for this one (no site yet? wth?), so I doubt most of you have heard about it. In truth, I hadn\&#39;t either (sort of). When I got the posting, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when not working so I an enjoy it 100% as a mere mortal movie-goer. Turns out, it wasn\&#39;t Transformers and I had been aware of it way back when as \&#39;that Neil Gaiman movie\&#39;. What is it about? Well, in short, it\&#39;s a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. Any more than that and I\&#39;d be giving away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) spoiling your fun. If you really want to know what it\&#39;s about, go buy the book. Rumour has it, Gaiman might be something of a writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile. And for this one, it certainly was. This screening was \&#39;special\&#39; in that it included not just film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi/fantasy folks. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh how sweetly wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom. But it was not Lord of Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, like Lord of the Rings, it was the, well, humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities. It\&#39;s surely a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humour. And that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick Shrekism. It\&#39;s more along the lines of dramedy than comedy. Before I go on, let\&#39;s do this movie review thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting is, in the very least, good. It\&#39;s always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I do believe there were significant superbly acted roles. Michelle Pfieffer is not, sadly, one of those. She plays a villain, and she does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, though, he was a real jerk. That is, a great villain. Peter O\&#39;Toole is, well, Peter frickin\&#39; O\&#39;Toole -- which is marvelous. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, though, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain\&#39;t never heard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I\&#39;ve always been of mixed opinion with her. She can be great, and then she can seem to miss the mark. In this, she\&#39;s the former. And she is, quite literally, the star of this film. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, she\&#39;s not as good as she can be when Cox isn\&#39;t in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special effects are muted yet accomplished, and only significant where they should be. Best flying ship yet -- sorry Potter. Direction is light-hearted and flows nicely. Cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in New Zealand. All else is top bracket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now that that\&#39;s done...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...the writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you devil. It\&#39;s hard in today\&#39;s climate to do anything original and, at first, you begin to wonder. A kingdom, a dying King, a boy out to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) -- what\&#39;s new? But Gaiman\&#39;s story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart. And, though you suspect how it\&#39;s all going to turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you\&#39;re me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you\&#39;ll find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not. Fantastical and real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan but I won\&#39;t ruin it for you. For those who read the book, rest assured, it\&#39;s done properly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those I spoke to afterward had the same impression I did. A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because, well, you might be expecting it. You\&#39;ll know when you walk out, anyway. I sincerely hope Stardust doesn\&#39;t get lost among the tentpoles. Even if it does, it\&#39;ll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to add the {WITHHELD} reveal. I\&#39;m a few years late, but ... &#34;A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but I\&#39;m still confident that years form now, there will be the same &#34;Oh, I love that movie,&#34; response to this as there is now for The Princess Bride.&#39;,
   &#39;I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who happens to be Einstein\&#39;s niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine\&#39;s heart. Throw a jealous fiancé (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix, and you have pure fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the &#34;RRRatman&#34; and Ryan\&#39;s fiancé; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film fell below most radars, but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.&#39;,
   &#34;I have seen this wonderful production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith&#39;s wife-I am not sure of her character&#39;s name. I went to BYU with her and lost touch with her-her maiden name was Kim Luke-and I wonder if anyone has any info on her. She is not listed in the credits. This production was outstanding, a tear-jerker on all accounts, superb acting by all. I guess I don&#39;t even want to put it in the general category of &#39;acting&#39;, more like &#39;portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the Heavens for this the final dispensation&#39;.....something like that. If anyone worked with Kim or has a website or something please let me know!!! She was fantastic in her role, by the way....Thanks, Melissa Thorne&#34;,
   &#39;Richard Chamberlain is David Burton, a tax lawyer living in Sydney, Australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five Aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in Peter Weir\&#39;s apocalyptic 1977 thriller The Last Wave. Taking up where Picnic at Hanging Rock left off, the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and, in the process, shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions. Weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been &#34;domesticated&#34;, their tribal laws and culture no longer apply. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the start, Burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and &#34;dream time&#34; evaporates. Water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to Burton\&#39;s discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps. As violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky, the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear. Burton and his wife Annie (Olivia Hamnet) study books about the Aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions. When he invites one of his clients Chris Lee (David Gulpilil) to his home for dinner, he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by Chris and his friend Charlie (Nadjiwarra Amagula), an enigmatic Aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants. As Burton\&#39;s investigation continues, his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Chris starts to appear in his dreams, Burton is convinced that the Aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because &#34;he saw too much&#34;, though Chris refuses to acknowledge this in court. Burton, becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel, says to his stepfather priest, &#34;Why didn\&#39;t you tell me there were mysteries?&#34; This is a legitimate question but, according to the reverend, the Church answers all mysteries. Burton knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves. Though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream, he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this period of history in which native Hopi and Mayan prophecies predict the &#34;end of history&#34; and the purification of man leading to the Fifth World, The Last Wave, though 25 years old, is still timely. The Aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture, not one completely subjugated by the white man, yet I am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not quite seeing. Weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality, but he perpetuates the doom-orientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear, showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time.&#39;,
   &#39;I had the TV on for a white noise companion and heard&#34; $400 for a fully furnished apartment&#34; So I ran into the TV room expecting another 70\&#39;s flick and got much more. Luckily, I could rewind to the beginning (DVR buffer) and hit the record button to watch it entirely.(Cinemax uncut and in HD no less!) Aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog/events, this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. Pretty creepy and progressive at times: Beverly D\&#39;Angelo\&#39;s character masturbates in front of Alison Parker, played adroitly by Cristina Raines, Parker stabs, in very gory fashion, her father, an explicit menage a trios scene.( don\&#39;t let the kids watch) The film is TOTALLY 70\&#39;s full of bad clothes(polyester suits and tacky ascots) and decor, bad hair,over bloated music score, and familiar looking cinematography. The cast is excellent, take a second on this film\&#39;s home page to check it out.It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles- always wonderfully creepy! ENJOY!&#39;,
   &#34;The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than those other shows. No laugh tracks, no painful jokes, just a program. The Sarah Silverman program. If you&#39;re like me, and you love comedy, this is probably a show for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Silverman brings out-there-funny, and right-here-funny to the table with ease. A mix of different styles, which makes for its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This program isn&#39;t something you want to start a compare war with, seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows). This show is its own entity, and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go watch and see.&#34;,
   &#34;Partially from the perceived need, one feels, to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950&#39;s movie-going public. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts with some wickedly funny characterizations of the upper-class bureaucrats running the Foreign Office --- the British are pilloried in the way that only the British can pillory themselves. But after that, the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot. Terry-Thomas watchable as always, but the great talent in the cast (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diverting, but not great film.&#34;,
   &#39;I hand\&#39;t seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of &#34;Baby Face&#34; with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she\&#39;s been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he\&#39;s killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city ( New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in great style!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily\&#39;s sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! STanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn\&#39;t know what love is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he\&#39;s in deep financial straights, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pre-code Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect. This reminded me of &#34;Original Sin&#34; with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like Baby FAce any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will love it. Highly recommended! See it!&#39;,
   &#39;I thought this had the right blend of character, plot, futuristic stuff and special effects without going over board. It will take a while to get going, but the acting was good and I was intrigued by the angel who is not to hard to look at. I like the attitude too! Certainly not like other attempts at futuristic stories.&#39;,
   &#34;I do find it a bit overrated. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve never seen a subtitled version (dubbing stinks!), but I just don&#39;t get into it like a lot of other people do. The finale is really great though as Jackie trashes a mall, a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping!&#34;,
   &#34;I was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time. The Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension, especially when landing, yet the specially effects when the Krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago! Living in the middle east I saw shades of Islam creep in when JJ Adams suggested Alta should dress more modestly, and as an engineer, was amazed by the imagination used for the &#39;futuristic&#39; gadgets, and gizmos dreamed up by the props department. All in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a &#39;young&#39; man&#34;,
   &#34;Dick Tracy wasn&#39;t the best for many comic book fans, because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villains that have severe appearance disorder and being fun. Warren Beatty directs and stars as the main character that fights crime without even using super powers. I have liked Dick Tracy since I was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children. Al Pacino is like the Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with zest. Madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this film doesn&#39;t play the same boy toy she represents. Like I said, no blood, obscenities, sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody.&#34;,
   &#34;Reign Over Me (titled after the who song) is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyone&#39;s eye. It was a moving story of a guy (sandler) that lost his family in the 9-11 world trade center attacks. Years later, he runs into an old college roommate (cheadle) that he doesn&#39;t even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress ensued by the loss of his family. The two rekindle their old friendship and Cheadle&#39;s character, Johnson, realizes that he must get Sandler&#39;s character, Fineman, some help before it&#39;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time. It&#39;s completely worth watching and after seeing it, I&#39;m positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more.&#34;,
   &#34;It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. It&#39;s actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it&#39;s flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it&#39;s made in the 90s, it doesn&#39;t have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I&#39;m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can&#39;t hate it. I think it&#39;s an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.&#34;,
   &#39;This series premiered on the cable TV station &#34;Comedy Central&#34; in the United States. It was chopped to death, and shown out of sequence. This was sad for the audience it should have attracted, it didn\&#39;t and fell by the wayside. Luckily, at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC. Thank goodness because I got to see &#34;The League of Gentlemen&#34; in order, complete and uncut. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The League of Gentlemen&#34; troupe is right up there with England\&#39;s &#34;Monty Python\&#39;s Flying Circus&#34; and Canada\&#39;s &#34;The Kids in the Hall&#34;. But..a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The League of Gentlemen&#34; though are one step beyond. It\&#39;s not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills, it goes deeper and much, much, darker. I can tell many of you now -- it will offend certain groups of people, it will enrage others. But remember, its only comedy..dark, dark comedy. If that is not your thing, don\&#39;t watch. If you think you KNOW dark comedy, watch this -- if you get angry and upset, then you don\&#39;t quite know DARK COMEDY. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys got it right, and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I enjoyed each and every character creation. There\&#39;s a COMPLETE story that is told here from episode one to the end. You cannot watch this one episode at a time, willy nilly, that is one of the charms of this series. Watch it in order. See how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are. No one and nothing is out of bounds. That, my dears, is &#34;dark humor&#34;. Bravo!&#39;,
   &#34;I was pleased to see that she had black hair! I&#39;ve been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer, it didn&#39;t spoil it at all. In fact I watched the film twice in one day, a sure sign that it was up to standard. This is what I do with books that I like as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip. I would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly. Has he actually read the books?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation.&#34;,
   &#34;The kids, aged 7 to 14, got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year. They all loved it! Kids from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and frequently, and we get a kick out of watching it with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s rare that a film entertains the kids for so long, and offers laughs for the adults, too. Most enjoy it more than the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top-quality production and an excellent cast, led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George--athletic, energetic, and wholly credible, with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the face--well supported by the inimitable Christina Pickles as the evil mother-in-law, Thomas Haden Church as the evil jerk rival, and everybody else. This is fun.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable. The violence was a little extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film. The ending is amazing and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever. Great movie and you will probably really enjoy it.&#39;,
   &#39;...here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say that I was BLOWN AWAY by this short film. I saw it, randomly, when I was in Boston at a film festival and I have thanked god for it every day since. I really, truly believe I was part of a happening, like reading a Tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of Mean Streets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products, but I so hope I can be there for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, a truly incredible piece of film making.&#39;,
   &#39;First off, I want to say, &#34;Thanks, Disney, for finally releasing the &#34;Cinderella&#34; movie on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated films on DVD (including the 1999 Limited Editions)! What are you going to do next? You\&#39;re going to Disney World!!!!!&#34; Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, Disney remains magical in his 1950 animated classic film &#34;Cinderella,&#34; the movie that put fairy tale movies on the map. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her stepsisters, her date, the glass slipper, the pumpkin that turns into a carriage just for saying &#34;Bippity- boppity-boo!,&#34; and of course, trying to head home by midnight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this film: It\&#39;s a grand old fairy tale that children like, now in a movie form (as well as on DVD as well)!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Cinderella&#34; - thank you, Disney!!!!! 10 stars.&#39;,
   &#34;I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#39;s &#39;Passionate Eye&#39; series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite remarkable film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the way it should be. What we get to see what &#39;embedded&#39; journalism should really be. What we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;A SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy/Canada 1977).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every once in a while, you come across a film that really touches a nerve. This one offers a very simple premise, almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It\&#39;s surprising Ettore Scola\&#39;s &#34;Una giornate particulare&#34; is relatively unheralded, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it \&#39;rubbish\&#39; and Leonard Maltin, somewhat milder, \&#39;pleasant but trifling.\&#39; I disagree, not only because this film is deeply moving, but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films I\&#39;ve seen. The cinematography is distinctly unflashy, even a bit bland, and the storyline straightforward, which might explain the film\&#39;s relative unpopularity. Considering late \&#39;70s audiences weren\&#39;t exactly spoiled with great Italian films, it\&#39;s even stranger this one didn\&#39;t really catch on with the critics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archive footage from Hitler\&#39;s visit to Italy on may 8th 1938. Set against this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely, love-ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building. One day, when her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbour Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies. He is well-mannered, cultured and soon she is attracted to him. During the whole film, we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard. Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings. After the opening scene, the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist (hypermodern at the time) apartment block, seemingly searching for our main characters, whom we haven\&#39;t met yet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles, all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type. Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren\&#39;s husband, but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. I figure his voice must have been dubbed, since he\&#39;s not of Italian descent and never lived there, to my knowledge, so I cannot imagine he speaks Italian. If his voice has been dubbed, I didn\&#39;t notice at all. On the contrary, he\&#39;s completely believable as an Italian, even more than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective, the performances are outstanding, the ending is just perfect and the framing doesn\&#39;t come off as overly pretentious but works completely. Don\&#39;t miss out on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Camera Obscura --- 9/10&#39;,
   &#34;As a Westerner watching another culture&#39;s view and tradition of marriag, I found Just Married mesmerizing and delightful. The idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet this is the case in this Hindi film. Told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of Abhay and Ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. As said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. We see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. There&#39;s song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. Granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived; however the overall movie was worth watching.&#34;,
   &#34;Having ran across this film on the Fox movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I can think of no better way to spend a lazy Friday evening then putting in my two cents worth. Especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it. Doesn&#39;t every movie, good or bad deserve more than four comments? And this movie isn&#39;t bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like April Love is to remember the era from which it came, in this case the late fifties. Films were pretty much a happy medium back then. The cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen Technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television. I don&#39;t know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one, but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teen sent to live with his Aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O&#39;Connell) out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car. It seems that his Aunt and Uncle have lost their own son (Jed Jr.)so Uncle Jed seems has lost his zest for living. Aunt Henrietta is hoping that Nick being on the farm will somehow bring Jed out of his doldrums. Story lines like this being what they are, Jed and Nick don&#39;t really care for each other too much of course. Jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels)and Liz (Shirley Jones)Templeton. Immediately Jed develops a crush on Fran, and of course I don&#39;t have to tell you that Liz develops a crush on Jed. Then there&#39;s the matter of Uncle Jed&#39;s horse, a trotter who has turned wild and won&#39;t let anyone handle him since the death of Jed Jr. You could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own, seeing as how there are no real surprises. Doesn&#39;t matter though, you&#39;ll enjoy yourself anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get over the image of squeaky clean Pat Boone, as a supposedly bad boy, you&#39;ll have no trouble with the rest of the film. Considering that, Boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as Nick. Certainly the role doesn&#39;t require much depth, but still it&#39;s a nicely done job when you would least expect it. As Jed, Arthur O&#39;Connell is the perfect choice for the role. In the early going, he is unreachable and cold, but as he slowly warms up to Nick, we see that he&#39;s really a pretty good guy. Jeannette Nolan is a lot of fun as Henrietta, who is constantly playing the part of mediator between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones takes a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents. As Liz, she&#39;s gorgeous to look at, great to listen to, and quite funny at times. Dolores Michaels as Fran, who is a bit more on the wild side, is equally entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about April Love, is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen. Not one true villain in the whole thing. Everybody is so darn likable you can&#39;t help but enjoy the film. I truthfully find it quite refreshing, sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as the old Andy Griffith show with musical numbers, a little more plot, and wide screen Technicolor. The songs are a mixed bag, with the title song April Love being the best of them. Another thing I really liked is that they didn&#39;t fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences, and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it. As a matter of fact, you&#39;ll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they didn&#39;t skimp in that department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. Best of all is how the dislike between Nick and Jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie will never be confused with great cinema. Yet, sometimes instead of going to Disneyland, one just needs a nice outing in the park, and that&#39;s what April Love is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: B+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;This may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time &amp; through time to when one\&#39;s childhood starts a journey to reminiscences back &amp; forth onwards &amp; upwards,forwards &amp; backwards,up &amp; down &amp; all around.The boy Jimmy,H.R.

The latter day inspirations of Lidsville,&#34;The Brady Kids Saturday Morning Preview Special&#34; Sigmund &amp; the Sea Monsters,and Land of the lost both the new &amp; old are what this very show bridged the gap to as well as The Donny &amp; Marie Show,The Brady Bunch Variety Hour a.k.a.

   &#39;Dani(Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close with her older sister Maureen(Emily Warfield) until they both start falling in love with their neighbor Court(Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was truly a heartbreaking story about first love. Probably the most painful story about young love that I have ever seen. All the acting is amazing and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance in her first movie. I would give The Man in the Moon 8.5/10&#39;,
   &#39;Stylishly directed, picturesquely photographed and brilliantly acted \x97 Crosby\&#39;s interpretation seems exactly right, Hardwicke has his best role ever, while Bendix is a treat too \x97 this Yankee\&#39;s appeal is universal and irresistible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the principal joys of the movie, of course, are the songs. As might be expected, Bing is in fine voice. And although Hardwicke\&#39;s solo has been cut, we can still hear him sing heartily as he dances merrily with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number, &#34;Busy Doing Nothing&#34;. It\&#39;s also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing looks\x97and she looks very fetching indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget, using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, but who\&#39;s complaining?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment delight from start to finish.&#39;,
   &#39;If you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a classic fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role. His trademark style of acting works well for the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are well for their parts. I did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward. The king in particular appears a real dunce though, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original tale. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all. I know I&#39;ve personally run into this many times. Thank goodness Will Smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text messaging while driving. People, don&#39;t do it. An hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause. Personally, I wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie. I was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn. I decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, make them watch this vital Public Service Announcement on text messaging while driving or they could kill seven people. Thanks for showing us the way.&#34;,
   &#34;All of those who voted less than 5 are obviously not fans of clean, tongue-in-cheek humor. Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work. This is not a blockbuster, bigger-than-life affair. This is campy, slapstick humor played out by some of Hollywood&#39;s best (and very versatile) actors. Piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee, once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed, you gotta see Dimitri do his piece as Morone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 7.&#34;,
   &#34;I must say as a girl with a cowboy of my own,I love this flick.It left me lovin them boots and wranglers even more.I told my friend about it and she loved it just as much,we were &#39;bout 13 at the time.I think it&#39;s the greatest love story ever told!I own it and never get tired of Bud &amp; Sissy.&#34;,
   &#39;Elvira Mistress Of The Dark (1988): Cassandra Peterson, Daniel Greene, William Morgan Sheppard, Susan Kellerman, Edie McClug, Jeff Conaway, Phil Rubenstein, Larry Flash Jenkins, Tress MacNeille, Damita Jo Freeman, Mario Celario, William Dance, Lee McLaughlin, Charles Woolf, Sharon Hays, Bill Cable, Joseph Arias, Scott Morris, Ira Heiden, Frank Collison, Lynne Marie Stewart, Marie Sullivan, Jack Fletcher, Robert Benedetti, Kate Brown, Hugh Gillin, Eve Smith, Raleigh Bond, Tony Burrier, Alan Dewames, Timm Hill, Read Scot, James Hogan, Derek Givens...Director James Signorelli...Screenplay Sam Egan, John Paragon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elvira, Mistress of the Dark was an 80\&#39;s TV icon who had her own late night show on cable. She hosted and presented classic American horror films, many of them campy, while providing her own quips and humorous remarks. Actress Cassandra Peterson has to this date ridden on that success. In 1988, her first film was released. Playing herself, she\&#39;s stuck hosting monster movie shows but longs for her own show in Las Vegas and make big money. Her agent Manny proves a disappointment. It\&#39;s not long before she inherits a mansion from a deceased relative, a pet dog and a book of recipes. She comes to claim her inheritance in a small Nevada town - she was on her way to Vegas and became lost - and soon stirs things up in the sedate community. Outspoken conservative town council woman Chastity Pariah (Edie McClurg) soon sees her as a threat to the decency and values of the small town. Her voluptuous figure and winning personality soon draws the youth of the town. She falls for Bob Redding (Daniel Greene) the town handyman/carpenter, but before any real relationship can bloom, she finds herself in deep trouble. Vincent Talbot (William Morgan Sheppard) an eerie older man who is also set to inherit part of the fortune of Elvira\&#39;s relative is in fact an age-old sorcerer who has a personal vendetta against Elvira\&#39;s aunt and Elvira herself. He is aware that the so-called &#34;recipe book&#34; is actually a book of powerful magic, a power he wishes to claim for himself. He schemes to bring down Elvira by having the town burn her at the stake. How will Elvira get out of this one ? The movie was no real success at the box office, drawing a crowd of mostly young audiences familiar with the Elvira show on cable. Truth be told, this is a funny and feel-good movie. The script is chalk full of all kinds of jokes, some bad, some good, lots of sexual innuendo, visual jokes and overall campiness i.e. the hilarious last scene in which Elvira has finally got her own strip show in Vegas. This film is a cult classic of sorts, catering to Elvira fans. You couldn\&#39;t enjoy this film otherwise. It\&#39;s also a look back at &#34;pop&#34; culture of the 80\&#39;s. Elvira was as much an icon of the 80\&#39;s as was Alf, Vicky the Robot, Hulk Hogan, Mr. T and Madonna.&#39;,
   &#34;The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy (duh), is lacking a bit in the story department, but covers it with extensive action scenes! Twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director and star (Damon) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story-wise. How they got around that? The action scenes, for once, but they did another thing too, which I can&#39;t reveal, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, than you&#39;ll notice it! Funnily enough I read, that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you :o)&#34;,
   &#39;This has to be one of my favourite flicks, unlike the weak \&#39;Elvira\&#39;s Haunted Hills\&#39;...anyway I love the way the movie is a goth/com \&#39;Wizard of Oz\&#39; story...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elvira is a goth Dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a Good Witch (elviras Aunt Morgana)...she inherits a &#34;Ruby&#34; ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the Bad Warlock (Her uncle)...She befriends four Characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow. There is a show down with her uncle (the wicked witch of the West) where Elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him. In the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination Las Vegas (Dorothy\&#39;s home in Kansas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie...she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: &#34;Youe must be aunt Em, and you must be uncle Remus....There\&#39;s no place like home, there\&#39;s no place like home!&#34; Bad uncle Vinny: &#34;I\&#39;ll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a sign that Elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of Kansas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But aside from this, the fact that one of the sequences she &#34;ripped off, um...I mean was inspired by FlashDance&#34; is pure genius...and if you don\&#39;t roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her &#34;very 80\&#39;s&#34; Las Vegas show then you haven\&#39;t got a camp bone in your body...This movie is a Cult/Camp Classic&#39;,
   &#39;****SPOILERS**** The film &#34;Sniper&#34; is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary US Marine sniper Carlos &#34;Gunny&#34; Hathcock. The unassuming soft-spoken Mister Rogers look-alike who ran up a score of as much as 300 confirmed and unconfirmed Vietcong and North Vietnamese military kills during his two tours in &#34;Nam&#34;.Which shows just how deadly and effective a trained military sniper really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Berenger is cool clam and deadly as Sgt.Thomas Beckett who\&#39;s at the end of his career as a top US Marine sniper but who later in the movie realizes that a life as a civilian will be pointless. Since there\&#39;s nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the US Marines unless he decides to become a mob hit-man. Backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of the film &#34;Sniper&#34; is focused on Sgt.Beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and US government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane, being sent deep inside the Panamanian jungle. The two snipers are to take out rebel General Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa, and Colombian drug king-pin Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, who\&#39;s supporting him in a planned a military take-over of the country. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We see earlier in the movie Sgt. Beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which I feel was the best scene in &#34;Sniper&#34;. For it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. There\&#39;s also a sub-plot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who was stalking Beckett and who later killed Papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter. You would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but Sgt. Beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching DeSilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting Miller as bait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a Rambo-like ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a London fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Sniper&#34; is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies: A solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy.&#39;,
   &#39;Before the regular comments, my main curiosity about THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG is that while there\&#39;s a running time listed on IMDb of 94 minutes, the DVD from Wellspring Media in the United States runs 88 minutes. Any input on this is appreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two friends with very rough lives take on the road for an adventure. What they wind up in is just that, with one accidentally shooting a girl and the two escaping by foot into the countryside. Rather than just a big chase, the film is complicated by the the daft and rather childlike Spike behaving inappropriately, and clutching his boom box like a teddy bear. Some viewers may dislike the story based solely upon the character Spike, but without a bit of frustration added to the story, the film would have been too easy. You\&#39;ll notice the way the more stable character Heaton refers to Spike as &#34;big man&#34; in contrast to Spike\&#39;s &#34;kid out of control&#34; attitude and behavior. Frankly, I too was aggravated by Spike\&#39;s ridiculous actions, especially the spray can sniffing, but in a desperate situation it\&#39;s apparent someone of his mentality would choose an temporary escape. But, Heaton was there to keep things in check up until things get way over his head as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a marvel, and after a while I quit wondering why in the heck he would want to pick Spike up from prison and continue a friendship, due to Glenaan\&#39;s great performance. After all, there are many many reasons during their run that would be a good idea for Heaton to just ditch Spike and try to save himself. I suppose Heaton felt like a protective older brother to Spike, and the loyalty between the two is hard to break -- until things get too desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some of the cinematography is indeed artsy, it does offer more flavor to story instead of just shots of the men running through the wilderness. The beautiful landscapes, rain, and vast gray skies offer a somber tone that increases the feel of the tragic circumstances. The score is unusual as well, and the use of Public Image Ltd.\&#39;s song &#34;This Is Not A Love Song&#34; and as the title of the film is quite smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it\&#39;s understandable if you don\&#39;t care for THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG as it\&#39;s focused on two contrasting personalities escaping from another man determined to hunt them down (played by a cool, quiet David Bradley). It\&#39;s not big-budget action entertainment. For the rest of us that enjoy seeking out something minimal and dramatic, it\&#39;s time worthwhile spent, and it DOES offer some extremely tense moments that have you holding your breath a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m really enjoying the films coming out of Scotland recently, with the likes of this one, Dog Soldiers, and The Devil\&#39;s Tattoo. I\&#39;m also a bit thankful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, as the accents are sometimes lightning fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrating, dark, and often tense, THIS IS NOT A LOVE SONG is very tragic yet engrossing storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the \&#39;End Time.\&#39; In this movie called &#34; The Last Wave &#34; an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it\&#39;s frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Good silent drama. ****&#39;,
   &#34;I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood/bollywood film and I am glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married. When Jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is her coach. When her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi&#39;s) wedding. At the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.&#34;,
   &#34;It&#39;s this sort of movie that you try and imitate. By attempting to realise something... then flying through the air almost immediately. I&#39;d like to do that and I know you would too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!&#34;,
   &#34;One can only imagine the film Mr. Welles might have finished without the interference of the studio! This film is a flawed Welles, but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps America&#39;s best motion picture director of all times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can see the toll it took on Orson Welles the filming of this movie. The story has a lot of holes in it, perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn&#39;t trust the director. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. Lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the Film Forum in New York just ended, or his films either on tape or DVD form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, as a blonde, she is just too stunning for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles body of work, was his own appearance in it. Had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O&#39;Hara, a different film might have been achieved altogether. Orson Welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street. The visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work, the vision and the talent he gave us.&#34;,
   &#39;It is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this. It\&#39;s truly one of the best acted, most tightly structured films I\&#39;ve ever seen. Every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, relating to each of the three main characters differently. The film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go. Add to this that the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye is as moving as anything that\&#39;s ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film. It exposes the romance of movies such as &#34;Titanic&#34; as the trite cliches they are. If you\&#39;re looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry, this isn\&#39;t it. You have to commit yourself to this film. You can\&#39;t have a conversation while running in and out of the room. This movie demands your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve and you\&#39;ll get a lot out of it. Unless you think &#34;Titanic&#34; is the greatest film ever.&#39;,
   &#34;While i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem. I don&#39;t know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is Deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle. Thrown together by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was sorely lacking in special features. Oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring. But all in all a excellent movie.&#34;,
   &#39;Nothing revolutionary here; just impeccably elegant, restrained cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GARDE A VUE is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station, and mostly to one interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS, among others) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography. Miller\&#39;s restraint, especially early on, is breathtaking, and his exquisite handling of the consequently-pivotal interior mise-en-scene makes for captivating viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lino Ventura is superb as usual, succeeding to legitimize a character that, on paper, is cliche: the laconic, hard-nosed, world-weary homicide detective. Ventura lives the role, making it completely believable, even though the script allows us little access to his inner workings; the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michel Serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child-killer who shrewdly spars with the single-minded flic. The exchanges between the two are more-often-than-not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits. Serrault\&#39;s character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning, and pitiable; then later....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;message&#34; of GARDE A VUE, if one were to search for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over-zealous to, if necessary, close cases at the expense of justice. For most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage, a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates, in micro, which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation, and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall, as an example, that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance, with great wisdom, Solomon describes in these words:&#34;The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint, the tainted sister of Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant, a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers, cognitive and mediumistic, this hardened woman, loyal to his blunt, conservative husband, is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., the bastard child of Senator, who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film moves the bowels, we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated, but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all, life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August.&#39;,
   &#39;Gundam Wing to me happens to be a good anime. A bit slow moving (especially around the middle of the series), but over all enjoyable. Now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a &#34;winger&#34;, I will admit that I have watched all of the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, The 08th MS Team, and Gundam SEED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be &#34;rip-offs&#34; (i.e. Zechs Marquise to the original Gundam\&#39;s Char), but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series, as is SEED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original Gundam first, and then know that you are watching an AU series.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change. As usual the lovers--Sally Field as almost-over-the-hill soap opera queen, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline as marginally employed and marginally talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson--are working at cross purposes, seemingly unaware that they are madly in love, etc. Owing a little to Bette Davis&#39;s Margo Channing in All About Eve (1950) and a whole lot to the slapstick theatrical tradition, Sally Field goes over the top towards hilarity as she malaprops her way to love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the more underrated leading men of recent years, is also very good and very winning as he manages to be handsome, vulnerable, egotistical and lovable all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The misadventures center around Celeste&#39;s fear of losing her audience as she has entered her forties, and reach the crisis point with the arrival of her niece, aspiring actress Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue) who turns out NOT to be her niece, with ensuing plot complications. Cori manages to get a small part in the soap opera as a homeless deaf mute before discovering her true relationship to Celeste (and to Jeffrey Anderson as well)--but never mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are Robert Downey Jr. (soap opera director, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan). David Barnes is oh so hot for her, but she cares only about one thing: getting rid of Celeste so that she might shine more brightly on the set. To this end she gets Barnes to do all sorts of things to wreck Celeste&#39;s career, but through happenstance and/or a perverse logic, all his attempts go awry, much to the delight of the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the show&#39;s chief writer and Celeste&#39;s alter-ego and confidant while Carrie Fisher has a modest part as the hard-as-nails producer of the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world that I have seen (Young Doctors in Love 1982 which burlesqued TV&#39;s General Hospital and was pretty good). Soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh-out-loud one-liners and terrific performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr. But see this for Sally Field who is outstanding.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie surprised me, it had good one-liners and laughs, + a nonstop action-packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions. This movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns. The plot is solid despite what others may think, it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end. In conclusion; this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on.&#39;,
   &#34;In a performance both volatile and graceful, Al Pacino re-teams with Sea of Love director, Harold Becker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As New York Mayor John Pappas in City Hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A savvy thriller thats the first film ever shot inside the lower Manhattan structure that&#39;s ground zero for the City&#39;s government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That the other NYC locations provide the vivid settings as an idealistic mayoral aide (John Cusack) follows a trail of subversion and cover-up that may loop back to the man he serves and reveres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Martin Landau, Tony Franciosa and David Paymer add more starry brilliance to this gripping tale of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the power behind power.&#34;,
   &#39;Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, this has to rank as one of the strangest, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially Anders. His character, &#34;George Grisby,&#34; is one of the strangest people I\&#39;ve ever seen on film. His voice, and some of the things he said, have to be heard to be believed. Slaone isn\&#39;t far behind in the &#34;strange&#34; category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blonde hair but still is Hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. Welles\&#39; is as fascinating as always. One tip: if you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff! As bizarre as this film is, I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.&#39;,
   &#39;Despite the lack of logic present in the storyline, Kill Shot is a highly enjoyable film. Through a moving performance Kasper Van Dien brilliantly portrays the emotional rift between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son. Each member of the supporting cast pitches in with a solid performance, highlighted by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name I cannot recall. A shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers, but as a whole Kill Shot truly delivers a death blow.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional Indian values which are being replaced by western ones.Its a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative around.Shahid Kapoor gives a gr88 performance as a desi about to tie knot with Amrita Rao who is also very Desi and she also acts pretty well...The genre of the movie is the same as HAHK and such movies deserve to be made in India for the revival of old traditional values...The movies doesn&#39;t get 10 as it isn&#39;t very good at music which counts a lot in every movie,besides this it is flawless....&#34;,
   &#34;I saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned Video Nasty &#39;Blood Rites&#39;. As Blood Rites was entirely awful, I really wasn&#39;t expecting much from this film; but actually, it would seem that trash director Andy Milligan has outdone himself this time as Seeds of Sin tops Blood Rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation. The plot is actually quite similar to Blood Rites, as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; there is an inheritance at stake. The film is shot in black and white, and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic &#39;The Curious Dr Humpp&#39;. There&#39;s barely any gore on display, and the director seems keener to focus on sex, with themes of incest and hatred seeping through. The acting is typically trashy, but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing, as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful. The plot is paper thin, and most of the film is filler; but the music is catchy, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves, as most are somewhat erotic. Overall, this is not a great film; but it&#39;s likely to appeal to the cult fan, and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality &#39;Blood Rites&#39;.&#34;,
   &#34;I first saw this as a child living in East London. The scars of Hitlers Luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street. I remember having nightmares after seeing it. The odd thing is, it really hasn&#39;t dated if viewed as a piece of social history in Cinema fiction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from a globally destructive war, the scale of the machines was badly awry, more Nano-Technology now, but overall, an excellent and well-crafted work. It was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then. I would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts. However, much was right. Mans desire for war, mans inhumanity to man. The means of war as a catalyst for development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;As others have commented, I checked this out after Siskel and Ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year. What a gift. I then went out to buy it, just so that I could loan it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best quote? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone (Cage) is on top of his cab. When Cage peers down, he apologizes. &#34;I\&#39;m sorry if I scared you.&#34; Yoakum thrusts his pistol in Cage\&#39;s face with &#34;Does THIS look like I\&#39;m scared?&#34; Great bit of humor after an exciting (and temporary) escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really was a sense of fun to this. The constant sighting of the &#34;Welcome to Red Rock&#34; sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake. The music created a hunting, eerie quality to the film reminiscent of &#34;Twin Peaks&#34;. Unlike &#34;Twin Peaks&#34;, though, it doesn\&#39;t spoil things by going too far into the outlandish, needing to &#34;top&#34; itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit watching the credits 15-20 times. You see, they had Yoakum\&#39;s &#34;Thousand Miles from Nowhere&#34; (perfectly chosen) playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor . . with snow-capped mountains in the distance. This was incredible, fluid framing. Further, I\&#39;ve never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film. Also, it totally fit the story.&#39;,
   &#39;I had pleasure to watch the short film &#34;The Cure&#34;, by first time director Ryan Jafri. What really impress me are the camera work and music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think many young filmmakers (as I myself am one of them) would experience hard time with cinematography when just start making of an indie. We see the output are not exactly what we imaged or below our ambitions. But this film, directorial debut from a young director, handled very well on screen. The camera motion, color, lighting, compositing all contribute to the story and emotion of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And music, as a key element of film language, helps a great deal too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s hard to portray a woman\&#39;s heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a short. But still, I have to admit I am not a fan of v/o (narration), especially when the film is advanced by narration, instead of shots and cuts. My personal feeling to some of the narrative part is, my guess was the narrator tried a bit too hard. So the energy pushes audience back from the emotion of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it\&#39;s a short film nicely done, I could see the input from a director. Way to go, Ryan! Greeting from China, looking forward to your next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tim&#39;,
   &#34;Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in August of 1939. So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line, the line didn&#39;t change until a couple of months later. Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was. Lukas&#39;s nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas&#39;s wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her, but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it. It&#39;s the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner, a much lighter play than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days. After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe, Davis Lukas, and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War. They&#39;re made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fly in this ointment are some other house guests, a friend of Davis&#39;s from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe, a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas&#39;s anti-fascist background. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His suspicions are quite correct, it&#39;s the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they&#39;ve become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman&#39;s significant other. Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count. He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other anti-fascist classic, Casablanca. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it&#39;s an item firmly planted in those specific times, Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern anti-fascist message that bears repeating infinitely.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;The big goodbye&#34; introduces us to the first holodeck adventure, in this case Captain Picard posing as private investigator Dixon Hill. This episodes creates some sort of standard pattern, repeated several times on TNG as well as DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game (represented by the failure of the holodeck\&#39;s safety program). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This concept is used to expand Star Trek\&#39;s possibility and enabling a kind of genre-mix. Picard\&#39;s Dixon Hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as Film Noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead (see for example Chandler\&#39;s Marlowe stories or Polanski\&#39;s all time classic &#34;Chinatown&#34;). Star Trek never focuses on the story (mostly it\&#39;s a simple &#34;how-do-we-get-out-of-here&#34; scenario) but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters. Those Holodeck &#34;games&#34; are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. Therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound (but did Star Trek ever had a technical, scientific point to it, I mean besides some utopic concepts?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The big goodbye&#34; shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart, a McFadden that hardly ever looked better in a Star Trek episode (at least the early ones) and Data has some great scenes, too (although I find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp\&#39;s plug out of the wall would have really surprised him, for the fact that he\&#39;d done research on that period and its customs). Wesley continues turning peaceful Trekkies into potential murderers (why didn\&#39;t they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off?) but all in all this one\&#39;s fun...&#39;,
   &#34;Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on TV now. The way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today&#39;s shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side. The way mark&#39;s brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking, and if you think you do, you are wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diagnosis Murder has tackled a diverse range of topics, not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives. Everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for it being for old people? I am 24!! I don&#39;t think i can be classed as old yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so that i can watch them all in order. They seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit!&#34;,
   &#39;Actually this movie has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it\&#39;s much worse than other MJ movies like &#34;The Wiz&#34;, &#34;Captain Eo&#34; and &#34;Ghosts&#34;. But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yeah, that\&#39;s half my life, you guys!), I can\&#39;t complain too much about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to Heaven for me. But as a movie, it\&#39;s not good at all, and I\&#39;m afraid, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my darling Mike hadn\&#39;t been the one starring in it. But since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker, it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me.&#39;,
   &#39;The movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do. The films props itself as a fun and entertaining time. And that\&#39;s exactly what it was. It is the Korean version of a male Bring It On.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a carbon copy of another. Instead, the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining &#34;thugs&#34; came to be men in their own right. Therefore, the film is fun and entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera work, specially the dolly moves were very well executed. The script, being a tad weak, was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire. This film will not win any Oscars, nor any DVD blockbuster sales, but a fun watch and a fun experience.&#39;,
   &#34;The story would never win awards, but that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about... the script was just entertaining and suspenseful enough to make room for the incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Who needs a story with fighting like that? Really, it&#39;s worth watching for that reason alone. IF you can handle the gore, of which there is a LOT... none of it done realistically enough to be tough to look at. I gave it a 7.&#34;,
   &#39;To suggest Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly. In Dig! which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, we watch him and his band self-sabotage over seven years, while ex-friends and contemporaries The Dandy Warhols rise to comparative greatness (a mobile phone advert, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What elevates Dig! above its contemporaries is the immense, near-biblical comic-tragedy being played out: a depressingly honest treatise on art versus commerce and compromise. For all his &#34;look at me, I\&#39;m a bloody genius&#34; posturing, Newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted, if immensely troubled, musician - far more talented than his rival, the Dandy\&#39;s Courtney Taylor who narrates the picture. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Taylor\&#39;s Peter Fonda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even sadder, Taylor appears to realise this, evinced by his weary, self-loathing voice-over: he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost? In truth, they sold out, made Indie-Lite records, kept their teeth nice and clean, and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime - thus winning record contracts and a large tour bus. And jettisoning all credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in filth, is continually busted, beats up fellow band members on stage, kicks hecklers in the head - and is last glimpsed in Dig! being ferried away by police, having lost the right to see his child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the best films about rock\&#39;s subculture have been directed by women: Penelope Spheeris\&#39;s The Decline Of Western Civilization and this one \x96 an instant classic the moment it was released.&#39;,
   &#39;While Fred Schepisi\&#39;s &#34;I.Q.&#34; doesn\&#39;t really have any important qualities, it\&#39;s still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up looking like a French impressionist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate, but that\&#39;s not the point. It\&#39;s not intended as anything except a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins\&#39;s most famous movie from 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein\&#39;s whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.&#39;,
   &#34;The beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing , but sit tight, because you are in for the ride of your life. The concept is compelling, with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story. There are fine performances all around, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman&#39;s being the best of the cast-no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well. The Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The film has a Seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story, but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs. You will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Explosions,shootouts,bad guys and worse guys. It is fun to see James Belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss &#34;The Skipper. Does this sounds cheesy. Of course it is. But boy,did I have fun watching this movie. It is a whole lot better than all the direct to DVD garbage that is made nowadays. If you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store. You could argue about the twists being predictable. But the fast pace of this movie doesn\&#39;t give you time too think too much of them,which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist. But more about the journey to that moment. Only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie. They probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other. Pure fun!&#39;,
   &#34;Pinjar by Mr dwivedi is an awesome movie. Its definitely the greaest and finest of 2003. There are very good performances in it. Dwivedi knows what he can extract from MAST Urmila. she is like u have never seen before. one true great performance. along with her is a fine actor Manoj bajpai, who has shown bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The movie is about a girl(Urmila) living in Pre-partition pakistan. she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town. she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going-on-for-years kinda fight with the punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns as urmila&#39;s arranged marriage is due in few days. this movie is truly a very good movie. the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay. all the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (u wont believ but she can act as well besides jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. those sets with pre-partition pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score add to the positive points. from the start till the end u r stuck to u&#39;r seat with the question whats next? this movie is not jus worth watchin but deserved to be a part of your movie collection. the ultimate scene is the end of the movie. i would suggest all those No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai crowd to watch this amazing flick. my rating: 10/10.&#34;,
   &#34;Textbook example of an underestimated movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it, it&#39;s still regarded as just another funny picture. And although the movie has inspired many and added it&#39;s quotes and images to the pyche of all it&#39;s viewers, Moon Over Parador still hasn&#39;t received the acclaim it should. Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can&#39;t refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is timeless! In fifty years we will have the proof.&#34;,
   &#39;for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects, watch this movie! this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen. you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff.&#39;,
   &#39;When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city, apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death,it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later, &#34;The Woman in Green&#34; in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone)is similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals. Exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes. When will they learn you can\&#39;t cloud the minds of great fictional detectives ?&#39;,
   &#39;Forget that this is a &#34;B&#34; movie. Forget that it is in many ways outdated. Instead give writer-director Ida Lupino much deserved credit for addressing a subject which at the time (1950) was taboo in Hollywood. To my knowledge, this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and mental effects that that crime has upon its victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although much of the cast\&#39;s acting is pedestrian at best, Mala Powers, who at the time was eighteen or nineteen, gives an excellent performance throughout as the traumatized young woman, Ann, who tries to run away from her &#34;shame.&#34; Based on her work in this film, I\&#39;m surprised that she did not have a more successful acting career. Tod Andrews, too, has some fine moments as the minister who reaches out to help her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms Lupino, obviously working on a limited budget, was still able to create some memorable scenes such as the pursuit through the streets and alleys leading to the rape, and the police lineup following it. And, she created a bittersweet ending which left me wondering if Ann really could ever have a normal life again.&#39;,
   &#34;Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again. That is why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish High Schools. It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism. The American pilot who gets involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses for the democratically elected Republican Government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe ever made. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of a war (could anybody tell me the difference between Any war and a Civil war ?)is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. The cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again. A film like &#39;El viaje de Carol&#39;/ &#39;Carol&#39;s journey&#39; tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th Century. It is a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Again great work from the Peninsula Iberica !&#34;,
   &#39;Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in his directorial debut &#34;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&#34;, they starred together in this movie. George Clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project, that is in the same line with movie-remakes such as &#34;Ocean\&#39;s Eleven&#34; and &#34;The Italian Job&#34; but somehow this movie is only halve successful, or at least it isn\&#39;t as good as it could had been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop. Even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters, they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie. The fact that they are being played doesn\&#39;t change much to this, even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying, or anything like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s of course due to the writing that the characters aren\&#39;t used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian movie &#34;I Soliti ignoti&#34; works out much better than this movie does. The movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity. It\&#39;s an harmless little caper movie, in which you simply shouldn\&#39;t to worry much about the story. In that regard &#34;Welcome to Collinwood&#34; is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a movie that you won\&#39;t regret watching once you\&#39;ve finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#39;,
   &#39;When this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline &#34;Dirty Harry is at it again&#34;. Whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it\&#39;s complete and total accuracy. &#34;Sudden Impact&#34; retains all the aspects that made the previous three Dirty Harry movies so successful- tight pacing, a compelling plot, strong supporting characters, endless gunplay, and bone-dry humor. Some of these elements are not only retained but amplified- this is easily the darkest, bloodiest, and most overtly right-wing installment of the franchise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is somewhat intriguing: after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums, Inspector Callahan is sent on a forced &#34;vacation&#34; by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of San Paolo. He is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his (no doubt considerable) misery by a second shot to the head. Early on in the film, the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer- an artist named Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) who is hunting down the thugs who gang-raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier. This incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback, snippets of which recur before each new murder. As more bodies start to appear with the same M.O, it becomes clear to Harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest (guess who?) know more than they are telling. To make matters even more complicated, the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Sudden Impact&#34; offers relentless action from beginning to end. Clint Eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax. Sondra Locke\&#39;s performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character. That having been said, it is fair to wonder if another actress (who was not Eastwood\&#39;s off-screen companion at the time) could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role- Theresa Russell and Cybill Shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates. Members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include Albert Popwell as Harry\&#39;s partner Horace, Paul Drake as the psychopathic Mick, and the truly scene-stealing Audrie J. Neenan who portrays the vicious Ray Parkins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots (the animosity between Harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums, a Mob vendetta against him) take up too much screen time and don\&#39;t really have any bearing to the larger story. Their only real use is to raise the body-count to absurd levels. In the first half of the film it sometimes appears that Dirty Harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom. However the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat-and-mouse game between Callahan, Spencer, and her former tormentors assumes prominence. This second hour makes it clear that a more stripped-down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given &#34;Sudden Impact&#34; the potential to be a first-class, neo noir-style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough .44 magnum heroics to satisfy the Harry loyalists. Instead we get the film that Eastwood and Warner Bros. clearly wanted to make- a superbly executed but prototypical Eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it\&#39;s intended audience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box-office and it is not hard to see why. Though not the film that it could have been, this is still big, trigger-happy fun. Even after repeated viewings, it\&#39;s going to make your day.&#39;,
   &#39;Rupert Friend gives a performance, as Prince Albert, that lifts &#34;The Young Victoria&#34; to unexpected levels. He is superb. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after Prince Albert\&#39;s death and looking into Ruper Friend\&#39;s eyes I understood. The film doesn\&#39;t take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life. An act of love. I believed it, or I should say, him. I believed what he felt was real. Nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of Friend\&#39;s characterization. Emily Blunt is good but I didn\&#39;t believe for a minute she was Victoria. No real sense of period. It may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown.&#39;,
   &#34;Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you, but your gonna laugh. Probably enough to hurt your stomach. Sure it&#39;s got some blood splattering, all in good fun though. So, it&#39;s got no budget, who needs a budget when you got a script like this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the time and check this out. Well worth a two hour viewing. If everyone could laugh as much as I did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;Cunningly interesting Western from a director who had few peers in the genre. Much like other Anthony Mann pictures, The Far Country blends a potent pot boiling story with an adroit knowing of impacting scenery. Both of which play out amongst some of Mann\&#39;s peccadilloes like honour, integrity, betrayal and of course, death! The story sees fortune hunting partners Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} travel to Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. Aware of the blossoming gold-boom, they plan to make a tidy profit selling the cattle in a Klondike town. Arriving in Skagway they find self-appointed judge Mr. Gannon {John McIntire} ready to meet out justice to Webster on account of Webster having fractured the law, all be it with honest cause, along the way. In punishment Gannon takes the partners herd from them, but they steal them back and head across the Canadian border to Dawson-with Gannon and his men in hot pursuit. Here beautiful women and a meek and lawless town will fill out the destinies of all involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting from start to finish, The Far Country benefits greatly from James Stewart\&#39;s bubbling {anti} hero in waiting portrayal and Mann\&#39;s slick direction of the tight Borden Chase script. The cinematography from William H. Daniels is superlative, tho not done any favours by current DVD prints, and the film has a few surprises and a &#34;will he wont he?&#34; core reeling the viewers in. Paying dividends on re-watches for hardened genre fans, it still remains something of an essential viewing for first timers venturing into the wonderful, yet dark, Western world of Anthony Mann and James Stewart. 8/10&#39;,
   &#39;In Black Mask, Jet Li plays a bio-engineered super-killer turned pacifist, who has to fight against other super-killers. Bad plot, bad sfx(60 million dollar budget), but the fighting scenes were excellent! Jet Li is the greatest martial-arts star alive!&#39;,
   &#39;When I watched this film the first time, it was a taped copy and the title was/is Caged Terror. I still own the tape, and I confess, I\&#39;ve watched it more than once from beginning to end! The film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing! I have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we\&#39;ve had some great laughs from the terrible script. The film concerns a couple, (remember this is like early 70\&#39;s so they are just too hip man!) who go on a week-end camping trip in what I believe was supposed to be upstate NY. They have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it! The guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them, and he goes; &#34;And that\&#39;s beautiful man!&#34; Heavy man, really heavy! LOL! Anyway, along come a couple of Vietnam vets, one of who plays the flute, I believe. (At any rate they are musical fellows!) The guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly, they end up terrorizing them during the night. The guy ends up caged in a chicken coop, and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys. Actually, by the end of the night, she seems to be pretty into it, and when morning comes, the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave. Supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh! It never fails to amuse me anyway! If I could find this on DVD and replace my old tape copy, I\&#39;d actually buy it again, it\&#39;s classic camp! You gotta love this stuff!&#39;,
   &#39;I can\&#39;t believe John died! While filming an episode he collapsed on set! read this, (out of his biography online):John Ritter was Born In Burbank , Calafornia , On September 17th 1948. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He landed his last television role in &#34;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&#34; (2002), based on the popular book. On this sitcom, he played Paul Hennessey, a loving, yet rational dad, who laid down the ground rules for his three children. The show was a ratings winner in its first season and won a Peoples Choice Award for Best New Comedy and also won for Favorite Comedy Series by the Family Awards! While working &#34;8 Simple Rules&#34;, he also starred in his second-to-last film, Manhood (2003)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Same Year , While John Was Rehearsing for The 4th (3rd series) Episode of 8 Simple Rules (Now Shortened), he fell ill. Henry Winkler described it as &#34;John Looked Like He Had Food Poisoning&#34;.Then He collapsed on the Set, he was quickly rushed to a Nearby Hospital, The Same Burbank Hospital Where He Was Born ,he was diagnosed with an aorta dissection, an Unrecognized Heart Flaw, he Underwent Surgery but did not make it. John Ritter Died At Age 54 , just 1 Week Away from His 55th Birthday , leaving His Wife Amy Yasbeck and 4 Children.&#39;,
   &#34;THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon&#39;s most famous play about a TV newswriter named Felix Unger, who is an obsessive neat freak, who moves in with his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, a sportswriter and complete slob, after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it. Neil Simon&#39;s classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger. Matthau, fortunately, was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar, a one-of-a-kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout. This teaming of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re-visited in nine other films. With both of these actors no longer with us, the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious. Simon&#39;s play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed Felix&#39;s suicide attempt that is a winner. The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines, and David Sheiner as Oscar&#39;s poker playing buddies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters, blind dates of Oscar and Felix. Of course, it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there&#39;s nothing like the original. A joy from start to finish.&#34;,
   &#34;Too bad a couple of comments before me don&#39;t know the facts of this case. It is based on actual events, a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the Wilmington, DE/Philadelphia PA region from &#39;96 through 2000. I have to admit I was highly skeptical of how Hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and Philadelphia Inquirer news stories throughout the time period. Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress (who I really like in Cold Case) who played Fahey looked nothing like her (Anne Marie was actually prettier). I have to admit though that Mark Harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as Capano&#39;s and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period. Details of the case were right on...no deviations of dramatic effect...even down to the carpet, gun, furniture, and cooler. In conclusion, I also wanted to add that I have met Tom Carper many times at various functions (a good man, despite being a politician) and I am so glad that he pulled the strings in the Federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars.&#34;,
   &#39;Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It\&#39;s so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports the poor people in his country, can be held in such low esteem in the US. His worst &#34;sin&#34;, in my opinion, is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about that? I have always been fascinated by the US government+media reaction to Fidel Castro. At first, Castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supplanted Batista. Soon, however, Castro started turning the corporations in Cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats. We\&#39;re a decent country, but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? If these guys are &#34;dictators,&#34; then we could use more &#34;dictatorships&#34; especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.&#39;,
   &#39;Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this I was expecting a huge disappointment. Instead I got a film that perfectly portrays the irony, humor, elequence, and above all else the crushing sadness of Vonnegut\&#39;s novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly Nolte\&#39;s best preformance to date. He captures the defeat and selfloathing of Howard Cambell Jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alan Arkin is absolutly hilarious as George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as Cambell\&#39;s young lover. John Goodman is understated and more than effective as Cambell\&#39;s &#34;Blue Fairy Godmother.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Pinnocioesque story of Cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people. And aside from that, it is one of the most deeply romantic films I have ever come across. Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. And at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his Blue Fairy Godmother grants him his wish. And he realizes that...well, watch the movie and you\&#39;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made. It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.&#39;,
   &#39;I would love to comment on this film. Alas , my search has always endeth in vain. If any good citizen could help a desperate inhabitant of this ailing planet and restore his confidence in humanity by offering the whereabouts of either a UK VHS or loan him a DVD copy of the VHS; he would, without reservation, be eternally grateful..... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake wrote &#34;The road to excess is the path to wisdom&#34;, one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to fruition .... If not, I will have to replay the excellent Mr Russel\&#39;s Gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen Haunted Summer (for better or for worse) have enriched their viewing pleasure of the events of July 1816 whilst I, a fellow member of this melodious plot, rests his lonely case in solitude ...&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Show People&#34; is an absolutely delightful silent directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines. What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl, Peggy Pepper, whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying to make it on the big screen. Though she\&#39;s a success in comedy, what she wants to do is make &#34;art&#34; so she moves up to High Arts Studio. Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend Billy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many stars of the silent era have cameos in &#34;Show People,&#34; including Davies herself without the curly hair and makeup. I\&#39;m sure when people saw the film in 1928, they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene; sadly, nowadays, it\&#39;s not the case, even for film buffs. In one part of the film, however, she does meet Charlie Chaplin; in another, author Elinor Glyn is pointed out to her, and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film. Other stars who pop up in &#34;Show People&#34; are John Gilbert, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Leatrice Joy, Bess Flowers, Renee Adoree, Rod LaRoque, Aileen Pringle, and many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davies was adorable and a lively comedienne. It\&#39;s a shame William Haines quit the movies - he was cute and energetic, deservedly an enormous star back in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Show People&#34; is a simple story told in a witty way. It\&#39;s also a look back at an exciting era in Hollywood\&#39;s history and contains performances by two wonderful stars.&#39;,
   &#34;I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. Not as salacious as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) featuring Slovenian superstar philosopher/psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes, of the multi-talented Fiennes clan (she&#39;s sister to actors Ralph and Joseph).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this quite a bit, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested. Freudian and Lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours. It didn&#39;t help that an ill-advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real issue with this is that Zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with Freudian themes. He spends quite a bit of time on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, not exactly masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films, although that&#39;s really just me saying I&#39;d like to see part four and five and six.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zizek is very funny, and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he&#39;s discussing. So, for instance, we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds) or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel (from Psycho). Which is not to say that his theories are not provocative. Even when I found myself disagreeing with him, it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films. Which is exactly what he&#39;s trying to accomplish.&#34;,
   &#34;Directed by Govind Nihalani, this is definite cop film of Indian cinema. May be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force &amp; politics with no holds barred &amp; how it effects on a young cop. A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father. Agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop/bad cop Hindi films but this is different. Today&#39;s generation, which grown up watching dark &amp; realistic films like- &#39;Satya&#39;, &#39;Company&#39; may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making. The film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn&#39;t pay much attention to such kind of cinema &amp; yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class &amp; mass audience when it released. For Om Puri its first breakthrough in mainstream Hindi cinema &amp; he delivered a class performance as Inspector Velankar. Its more than cop character, he internalized a lot which is something original in acting. Watch his scenes with his father whom he hates &amp; Smita whom he loves. Smita Patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level. My God what a natural expressions she carried!!! Shafi Inamdar was truly a discovery for me &amp; he&#39;s a brilliant character actor if given a chance &amp; here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even Om. The movie is also a debut of a promising villain on Indian screen- Sadashiv Amrapurkar as &#39;Rama Shetty&#39;. It&#39;s another story that he didn&#39;t get such a meaty role &amp; almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of Dharmendra&#39;s B grade action films. Watch the scene where Om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father (played by Amrish Puri) &amp; next both are sharing wine together. How inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love &amp; hate for each other. Two faces of Indian Police Force- Masculinity &amp; Impotency and in between lies- half truth (ardh satya)\x85Kudos to Nihalani&#39;s touch. The film won 2 National Awards as Best Hindi Feature Film &amp; Best Actor- Om Puri &amp; 3 Filmfare Awards in Best Film, Best Director &amp; Best Supporting Actor Categories. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious Hindi films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings- 8/10&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;My child, my sister, dream &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How sweet all things would seem &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were we in that kind land to live together, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there love slow and long, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There love and die among &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those scenes that image you, that sumptuous weather.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Baudelaire &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, &#34;Enachanted April&#34; can be described in one sentence \x96 it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that &#34;Enchanted April&#34; - an ultimate &#34;feel good&#34; movie is perfection of its genre. Lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, &#34;Enchanted April&#34; is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of highest quality.&#39;,
   &#39;Well, What can I say, other than these people are Super in every way. I quite like Sharon Mcreedy, I enjoy this pure Nostalgic Series And I have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes, I did not realise that they had made so many, I also think that it is a great shame, that they have not made any more. I wish that I got given these powers, Imagine me, being knocked off my cycle, somewhere and being knocked out cold, then waking up in a special hospital. Later on, I discover that my body has been enhanced. Just like Richard Barrat. These stories are 50 Minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, You cannot fight these 3 people, as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry. The music is well written, and to me, puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind, The sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats, Improved sight, Improved hearing and touch. and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon. Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent. When I was a boy, I had a huge crush on her!!!! Now I can see why, on my DVD set. The box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series. I also thought that Trymane was a good boss, firm but he got things done!&#39;,
   &#39;This was one of those times when I had nothing to do with 27 premium movie channels available to me. The Theory of Flight grabbed me and held my interest. I found it both touching and amusing, a nice combination of feelings. I recommend it!&#39;,
   &#34;LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt I&#39;ll see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is set in the industrial wastelands of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) for him. To do this the son has to break the record opening doors. What the father actually wants his for his son to be someone, because he himself has never made it further as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironically called L&#39;Espoir (Hope). Of course nothing works out as planned. This film can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäki&#39;s DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and the humour is darker. Just like in that film however the tone is more melancholic than depressing and the ending upbeat, without being unrealistically happy. The humour is absurd, without making the plot unbelievable, and Mariage finds stunning images in the bleak settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the acting by Poelvoorde. This actor shot to fame with the also brilliant cult-classic C&#39;EST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then he only played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting capabilities and all the roles he was offered were reprises of the Ben character. With his return to a leading role in LCA there should be no doubt anymore about his acting. He&#39;s simply brilliant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery, but smart enough to realize what he&#39;s done and be torn by remorse about it. A must see.&#34;,
   &#34;For anyone who&#39;s judged others at first meeting, here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character. The grumpy old lady has a soft, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. The flighty, unsure, &#39;ditsy&#39; dame who makes inappropriate, uncomfortable comments - sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all. The cold, prim, proper, neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute - given the right setting. The perfect beauty - rich, sweet, partying, pursued by throngs - wants peace, quiet, and love without possessiveness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By taking the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasures in everyday life, from the least expected sources. All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment.&#34;,
   &#34;I thought it was one of the best sequels I have seen in a while. Sometimes I felt as though I would just want someone to die, Stanley&#39;s killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant. It was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died. My only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant movie.&#34;,
   &#34;If you like horror movies with lots of blood and gore, tons of jump-scare moments and unrelenting, escalating scenes of excruciating death, then look elsewhere. If you like quiet, moody, thoughtful horror which casts blood aside in favor of a genuine feeling of dread, then Wendigo is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughtful, stressed out George, his psychoanalyst wife Kim and their young son Miles are heading out to the snowy countryside for a long weekend vacation away from the city. On the way up, George hits a stag with his car. The hunters who had been pursuing the deer are not thrilled when they find that George has ended their chase. In particular, deranged hunter Otis takes it personally. He follows the family to their vacation home, making sure they see him. He spies on George and Kim as they have sex. He fires through their windows with his rifle when they aren&#39;t home, letting them discover the ominous holes in their windows and walls when they return. When Kim takes Miles to the drugstore in town, Miles is attracted to a small sculpture in a display case, carved to resemble a man with the head of a stag. A Native American man tells Miles that this is the Wendigo, a spirit of the woods who has a taste for flesh and is always hungry. Miles takes the figure home with him, already haunted by the death of the deer the day before. That afternoon, when he and his father go sledding, George is shot and Miles pursued through the woods by a creature barely glimpsed...or is he just in shock, and imagining the whole thing? Hours later, George is rushed to the hospital and Miles, still clutching his statue, either faints, dreams or goes on a vision quest, in which the Wendigo returns. This time the angry, flesh eating god - part tree, part stag and part man - is hunting for Otis, who has finally gone over the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendigo is a beautifully made film, almost totally silent but for the wind howling through the snow covered trees. Okay, so the monster itself is kind of fakey-looking, but it&#39;s a small flaw, more than made up for by the genuine feeling of tension and dread that creeps through every frame of the film, and the eerie backdrop of the silent, snowy countryside. The performances are great, particularly by Jake Weber as the moody and thoughtful George and Patricia Clarkson as his sweet but no-nonsense wife. They are a happy couple with their share of common problems, and it is the strength of their relationship and their love for each other that makes this film powerful. Watching this film is often like watching someone&#39;s home videos, so realistic are the performances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is not for everyone. A lot of people may find themselves totally bored, waiting for the hideous Lovecraftian Beast and bloody revenge that never come. We can never really be sure if the Wendigo even exists, seen as it is through the eyes of a sensitive child and also, later, through the eyes of a madman. This is more a psychological drama than a horror film, but it has more than enough creepy elements in it to satisfy fans of subtle horror.&#34;,
   &#39;I discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it. It is not a strictly biographical film; it is &#34;loosely based&#34; on the facts. But I found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness, and Michel Serrault gives an unforgettable performance as Dr. Petiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many memorable images in this movie; Petiot traveling through the night like a vampire, his black cloak flapping behind him, is almost iconic. There are also several touches of expressionism - Petiot\&#39;s crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation, reminds me of some scenes from \&#39;Nosferatu\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural. The soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds, starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits, accompanied by wordless wailing. Petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops, and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere, as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw. There are animal noises as well - the concierge keeps a goat, unseen cats howl - and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass. The whole atmosphere is unsettling, with overtones of violence and slaughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only animals, but human voices are often heard - the screams of Gestapo victims, Petiot\&#39;s patients in his waiting room, monitored by a listening device, just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells. Even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them - when Petiot goes to see Mme Kern, we hear her singing as she works, her voice echoing in the theater, before we ever see her. And even when she does appear, she is often filmed from behind, her voice calling out to her husband, whose voice calls out to her in conversation. Disembodied voices echo in large halls, and their owners, when seen at all, are photographed at a distance, so we cannot actually see them speaking. This is a ghost story, and these are the voices of ghosts - many of them Petiot\&#39;s future victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet Petiot himself is often only a voice; his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera, throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody. In a way, he is as much a ghost as those he murders. He is always frantically busy, scurrying from appointment to appointment, never at rest. But his activity is that of a machine - lifeless and imperturbable. It is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied Paris, Petiot alone is unafraid; he is amused, enthusiastic, angry, irritated, contemptuous, but never afraid, unlike those real people he lures to their deaths. It is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions, including a perpetual motion machine (a true detail from the book - he did claim to have invented many machines); he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself. And mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film, from the opening giant wheel in the movie house, to Petiot\&#39;s bicycle (with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives), to the Victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill. Even his routine with his victims is mechanical - write a note to your wife, let me disguise you before you leave, you need a vaccination, Barcelona, Casablanca, Dakar - like a well-oiled machine, the routine is always the same, just as the record is always the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maeder, the author, says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against Petiot at his trial. His system was as smooth and efficient as a Nazi concentration camp, and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of Petiot\&#39;s involvement with the French Gestapo and the occupying Nazis. Unfortunately, it doesn\&#39;t quite work as part of the story, because it\&#39;s very hard to figure out just what Petiot is doing for the collaborators, or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night. Disposing of bodies? Hiding stolen goods? It\&#39;s hard to say, and harder to believe; it\&#39;s not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like Petiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does remind us of the duality of evil people; Petiot is a robber and a murderer, but he is also a devoted father and husband. Just as we learned that Hitler loved dogs, and that Nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men, so we have to recognize that Petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally. His insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in Paris; when killing, robbing and disappearing are happening all around, nobody pays attention as Petiot tosses more corpses on the pile.&#39;,
   &#39;Garde à Vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains. If you\&#39;re not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, don\&#39;t even try to watch it. You\&#39;ll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garde à Vue is a wordy film, essentially based upon dialogs (written by Audiard by the way)and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? Because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation. His wife knows it, she\&#39;s jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still death penalty)rather than unveiling the sole &#34;pure and innocent&#34; aspect of his pitiful life.&#39;,
   &#34;When I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening, I was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it. I was sorry when I talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended. I, on the other hand, felt completely the opposite. I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else. People I talked to said there was too much talking! Plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters. I found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the American movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused. They also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings--happy OR sad. This disgusts me. Nobody wants to be challenged anymore??? And as for the ending (and I don&#39;t want to be a spoiler), I am totally content because I know in my heart that these two characters WILL see each other again. It&#39;s all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny. It&#39;s a very personal film that doesn&#39;t speak to all people. But it certainly spoke to me. Give it a chance! Be patient with it! Richard Linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna. Watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters. As if you yourself were tripping through Europe on a Eurail pass. It&#39;s very intimate. Plus, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life. They must have improvised during some parts and it works well. They have a great chemistry in their roles. Their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses. I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr. Linklater and I deeply respect him for getting this film made. It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much. Bravo for romance!!!&#34;,
   &#34;This film is a jolt of punk rock fun, from start to finish. The Ramones, reigning princes of late-70s Punk rock, appear as themselves. PJ Soles stars as Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock &#39;n roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school rockin&#39;, and encourages her fellow-students to join her in her jubilant antics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile the school that Riff attends, has just hired a brand-new Principal, named Ms. Togar. She&#39;s a tall, intimidating Amazon of a woman. And she vows to make the students &#39;toe-the-line&#39;. She even has a couple of the students act as monitors, who report back to her with dirt on their classmates. Ms. Togar is especially determined to nab Riff, and put a stop to Riff&#39;s anarchic shenanigans. But Riff has clever ways to foil Togar, at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the superb performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary B movie actress. And in this film, she plays the fascist Ms. Togar, with sneering relish. PJ Soles as Riff, turns in an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as the duplicitous Eaglebauer, has lots of fun with his role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential, in the 70s Punk rock scene. Certainly, this is a good film for Ramones fans. But even if you&#39;re not into the Ramones, or Punk rock, this movie is a terrific blast (literally) of energetic fun.&#34;,
   &#34;Well, this film is a difficult one really. To be straight with you, this film doesn&#39;t contain much of a riveting story, nore does it make u &#39;want&#39; to know how it&#39;ll end...but I&#39;ll tell you something now...never have I been as tense and jumped up before in my life! This film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills! To be fair, I did watch it at almost midnight so I was kinda sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why I was jumpy...or maybe it&#39;s because this film does deliver in that aspect! It&#39;s basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. They decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains...all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (i think it&#39;s it&#39;s the sister of the main character, and she brings along her husband)...during the night, the husband hears noises...checks it out, and thats when things start to go really really wrong...they don&#39;t stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn&#39;t right...to cut a long story short...eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not a Hollywood blockbuster, nore does it have a huge budget, but please don&#39;t let that put you off. It&#39;s creepy, tense and very very jumpy! Just give it a try :)&#34;,
   &#34;Who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching? I am really impressed. It&#39;s a shame that more people have not seen it. I loved, as always, Hans Zimmer&#39;s score. And what a directorial debut by Bernard Rose! Yet I wonder if I should call this a horror film. It could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well. Well, regardless, I love the interpretive potential it has. Everything and everyone in Anna&#39;s (played by Charlotte Burke)dreams represents a real conflict in her life...the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. It is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings. I hope I come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon.&#34;,
   &#34;Joshua Seftel&#39;s first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is about just as the title suggests: The corporations effect on War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is about a mercenary (John Cusack) traveling to Turaqistan (not a real country, fyi) to help the American government &#39;get their message across&#39; to Turaqistan&#39;s leaders. He meets a reporter (Marisa Tomei) and we all know what will ensue with a lonely man + a hot reporter. Somewhere in the mix, a pop star named Yonica Babyyeah gets thrown in. As Yonica is marrying one of Turaquistan&#39;s most important people (a son of the president), a subplot is created where the mercenary must watch over this star, well, somewhat. The film starts off with a lonely Cusack in a bar; no more than fifteen seconds later, the film hooks you. With it&#39;s amusing and intriguing insight on terrorism and politics, the film&#39;s running time blows by you. The film has a lot more action than I expected, with the occasional scene of war, well choreographed fights and just sporadic scenes of murder. Though the story isn&#39;t much deep, the simplicity of it all makes the film perfect for both the common man and movie critics alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final act of the film, the simplicity of it all turns very hostile and jumbled. I thought it was executed very well, but other may disagree, and I could understand why. Twist after twist is what the ending is all about, and like most films, it is a true hit/miss situation. Regardless, the three writers on the film (Mark Leyner, Jeremy Pikser &amp; John Cusack) did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire on today&#39;s situation overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joshua Seftel does an excellent job insuring the film&#39;s integrity; not reducing the material to the most redundant of films (which I was afraid would happen). Seftel crafted the film as perfectly as one could: he created a vibrant atmosphere, one that is both examines harsh reality and cartoonish falsities; - contrasting them perfectly - as well as making the film feel as if you were watching it all. Seftel really gets you involved in all of the action and it pays off completely. No missteps here. Hopefully, he takes on more directorial jobs, for he is one director to look out for.&#34;,
   &#34;This is the second film I&#39;ve seen of Ida Lupino as a director after 53&#39;s the hitch-hiker. I think this one was a better film then that one. This one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doesn&#39;t like everyone looking and talking about her so she runs away and and is taken in by a family. I think Leonard Maltin&#39;s review is right only to give it 2 and 1/2 stars.&#34;,
   &#39;Part Two picks up... not where the last film left off. As part of the quasi-conventionality of Steven Soderbergh\&#39;s epic 4+ hour event, Che\&#39;s two stories are told as classic &#34;Rise&#34; and &#34;Fall&#34; scenarios. In Part Two, Che Guevara, leaving his post as a bureaucrat in Cuba and after a failed attempt in the Congo (only in passing mentioned in the film), goes down to Bolivia to try and start up another through-the-jungle style revolution. Things don\&#39;t go quite as well planned, at all, probably because of Che\&#39;s then notorious stature as a Communist and revolutionary, and in part because of America\&#39;s involvement on the side of the Bolivian Government, and, of course, that Castro wasn\&#39;t really around as a back-up for Che.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it goes, the second part of Che is sadder, but in some ways wiser than the first part. Which makes sense, as Guevara has to endure low morale from his men, betrayals from those around him, constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants, and by ultimately the enclosing, larger military force. But what\&#39;s sadder still is that Guevara, no matter what, won\&#39;t give in. One may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw- maybe both- but it\&#39;s also clear how one starts to see Che, if not totally more fully rounded, then as something of a more sympathetic character. True, he did kill, and executed, and felt justified all the way. And yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity; the sequence where Guevara\&#39;s health worsens without medicine, leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse, marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, Soderbergh\&#39;s command of narrative is strong, if, on occasion, slightly sluggish (understandable due to the big running time), and one or two scenes just feel totally odd (Matt Damon?), but these are minor liabilities. Going this time for the straight color camera approach, this is almost like a pure militia-style war picture, told with a great deal of care for the men in the group, as well as Guevara as the Lord-over this group, and how things dwindle down the final scene. And as always, Del-Toro is at the top of his game, in every scene, every beat knowing this guy so well- for better and for worse- that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible. Overall, the two parts of Che make up an impressive package: history as drama in compelling style, good for an audience even if they don\&#39;t know Che or, better, if they don\&#39;t think highly of him. It\&#39;s that special. 8.5/10&#39;,
   &#34;The star of this film is the screenplay. Attention to detail for the period in dress, language ,social mores ( we don&#39;t hurt women) and the politics are remarkable. It is a reminder of Kosovo to-day. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb. Perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received. It is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step. A great film....&#34;,
   &#39;I can give you four reasons to see this movie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Four good stories, related into a big scheme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A surprisingly good cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. A bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country (and many others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Antonio Serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the Italian neorealism with a &#34;Peter and the wolf&#34;-like anecdote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the third story, the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context, Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment. But after the recent lynching at Tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the State of Mexico, this story couldn\&#39;t be more updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor in the &#34;grand finale&#34; in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed. Reprising the center scene from one of his previous films &#34;Todo el poder&#34;, Sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme. And by the way, give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti making a brief striptease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the movie has ended, you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie (and maybe enjoyed it) with a very painful subject. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example. This film is a testimony of how Mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime state(and perhaps accepted it), between two fires: The criminals and the so-called authorities full of corruption. Even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they don\&#39;t get this unhurt. If you had an assault without a scratch then you\&#39;re lucky. Meanwhile, don\&#39;t lose the chance to see this movie, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it\&#39;s a beautiful life in Mexico...&#39;,
   &#39;I was not only an extra in this movie, I got to see it in Boston to a sold out cinema. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans jammed themselves into a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy....about them....Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust. The love is between the two young lovers. The lust is for the Red Sox winning the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He is funny enough and gets the most laughs. Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore. At times, I felt supporting actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role. All in all, all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.&#39;,
   &#34;I saw this film without to know what about were... I&#39;m a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare&#39; films, and, in the beginning, I saw it only for this... and I finished with tears in my eyes, because the great, great serenity, values, affect and brave philosophy about Life of Helena&#39;s girl. Recommended to people who are bored with TV programming (in Spain, at least).&#34;,
   &#39;Like &#34;My Sassy Girl&#34;, this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet, but that\&#39;s where the similarities end. The story is generally about this rebellious guy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a tutor named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from a poor background, but happens to be the same age as him. Add to that some obstacles, martial arts (thugs are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge), a scorned, thuggish love-sick girl who is after him, his proclivity for ditching the lessons, and you generally can guess the whole story. Did I mention it\&#39;s a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fight scenes, great visual humor and a lot of spunk, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, that bring a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work because of that reason. And, I must say, I\&#39;d want a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from &#34;My Sassy Girl&#34; (personality-wise, at least). She has some spunk, but it\&#39;s more on the cute, sweet, good-hearted way. Characters are already mostly likable (so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than &#34;My Sassy Girl&#34;--an obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit), and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way. The story kind of sags, though, about 2/3 of the way (where it sort of treads on familiar, standard fare, where nothing really interesting happens), but near the end, it picks up a bit again. Overall, a fun, cute movie. 8/10&#39;,
   &#34;Laurence Fishburne is a fine actor, and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in a class with the great Shakespeareans like Olivier and Welles; and he further suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, cleanly steals the show away. Olivier recognized that potential in his production, and cast Iago with someone he knew he could upstage. I didn&#39;t nearly realize the possibilities of Iago, Shakespeare&#39;s most evil character, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see the views of Venice, too.&#34;,
   &#39;Story about four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most level-headed of the bunch--but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she\&#39;s more mature than the rest of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nothing new from what we\&#39;ve seen plenty of times before--but this one has one big difference--it\&#39;s accurate. I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the film) and I was surprised at how realistic it was. They got the dialogue, clothes and attitudes down completely right. Even the main song of the movie (&#34;On the Radio&#34; by Donna Summer) was a big hit before this came out. This film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew girls in high school who were just like this! The film is (of course) dated but it captures a time we will never see again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is good on all counts with Foster giving the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well-done. Even Scott Baio (who has a small role as a friend of the girls) more or less realistically played a teen boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good movie--essential viewing if you came of age in 1980. The film has a deserved R rating (plenty of drug use and swearing) but should be seen by all teens. I give it a 8.&#39;,
   &#34;Tess of the Storm Country was a Mary Pickford vehicle I had intended to get for some time. I finally found a VHS copy for a reasonable price and got to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary gives her typical spunky, innocently sexy portrayal of a wrong-side-of-tracks girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time the stakes are higher: a false murder charge, an illegitimate child (and ensuing case of mistaken motherhood) and contemplated suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can see why Pickford wanted to redo this one. The story is a real morality tale, the kind that she loved to star in. The controversial topics aren&#39;t always spelled out plainly; a viewer has to pay attention and pick up on hints to catch everything that is being implied on first viewing \x96 although everything is more or less explained in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only negative remark I can make would be concerning Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, looks to be about 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger next to Mary, of course!), is sent fleeing in panic when a 60-pound chocolate lab charges toward him! Then, to top it off (or maybe to justify his perplexing fear of the dog), it manages to pin him to the ground and somehow injures him so badly that he is still struggling to get up much later, as a bad storm hits! This is the same lovable lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and cuddles with Mary! Yet Mary later throws boiling water in Ben&#39;s face, which barely slows him! OK, I&#39;ve vented about Ben and the chocolate lab! Other than that, the movie was quite touching and certainly held my attention. Pickford&#39;s supporting cast was strong and believable. This is certainly among her better films.&#34;,
   &#39;This game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fighting is basic, not to hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather fun. You get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city. However, that is also a weak point. The swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as Spider-man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky. You also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. Still, it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for one wild action packed ride.&#39;,
   &#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re at all interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans/early 19th century American history, or Yul Brynner, see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it. Don\&#39;t be put off by various lacklustre reviews. My reaction to it was that it is entertaining, well acted (for the most part), has some very witty dialogue, and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer Jean Lafitte. While not all the events in the film are historically accurate (can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this?), I feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role Lafitte played in New Orleans\&#39; history, and the love-hate relationship between the &#34;respectable&#34; citizens of New Orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city\&#39;s favorite sons. Don\&#39;t worry about what the film doesn\&#39;t do, but watch it for what it does do, i.e., for its study of one of New Orleans\&#39;, and America\&#39;s, most intriguing historical figures.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Dance, Fools, Dance&#34; is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan, a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties, booze, and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming. This all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) penniless. Bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name Mary Smith; her brother goes to work for bootleggers. The head man is Jake Luva - portrayed by Clark Gable as he plays yet another crook. Later, of course, he would turn into a romantic hero, but in the early \&#39;30s, MGM used him as a bad guy. Not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity, Bonnie cozies up to Luva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gable and Crawford made a great team. Her facial expressions are a little on the wild side, but that, along with her dancing, is one of the things that makes the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, as Bert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s always interesting to see the precode movies, and &#34;Dance, Fools, Dance&#34; is no exception.&#39;,
   &#39;I havent seen that movie in 20 or more years but I remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas-masks vividly, this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on Saving private Ryan, I recommend it strongly.&#39;,
   &#39;One of the more sensible comedies to hit the Hindi film screens. A remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 60s Hollywoon hit of the same name, Garam Masala elevates the standard of comedies in Hindi Cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Akshay Kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of Hindi cinema who can do comedy. He has combined well with the new hunk John Abraham. However John still remains in Akshays shadows and fails to rise to the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new gals are cute and do complete justice to their roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must watch comedy. Leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs!!!! After all laughter is the best medicine ! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!&#39;,
   &#39;This film, in my opinion, is, despite it\&#39;s flaws (which I maintain are *few*), an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Mr. Bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films. He does not receive 1/100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience. If it were not for Mr. Bakshi, I don\&#39;t believe animation would have survived the Disney onslaught. What is more, with The Lord of the Rings, he has not only created a beautiful animated film, but he has created an entirely new art form - unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film (the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation). But I feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm. No, this is not Disney animation. No it\&#39;s not live action. No, it\&#39;s not &#34;cheating&#34; - what it is is a new, fascinating, and absolutely wonderful art form. Something so fresh, and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34;. Bakshi\&#39;s pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of Middle Earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way, in particular, the darker of Tolkien\&#39;s creatures, particularly the Nazgul, are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter S. Beagle\&#39;s screenplay (based very little, as I understand it, on an early draft by Chris Conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkien\&#39;s works. Where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which Bakshi has created. There are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film, but there are very few changes to the storyline. There are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled: The reforging of Narsil, the gifts of Galadriel, the Huorns at the battle of the Hornburg, but, again, with the time limitations he had (already the longest animated feature in history), these are certainly understandable (though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also there is the delightful (one of my favorites) score by Leonard Rosenman (who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (the score for which is clearly based on his LotR work)). It is bombastic and audacious and, dare I say, perfect. It stands on it\&#39;s own as an orchestral triumph, but when coupled with the images of the film, it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection. So far from the typical Hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The voice actors are wonderful. Of particular note is John Hurt as Aragorn who just oozes the essence of Strider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The character design is also wonderfully unique, though not often to everyone\&#39;s taste. But remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he/she imagines, not what you might have imagined, and so Aragorn is realized with a distinctive Native American feel and Boromir appears in Viking inspired garb. This is perhaps not what you imagined, but I can only applaud Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he &#34;saw&#34;. It also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One farther word - the Flight to the Ford sequence, in my opinion, is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment, and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build. Bakshi\&#39;s artistic ability and Tolkien\&#39;s incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recent DVD release (2001) by Warner Brothers, is sorely lacking. While we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package is woefully short of extras. How glorious it would have been to have had a director\&#39;s commentary, been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release. Another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over. Also present in the DVD release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film. This version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made. We will never be able to see Bakshi\&#39;s interpretation of Gondor, of Shelob, of Faramir, of the Cracks of Doom, of Eowyn\&#39;s battle with the Witch King or Gandalf\&#39;s confrontation with him. We will never be graced with Bakshi\&#39;s image of Denethor or the Palatir or the Paths of the Dead. It is a shame beyond all shames that we will, in the end, have to accept Peter Jackson\&#39;s glitz and glitter Hollywood, action film version of these later events in Tolkien\&#39;s masterpiece, but, I suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David&#39;,
   &#34;As in Amelie, recent French films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant, centered on a female finding her one true love. In this case, desperation leads to a convict, which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype. Clever and surprising story in many ways, except that the female is there to support the male.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us that don&#39;t speak French, the subtitles are a little quick, but not unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soundtrack, as seems to be increasingly the case with European films, is great and in perfect sync with the film&#39;s variations. Nothing seems forced. Visually, it reminds me of various urban horror movies. There&#39;s a Wes Craven in Chicago feel to it.&#34;,
   &#39;I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh. Neither did How to lose friends and Alienate People.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off. However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous. But in the end he ends up doing them, the culture of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is well toned with humor, romance, good acting and also a bit of a lap dance. Its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends.&#39;,
   &#39;You can debate Prince\&#39;s acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this film. There is no debate about his musical talent either then or now. He seems like a shadowy has-been twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in\&#39;85) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time. From Tipper Gore (Al\&#39;s wife) trying to censor &#34;Little Nikki&#34; and every thing else under the sun via the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) to every &#34;Air Band&#34; at the time impersonating Prince, it was the absolute hottest thing out. For a few weeks at least, Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered. It didn\&#39;t disappoint. EVERYONE was caught up. I was an MTV junkie at the time(they actually played music then....all the time)Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I must qualify this commentary by saying that, at that time, my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Flock of Seagulls and others in the Punk/ New Wave genre\&#39; The music of Prince at the time transcended all types and styles. One of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was SOOOOOOOO big then. All the things that remind you of the 80\&#39;s were iconic then. It was mainstream and it seems like a cliché\&#39; now. It got so popular that it became ridiculous. It\&#39;s like the rappin\&#39; Granny commercial for Wendy\&#39;s Hamburgers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks stupid now because EVERYONE was caught up in it (sadly, kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something. Anyway, I hope this gave you all a little insight.&#39;,
   &#39;I love this anime! I was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence (mostly from Akane Ranma\&#39;s reluctant but short tempered &#34;fiancee&#34;)is so slapstick however Ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends...clumsily. The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the cursed Jusenkkyo Spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water. From then on it\&#39;s pure chaos one after another. Among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy Shampoo, the pervert Happosai all causing trouble for our hero/heroine. However it is Ranma\&#39;s selfish father Genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time. If anyone want an anime that\&#39;s funny, this is the one. It\&#39;s cuter and better with the Japanese dub.&#39;,
   &#34;I have to say that this was not very exciting but talk about fashion and weird ways to solve a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb... that&#39;s fantastic! I really liked about that part of the movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corky (Josh Flitter) is however extremely hilarious... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) seemed really hopeless... he should have been more angry with her for how she has treated him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, this movie is tour and fashion in disguise. Anyhow, I recommend this movie, just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teen spy movies by Emma Roberts.. Spymate... remember? She&#39;s becoming good at this tricky detective work.&#34;,
   &#34;I am a VERY big Jim Carrey fan. I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also like him in his serious movies, especially Truman Show. This one is a cross between his VERY funny side, and his serious side. He is of course VERY funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious, and he pulls it off with a lot of ease. he is truely a multi-function actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Aniston&#39;s acting. I think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass. Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God. As for Steven Carell, his limited scenes are VERY funny, especially in the anchor scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would have to rate this a 9. Good acting, funny script, and some very serious situations make this a very good film.&#34;,
   &#39;What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was realized! This is the first filmed version of \&#39;Hamlet\&#39; to use the full text of Shakespeare\&#39;s play, but Branagh didn\&#39;t do it just because &#34;it was there.&#34; His intention, I believe, was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down, so to speak. In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves, a fair enough proposition and one that\&#39;s a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well, it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself. The production design and cinematography and both outstanding, which helps immensely when you\&#39;re watching a four-hour movie. Branagh\&#39;s casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise. The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play. Since so much of \&#39;Hamlet\&#39; is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels, battles, etc., this can be a daunting task. But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor/writer/directors, if not always the best, since he made his big splash with \&#39;Henry V.\&#39; One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times. In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again, but there is a method at work. Let\&#39;s face it, \&#39;Hamlet\&#39; is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before, he or she needs help even if they\&#39;ve read the play. Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film, even if you don\&#39;t know the literal meaning of every arcane word. This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many other outstanding performances here they\&#39;re almost too numerous to mention, but some of them must be acknowledged. Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise. Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling, made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time! She looks to me like the finest young actress around. Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, Michael Maloney, and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz, respectively. Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie, Charlton Heston, and Robin Williams, who manages to do his thing here successfully. Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works. The one cast member who doesn\&#39;t, inexplicably, is Jack Lemmon. In the very opening scene he appears, and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood, Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor. You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh, since everything else about the movies screams out that it\&#39;s the work of a perfectionist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie, but it does seem just a tad too long. Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit, if I may be so bold, and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I forget anything, other than Patrick Doyle\&#39;s score? No doubt I did. I\&#39;ll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of \&#39;Hamlet,\&#39; and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one.&#39;,
   &#34;This film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film (along the lines of Tales from the Crypt) written by Robert Bloch (author of Psycho). It&#39;s good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast. The movie should also be required viewing for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee (the third Doctor) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star!&#34;,
   &#39;This film is shockingly underrated on IMDb. Like so many films, this isn\&#39;t Shawshank. But it\&#39;s a reasonably good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer, than I think you\&#39;ll like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from the IMDb ratings, my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250, and was &#34;vote bombed&#34; with many 1s, as happens to so many films that aren\&#39;t about the mob, don\&#39;t have special effects, or include non-white or non-straight characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s an American film, but it\&#39;s not a US film. Set mostly in Toronto the cues are subtle, and some audiences may think it\&#39;s set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the music. I liked the dance (but not convinced it\&#39;s worth $50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree the title sucks. I don\&#39;t remember anyone in the film saying those words, and it should have an &#34;s&#34;. (No, it\&#39;s not a foreign language).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s not a lot to hate about this film (and let\&#39;s be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume that it\&#39;s an expression of hate for the kind of people in it, and that\&#39;s sad.&#39;,
   &#39;Hollow Point, though clumsy in places, manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary entertainment value here is humor - everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie...&#39;,
   &#34;my name is Heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on. I want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it. as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were, it didn&#39;t really even come close to describing how bad things actually were. not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister. thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had,i truly appreciate them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Heather&#39;s mom. It&#39;s hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made. Harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. For any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation, please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you.&#34;,
   &#39;Not as bad a film as i thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good cast.Nice to see Roger Moore back on screen as well as the use of other British actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects.Maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy Maryam D`Abo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a good use of unseen locations such as Luxembourg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully we will see more UK-European co-productions like this.&#39;,
   &#39;this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like. most movies show jesus as being effeminate, lobotomized, or tortured. this jesus laughed, played, and was serious when it was necessary. this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to, not the usually hollywood version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the movie took some liberties, attempting to &#34;fill in the blanks.&#34; but the fillers didn\&#39;t seem impossible, or even improbable. one thing i might argue, was that it never really explained what the romans had against jesus (movie portrayed that the romans were the main driver of jesus\&#39; death, not that the jewish authorities were against the idea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it seemed that the movie was researched well. one example was the offhand comment to a teenage boy who was called &#34;mark.&#34; it is believed that mark (or john mark) was the boy referred to at the garden of gethsemane whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked (mark 14:51). i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate (even in spirit) was much as possible.&#39;,
   &#34;Great fun. I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film. We came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie. In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this &#39;malinski&#39; and &#39;bellini&#39; stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get funnier and funnier. In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next. Until half of the film was over we didn&#39;t even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had a good time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think about half of them didn&#39;t like it and the other half loved the film. If you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it. Apart from Clooney This movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, but when more ppl have seen it I am sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable I guess, I would give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;It takes a little while to get used to Nick Nolte\&#39;s Nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. Once you get past the bar, it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nolte, an American, moves to Germany, marries a famous actress, and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out. He\&#39;s visited by a jovial American, John Goodman, who persuades him to accept a post as an anti-Semitic radio broadcaster for the Nazis. Nolte has no politics but thinks it\&#39;s a challenge to write a role that\&#39;s almost impossible and then play it himself. Another American secret agent will modify Nolte\&#39;s radio scripts -- inserting a cough here, a sneeze there -- that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the Allies. There\&#39;s a catch, though. Nobody will know about Nolte\&#39;s real role as an American agent except Goodman, Donovan, and Roosevelt himself. If he\&#39;s ever uncovered, he\&#39;ll be refused recognition by the Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in Germany. His adored wife, Sheryl Lee, knows nothing of what\&#39;s going on, nor does she care. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as &#34;a nation of two.&#34; The war ends and the trouble begins. He\&#39;s captured by Americans who are bitter because of his betrayal. They beat him and leave him in the mud. He\&#39;s rescued by Goodman, his &#34;fairy godmother&#34;, who sends him to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sends him a little cash now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1960, he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor, the painter Alan Arkin, who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood. But his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient Aryan racists -- led by a dentist and a priest. His house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. He\&#39;s beaten senseless by an ex-GI. But -- miraculously -- his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient Aryans. Another catch: it turns out later that it\&#39;s not his wife, but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending has him typing his memoirs in an Israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity. It\&#39;s not a happy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nolte can talk with, but not see, the occupant of the cell above his in jail. It\&#39;s Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann seems pleasant enough. He advises Nolte that it\&#39;s a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours. &#34;It\&#39;s important to relax. You must learn to relax.&#34; Nolte laughs out loud and shouts, &#34;That\&#39;s how I GOT here.&#34; The film is filled with such ironies. At one point in their relaxed conversations, Arkin tells him that &#34;in spite of everything I still think people are good at heart.&#34; I don\&#39;t know if the movie was a commercial success but if it wasn\&#39;t, that\&#39;s the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater-goers who may never have heard of Anne Frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that it\&#39;s a movie for adults, and patient adults at that. The story moves slowly, there\&#39;s very little violence, no car chases, no shootings, and people don\&#39;t seem subject to manic speech pressure. A lot of it will probably slip past viewers who don\&#39;t open themselves to its deliberate approach. Nolte refers to the war-time relationship between him and his wife as &#34;a nation of two.&#34; This is a pretty compact phrase. No doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a story of a man who loses everything -- his ability to write, his identity, his wife (twice), his sole friend, his country, his self respect. At one point he stops walking along a crowded New York street and simply stands there until after dark, when he is moved along by a curious cop. The reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go. What Vonnegut is describing is far more than depression. I don\&#39;t mean to sound condescending but it\&#39;s the sort of feeling that\&#39;s hard to understand in your youth. Adolescents might like to THINK they know what\&#39;s holding Nolte in that one spot, but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Robert Frost\&#39;s line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in? Well no place will take Nolte in.&#39;,
   &#34;This has got to be one of my very favorite Twilight Zone episodes, primarily for the portrayal of two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cobweb-strewn shops and rubble-laden streets are eerie in that particular way the Twilight Zone does best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the parable can be a bit heavy-handed by today&#39;s drama standards, it is an excellent one - using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience, as well as geopolitics, in a way that is timeless. The entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of Mr. Bronson and Ms. Montgomery, who do not disappoint. (May they both rest in peace.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true classic.&#34;,
   &#34;When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience. For it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press, and the whole thing turns into a circus. Lindy doesn&#39;t help matters either because she won&#39;t play to the jury or courtroom, she&#39;s only herself, and she&#39;s a tough nut to crack, so of course everyone thinks she&#39;s guilty because there&#39;s a piece of evidence that hasn&#39;t come to light. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a Seventh-Day adventist pastor, who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife. It&#39;s good (or bad) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the States too, because the Australian public doesn&#39;t believe the story and the media only fans the flames. Eventually, Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor, but years later, a missing piece of evidence shows up and she&#39;s freed, but not until after the family&#39;s life is basically ruined. A heart-breaking story, very well done, a bit long but well worth seeing. 8 out of 10.&#34;,
   &#34;For Romance&#39;s sake, as a married man. The following two films are recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. And it happened! How she longed to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both movies, from great directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was so intense, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts. That leaves you with a great after-taste, sniffing it intensely without biting it.&#34;,
   &#39;This could be the most underrated movie of its genre. I don\&#39;t remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn\&#39;t do so well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie. I rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself &#34;God\&#39;s hand&#34;. And then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case. During that trip, the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims that he has received a divine message from God asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. The tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) get killed and religious experiences are questioned. It has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I own the DVD and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers.&#39;,
   &#34;Rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to Planet Earth... Of *course* Planet Earth is better - it has much much more of the same. Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series, and as such, is inevitably inferior and simplified. But that is not comparing like with like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a feature-length documentary (or actually as a feature-length anything), it surpasses pretty much anything you will see in your entire life (unless you choose to traverse the Earth in helicopters with long-range cameras for years on end, and wait for months in the most extreme environments to catch a glimpse of the most extraordinary beings on earth, which - lets face it - is unlikely).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the narration: yes everyone in the UK - very much including me - adores David Attenborough, and there&#39;s little excuse for him not to be narrating here, but that hardly deserves knocking down a star or three. He wasn&#39;t a presenter on Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s modest and gracious enough to realise that anything that gets more viewers in is a Good Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who sees this will be overwhelmed by its awe, majesty and glory. All reviewers agree on that. Those who love it (ie. everyone) will/should go on to see an buy Planet Earth. So three cheers for its cinematic release, and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy this on DVD rather than the Planet Earth box-set. But as works of art they&#39;re not in competition here people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Earth is big enough for both.&#34;,
   &#39;Fox\&#39;s epic telling of one a America\&#39;s greatest pioneering efforts comes to DVD with some truly outstanding &#34;Extras&#34;. BRIGHAM YOUNG (The &#34;Frontiersman&#34; was added for the European release), telling the story the great pioneer leader, who under inspiration brought members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)out to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, after mobs murdered their prophet/leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price), was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America was about to enter World War II. It was a daring move on Fox chief, Darryl F. Zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air to the Mormon people, as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen. Now Fox, working with James D\&#39;Arc, curator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought this film to the DVD format in an outstading edition. Mr. D\&#39;Arc, who some years ago did his doctoral dissertation on the film, has provided one of the most in depth commentary tracks ever done for a DVD. He seperates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why this films was so much appreciated by Church Leaders even though embellishments to the truth run throughout the film. One of the fun bits of information deals with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film he married a Latter-saint woman and was eventually converted to the LDS faith. There is much to be learned from D\&#39;Arc\&#39;s knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the DVD! There are over 100 pictures from the Fox &amp; BYU Archives included on the disc, plus newsreel footage of the incredible premiere at seven theatres in Salt Lake City. Thanks FOX for another outstanding DVD -- and thank you, James D\&#39;Arc for your great commentary!&#39;,
   &#39;And look how a true story, &#34;... with a little help of it\&#39;s friends...&#34; : a welldone and touching script, a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of &#34;no-name&#34; actors, especially from the 4-yr-old Jodelle Ferland, becomes a must seen movie. 9/10&#39;,
   &#39;Green Eyes is a great movie. In todays context of supporting our troops, it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty, during this period. From a historical view, the end of the Vietnam war left all of us with something to remember and learn from. Gene was very proud of this movie, and he deserved the credits he received from writing &#34;Green Eyes&#34;. I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, or at all. This movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on TV every year, much like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving. I was a friend of Gene Logans and I was proud to know him. Rocky&#39;,
   &#39;I loved this film. Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his &#34;boundless enthusiasm&#34; and acknowledge his shortcomings. His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain. I hoped, and was delighted to find, that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life, rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise. From beginning to end, this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology, leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to Ed Wood Jr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we get are people who knew Ed Wood the best talking about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Ed\&#39;s. We get insight into Ed\&#39;s personal and professional life: from his romances, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his film making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful (sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the President). The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems (&#34;Crossroads of Lorado&#34; and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him (for better or worse), to the point where one woman will go down in history as &#34;Swimming Pool Owner&#34; for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool. This ability to define a person\&#39;s legacy comes through universally, as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created. Somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the title hints at the B-list horror genre, but by the end, we see that even this is a kindness. What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with Wood\&#39;s legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many ways a living contradiction, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint. This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get. Being itself a juxtaposition of themes, it is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling.&#39;,
   &#39;This series could very well be the best Britcom ever, and that is saying a great deal, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbours, to name just two).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made Butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it did not just exemplify great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but it also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in Britain at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it. The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself. This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in North America at the time. Then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. These people - even the layabout sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. They were examples of the &#34;New Europeans&#34; that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (1980s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary, particularly to North Americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was depicted in American movies and TV, but not with the intensity of Butterflies or the movie Montenegro). And, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. A potential affair that was not really about sex, or even romance? Butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief... at the time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic. It documented, ahead of its time - post-modern ennui, all-pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships). It is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way, and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place, and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come.&#39;,
   &#39;Classic drama/action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of it\&#39;s time(1954). The production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and love.Unique peek into the American NORTHT WEST pioneers is very educational and entertaining.This movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many &#34;lawmen&#34; during this particular time and place were very crooked/corrupt much like most developing countries today.The action sequences could have been more realistic though but still,this movie really covers most of the essentials.Not for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy.......&#39;,
   &#39;The fact that this film was put out on DVD still formatted-to TV and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists......and rightly so. This deserves a lot better treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft (the rules of the day) and winds up with a little girl instead (not the conventional way) ....and the problems that ensue afterward. The old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old man &#34;Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu)is kind of funny-looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin. The little girl &#34;Doggie&#34; (Zhou Renying) is a cutie. The rest of the story is how the two manage after that. I usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it\&#39;s involving story complete with drama, suspense, humor and sadness. Just don\&#39;t expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the DVD. Until it comes out on widescreen, rent it.&#39;,
   &#39;Director Edward Montagne does in a little more than one hour what other, more expensive and hyped films fail to do. Mr. Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. that while, is not one of the best of the genre, it keeps the viewer involved in all that\&#39;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is clearly a B type movie. In fact, the best thing going for &#34;The Tattooed Stranger&#34; is the opportunity to take a peek at the way New York looked in those years. The crystal clear cinematography by William O. Steiner, either has been kept that way through the years, or has been lovingly restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are great views of New York in the opening sequence. Later we are taken to Brooklyn to the Dumbo section and later on the film travels to the Bronx and the Gun Hill Road area with its many monument stores in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a great detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as the plant expert from the Museum of Natural History. Jack Lord, who went to bigger things in his career, is seen in a non speaking role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was great fun to watch a city, as it was, because it doesn\&#39;t exist any more.&#39;,
   &#34;One of the best movies out there. Yeah maybe the cinematography wasn&#39;t the greatest, but an excellent plot and concept. Great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and great fun. One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. Post World War 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while. The sets are not amazing, but simple and worked for the overall look of the film. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out cause I have loved it since it came out. Not a mainstream flick and not like anything you&#39;ve ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It&#39;s a great view and very fun.&#34;,
   &#39;Although a tear jerker it is definitely a &#34;feel good&#34; movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith as always, does the job and does it well. I could go on but pick any ten of the &#34;10&#34; ratings and they\&#39;ve said it as well and likely better than I could. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, since I must include at least 10 lines to post a comment I will say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was most enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her perform in many films to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, this film demonstrates that Will Smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor.&#39;,
   &#39;I have had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff\&#39;s book &#34;Can\&#39;t Find My Way Home&#34; which is chock full of info on the drug culture of America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff!! I found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70\&#39;s stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. Whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era. Hopefully they will package them and sell them as a CD set. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960\&#39;s experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie &#34;Blow&#34;), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60\&#39;s-80\&#39;s.&#39;,
   &#39;Wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge, an ace mountain rescue climber Gabriel Walker (Stallone) comes back for his girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner), while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening, a spectacularly precarious mid-air hijacking goes wrong and $100 million taken from a Treasury Department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stranded off the snowy peaks, and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash, the high-trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Gab and Hall (Michael Rooker) have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake, and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic (John Lithgow),are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With breathtaking shots, vertiginous scenery, dizzying heights, perilous climbs, freezing temperatures, &#34;Cliffhanger&#34; is definitely Stallone\&#39;s best action adventure movie\x85&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;ve just seen it....for those who don&#39;t know what it is, I suggest to download the entire feature and enjoy viewing it...it&#39;s kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short Batman Dead End, but this time besides the black knight there is also Superman... It would be wonderful if they made the entire movie...but I&#39;m afraid that it&#39;s almost impossible, especially just before the official Batman 5 film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- There is no greater crime against peace than the refusal to fight for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorenzo &#39;Purifier&#39;Pinto&#34;,
   &#34;The last film in Lucas&#39; saga is a lavish, spectacular-looking production. It is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it is a notch above episode IV (and just a notch below episodes III and V). In fact, I think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga. As far as I&#39;m concerned, it is still a grandiosely entertaining film. It is not a movie with a beginning, climax and ending; the film&#39;s mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind: bring closure to Lucas&#39; universe. There is an air of finality attached to the whole thing, which makes the film a little too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it is a lot of fun. New characters are introduced and old ones face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a great character to identify with. Again, it is Luke&#39;s (and Vader&#39;s) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone. Lucas&#39; aggressive imagination is still very much apparent, and the film&#39;s themes of loyalty, hope, and redemption resonate strongly. I&#39;m glad Lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a great bookend to a long, fascinating and captivating saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinée style.&#34;,
   &#39;This is a weird movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a (really fake looking) mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it. Well, pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy. And shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the woman\&#39;s family. This is actually REALLY BORING, overall, and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it. But if you keep at it, you may just make it to the end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the mummy\&#39;s spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to ascertain what the spirit\&#39;s motivation is, but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low-budget (and 70\&#39;s hairstyles!) this will have a certain comforting appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I have described the story is much clearer than the jumbled, boring way the film lays the story out. Can a boring movie really be fascinating? Well...somehow this one achieves that. Maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way. I don\&#39;t know. What I do know is that I enjoyed it quite a bit, despite its dullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of &#34;Spider Baby&#34; will be interested to know that a couple of music cues from that film are used in this one (including an instrumental version of the theme song).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featuring one frightening and fairly well-done sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper. Other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky; but this one scene is actually pretty scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See this! It\&#39;s weird and it\&#39;s worth your time. You might even want one on your shelf.&#39;,
   &#39;If you like animal movies, this movie will please. My wife likes animals and animal movies, she especially like the parrot in this film. It is geared towards kids, but I laughed at most of the humor. The French fashion character made me laugh, and adds balance to the script. It is a Disney film, with its sappy, happily, family apeal, but I like leaving the theater with a positive fealing.&#39;,
   &#34;Difficult film to comment on, how do you say it&#39;s bad? Well it isn&#39;t, but then it&#39;s equally difficult to say it is good. What it is, is compelling viewing, it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there. It is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand brought to life, you know you want to turn away but you have to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Naudet brothers handle the commentary very well, even in the most tragic of circumstances, there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults. The facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#39;t change history, and you should not want, this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour.&#34;,
   &#34;This is a real eye candy. A world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities. Huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is hurling cathedrals at their opponents... Who can resist that? An ancient prophecy, a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero... sounds familiar...? Yes we heard that song before. But You will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after leaving the cinema You&#39;ll be longing for a little bit more story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is behind the 30-years-circle? What drove the knight crazy? Who built all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities... and why are they falling apart? And apart from that one bunch of farmers, where are the people? Really, this picture looks so intriguing, but it&#39;s no Lord of the Rings.&#34;,
   &#34;TIllman Jr.&#39;s drama about the first African American Navy Master Diver (Gooding Jr.), who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer. The screenplay is not bad, a bit extreme at times, but the direction and acting is first-rate, and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do. I liked DeNiro in the lead, although its not on par with his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and all the others) it is as good as his other good performances such as in King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and believable here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, definitely one of his better performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10&#34;,
   &#39;There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not too important since what happened to whom and when is still in dispute. The most blatant liberty with the facts I think is when they start to play at Bruno Koschmidder\&#39;s Kaiserkeller, when in fact they played at the Indra and moved to the Kaiserkeller later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was biased in favour of Pete Best\&#39;s version, but if he is the story consultant then I guess he calls the shots. I also agree with Semprinni that the recordings Pete Best plays on say the last word on the subject of why he was fired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the film is not such a lavish production as the later film &#34;Backbeat&#34;, I prefer this film because it is more accurate, and because it has a better script with deeper characterisation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty in the film that is quite substantial - such as Brian Epstein trying to hide the fact that he has been &#34;queer-bashed,&#34; only to find out that the band knew he was Gay all along. Little touches like the band going into a café and ordering &#34;Corn-Flakes mit Milch.&#34; My favourite scene, which does have some bassis in fact, is where at an audition Stuart Sutcliffe has just bought his bass guitar but can\&#39;t play it, so he stands with his back to the impresario and tries faking it, but gets caught. That\&#39;s rock \&#39;n\&#39; roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth watching.&#39;,
   &#34;Masters of Horror: Right to Die starts late one night as married couple Abby (Julia Anderson) &amp; Ciff Addison (Martin Donovan) are driving home, however while talking Cliff is distracted &amp; crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road. Cliff&#39;s airbag works OK &amp; he walks away with minor injuries, unfortunately for Abby hers didn&#39;t &amp; she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car &amp; doused in petrol which set alight burning her entire body. Abby&#39;s life is saved, just. She is taken to hospital where she is on life support seriously injured &amp; horribly disfigured from the burns. Cliff decides that she should die, his selfish lawyer Ira (Corbin Bersen) thinks they should let Abby die, sue the car manufacturer &amp; get rich while Abby&#39;s mum Pam (Linda Sorenson) wants to blame Cliff, get rich &amp; save Abby. However Abby has other plans of her own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This American Canadian co-production was directed by Rob Schmidt (whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn (2003) which on it&#39;s own hardly qualifies him to direct a Masters of Horror episode) &amp; was episode 9 from season 2 of the Masters of Horror TV series, while I didn&#39;t think Right to Die was the best Masters of Horror episode I&#39;ve seen I thought it was a decent enough effort all the same &amp; still doesn&#39;t come close to being as bad as The Screwfly Solution (2006). The script by John Esposito has a neat central idea that isn&#39;t anything new but it uses it effectively enough although I&#39;d say it&#39;s a bit uneven, the first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama as the legal wrangling over Abby&#39;s life &amp; the affair Cliff is having take center stage before it gets back on track it a deliciously gory &amp; twisted climax that may not be for the faint of heart. The character&#39;s are a bit clichéd, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum &amp; the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough, the dialogue is OK, the story moves along at a nice pace &amp; overall I liked Right to Die apart from a few minutes here &amp; there where it loses it&#39;s focus a bit &amp; I wasn&#39;t that keen on the ambiguous ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Schmidt does a good job &amp; there are some effective scenes, this tries to alternate between low key spooky atmosphere &amp; out-and-out blood &amp; gore. There are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual, there&#39;s shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body &amp; the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross (images &amp; make-up effects that reminded me of similar scenes in Hellraiser (1987) &amp; it&#39;s sequels), then there&#39;s the main course at the end where Cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open &amp; him peeling it off the muscle &amp; putting it into a cooler box! Very messy. There are also various assorted body parts. There&#39;s some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically Right to Die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant &amp; as most Masters of Horror episodes it doesn&#39;t look like a cheap made-for-TV show which basically if the truth be told it is. The acting was fine but there&#39;s no big &#39;names&#39; in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right to Die is another enjoyable &amp; somewhat twisted Masters of Horror episode that most horror fans should definitely check out if not just for the terrific skinning scene! Well worth a watch... for those with the stomach.&#34;,
   &#39;Indian Summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, heartwarming, and absolutely loved it! Anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the &#34;good Ole\&#39; days&#34; for a brief time really needs to see this one! It starts out as 20 years later, a group of old campers returns for a &#34;reunion&#34;. I won\&#39;t comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself. The actors were great, and it contains an all star cast. Everyone in it played a terrific role. You actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it. Alan Arkin was especially good in his role as Uncle Lou. He plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat! HIGHLY Recommended!&#39;,
   &#34;Kenneth Branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of Shakespeare&#39;s most classic and well-written tragedy. Kenneth plays the role of Hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears. Kate Winslet&#39;s performance is also of great note.&#34;,
   &#34;Ride with the Devil, like Ang Lee&#39;s later Brokeback Mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. Film lovers ought to see it at minimum twice as its artistic nuance is worthy to be over comprehended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfect piece of art, surprising depth of humanity. I really don&#39;t recall another war film, will so capture you, will change your existing conception of history and politics, will restore your belief in humanity. After seeing so many killings, so many sufferings , you don&#39;t feel yourself numb, instead you treasure the bond between human beings more. The actors&#39; performances haunt your heart, the music drives your mind. Some shoots, are not just some pictures, they transcend themselves, becoming the seeing of soul. Such is the true sense of film being a genre of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film like this doesn&#39;t need long comments or reviews, everything it says by itself. Ovation to the cast which includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the cinematographer and the composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!&#34;,
   &#39;Russell, my fav, is gorgeous in this film. But more than that, the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I replay their scenes over and over again. Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people. All characters are cast and portrayed excellently.&#39;,
   &#34;Caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for. Many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn&#39;t like it as it was not what they wanted to see. The above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you&#39;re a fan of the genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absolute diamond, a film i still have on video to this day. Check it out.&#34;,
   &#39;This film is exactly what its title describes--an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it\&#39;s kinda fun to see the 1996-style Toronto I remember with all its silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes, and attitude. It really hasn\&#39;t changed any; just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types! It\&#39;s also amusing to see Kenny and Spenny head to L.A. and find out that it\&#39;s Toronto all over again, only with a strange assortment of beach bums, musicians, fortune tellers, and yet more uppity film types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t see Pitch as a film to be enjoyed; it\&#39;s not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone\&#39;s aspirations being trampled. I take Pitch as a warning that power and money is really held by studio execs and production houses. Would-be (and &#34;successful&#34;) writers, musicians, and actors are still mere transients even when they reach the Big Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or don\&#39;t, but the message is still there.&#39;,
   &#39;Look, if I were interested in a Nancy Drew book, what I would do is pick up a book and read it. I\&#39;m not. Ever since I can remember I read people trashing movies because it wasn\&#39;t like the book. I\&#39;m sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books, however I\&#39;m sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form. When Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When the third one won an Oscar - &#34;The book was better.&#34; When I watched To Kill a Mockingbird, &#34;the book was better.&#34; Now a bunch of people are upset, yet again, because Nancy Drew wasn\&#39;t like the book. I\&#39;m not saying Nancy Drew is going to win any Oscars - if anything it\&#39;ll be one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I\&#39;m saying give film a break. It\&#39;s film, not paper. As a movie, I found Nancy Drew quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles featuring Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on the O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She\&#39;s All That). This is the first time I\&#39;ve seen Emma Roberts in a movie and, frankly, I enjoy her work more than most of Julia and of Eric\&#39;s; her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict. A lighthearted movie in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is nice now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it ten stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, would love to see it again, and will probably buy it upon DVD release.&#39;,
   &#34;We all create our own reality, or do we? That is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality. Blending Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of `Who are we and what is our place in the universe?&#39;, and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes. The film centers on Bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, `The Sea That Thinks.&#39; As he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer, writing the screenplay. Before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. Ultimately, de Graaff&#39;s film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be, or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses. Note: AFTER you&#39;ve seen the movie, check out the film&#39;s entertaining web site. (Dutch with English subtitles) --Eric Moore&#34;,
   &#39;Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet. Not surprising, since King himself wrote the screenplay. The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud, a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. The other is a path leading to the Pet Sematary, where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway. Soon enough, Ellie Creed\&#39;s cat, Church, is found dead. Luckily, this happens while the family, with the exception of Louis(the father), is away for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another burial ground, beyond the Pet Sematary, where Church is to be buried. Later, Louis is greeted(not so politely) by Church. He\&#39;s returned, appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more I can say without ruining the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the King adaptions I\&#39;ve seen this would be the most terrifying. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings. Suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film, due in part to the plot development. The scene where Gage is killed will stick in your mind forever. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. Easy to determine what\&#39;s going to happen, but Lambert pulls off some genuinely scary, and sometimes disturbing, moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good film and an excellent adaption. If you enjoy being scared and don\&#39;t mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then &#34;Pet Sematary&#34; is just what you\&#39;re looking for. Non Horror fans will want to avoid this.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a good film for 99% of the duration. I feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is shot in a rather naive fashion. This is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the &#39;nutcase&#39; called Joe. However, the wholesome (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted, they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little OTT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts slowly (and the naive camera work smacks of &#39;B&#39; movie to start with) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur. This is one of the most &#39;twisted&#39; movies with respect to cold-hearted violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending I was left feeling disappointed. I would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the &#39;eeriness&#39; and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a watch and excuse the ending!&#34;,
   &#39;I admit not being that fond of Oliver! as a young child--it\&#39;s long, and the story is a little slow-moving because of all the musical numbers. As a teenager I discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself. Rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of the classic story. The adaptation is loose at best, but really, if you\&#39;re watching a musical, you ain\&#39;t there for the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is the core of this movie, and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy. Most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical, and it shows in their performances--and I consider this a plus. The performances are all in a more &#34;stagey&#34; style of acting typical of much older films, and they are very entertaining. The exception is the kid playing Oliver, whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real performers\&#39; way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fagin and the Dodger are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating screen presence as the menacing Bill Sykes. Even Sykes\&#39; dog Bullseye puts on a good performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie isn\&#39;t for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise it, as will those who take musicals too seriously. Nitpicking over faulty historical details or mistaking exaggerated stage-type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone\&#39;s enjoyment. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment--it\&#39;s much better if you remember that, as a musical, it\&#39;s a fantasy loosely organized around the book, not a strict adaptation.&#39;,
   &#34;That movie was awesome! I can&#39;t get over it&#39;s songs. I think I&#39;m a little too old for musicals, but that movie deserves some credit here, guys! My especial favorite was Jack Wild. Me, being a British actor lover, you can&#39;t restrain me from all those nice-looking fresh faced, young men. I never knew that when Jack was doing that movie he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven- year old. He&#39;s short, that&#39;s what helps. Try posting up your replies, fellow posters, so I can relate to your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think that drone look is really familiar. Any idea where he&#39;s starred in before? If so, post it up, I&#39;d really like to know.&#34;,
   &#39;Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I sure am glad that I have now! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then Eddie. I could not stop laughing for the entire show. If you like to laugh you HAVE to see this special!&#39;,
   &#34;This has to be one of my favourite movies of all time. The dialogue, with the constant use of puns is very tight, the cast are superb, and the plot is highly original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t take my word for it - watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself.&#34;,
   &#39;WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS, in my opinion, is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Anytime Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) threw up, I wanted to vomit myself. It\&#39;s kind of hard to explain why. If you ask me, they should have been more cooperative about things. However, I did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents. Before I wrap this up, I\&#39;d like to say, &#34;If you ask me, WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person\&#39;s body. &#34; Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone who hasn\&#39;t seen it. You\&#39;re in for some tears and a good time, so the next time it\&#39;s on TV, kick back with a friend and watch it.&#39;,
   &#34;I enjoyed a lot watching this movie. It has a great direction, by the already know Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is precisely in Spain that the movie takes place, in Cataluña, to be more precise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luna explores once more the theme of an obcession, in this case the obcession of a young boy for the women&#39;s milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother. In the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother&#39;s milk go to the recently born son. So he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him. He finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie lives a lot on imagery, more than the story itself, the espectator captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something...). The surroundings, the landscapes, typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters, also symbolic, and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani transport us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which intersects it from times to times... Worth living in that world, worth watching this movie, even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession, which is perhaps taken beyond the limits...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist... 8/10&#34;,
   &#39;The opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission, as Cheech and Chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot, filled with gas. &#34;Don\&#39;t Spill it Man !&#34;, hilarious stuff. And then, as \&#39;the plot\&#39; ensues, you\&#39;re in for one heck of a ride. I watched this film recently and it holds up, being just as funny upon each viewing. check it out.&#39;,
   &#34;I gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes... this is definitely really about a 5.5..... Ummm.. it was kind of bloody, had likeable, shallow characters, and it had some really hot babes in it. I like the eclectic killer, because he didn&#39;t kill people the same way everytime... that sometimes gets old.&#34;,
   &#34;There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and societal means. Not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as wage inequality, and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setting is the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup. Passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The women who were caught (Played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani, and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and, most likely, all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them, both city and villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it&#39;s women from the crude behavior of it&#39;s men. Rather than educating the male population, they deny privilege and rights to the women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of Iranian society, it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it.&#34;,
   &#39;This is one of those Film\&#39;s/pilot that if you knew BattleStar Galactica it helps, but isn\&#39;t necessary. What makes this even more believable of a story than BSG is that this isn\&#39;t something so far away in the future. This has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically. The leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced &amp; quite talented actors. Eric Stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re-united w/his daughter however real or not she is &amp; he\&#39;ll do it no matter the cost. Paula Malcomson of &#34;Deadwood&#34; fame is terrific as his wife as well. You are not sure completely of his motives whether it\&#39;s love or money or both, but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in the making of Zoe played by the relative unknown Alessandra Torresani &amp; her performance. Esai Morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again &amp; just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections. I didn\&#39;t think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone I am thrilled to see how we got to the BSG stage story. It\&#39;s great to see Adama as a child already being affected &amp; influenced by the different sorts of Robots starting to permeate life at this stage. I just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the Humanoid typed robots. This is an almost perfect pilot &amp; I hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling. Even the Visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you haven\&#39;t gotten into BSG, @ least try this &amp; I\&#39;ll bet you become a fan &amp; will want to see how the BSG story came to be.&#39;,
   &#39;In New York, when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) in the subway, he invites her to date and have dinner with him. Jenny immediately falls in love for him, they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him, telling that she is the powerful superhero G-Girl. After meeting his co-worker and friend Hannah Lewis (Anna Faris), the needy Jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and Matt follows the advice of his best friend Vaughn Haige (Rainn Wilson) and dumps her, breaking her heart. Jenny turns Matt\&#39;s life into hell, while he has a romance with Hannah. However, the archenemy of G-Girl and former high school sweetheart of Jenny, Professor Bedlam (Eddie Izzard), proposes Matt to lure Jenny to strip her superpowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&#34; is delightfully silly and funny. This romantic comedy-adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining. Luke Wilson is great in the role of an idiot, Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual, and Uma Thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls Glenn Close in &#34;Fatal Attraction&#34; or Evelyn Draper in &#34;Play Misty For Me&#34;. My vote is seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Minha Super Ex-Namorada&#34; (&#34;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&#34;)&#39;,
   &#34;The 4th Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Don&#39;t you dare say that Pokemon sucks! I don&#39;t like it when people say that.... I&#39;ve liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, please say that Pokemon is great and should be enjoyed by people for all ages. And also, why do Pokemon-haters give low ratings for all or most of the Pokemon movies? I don&#39;t understand.... They shouldn&#39;t do that.... There&#39;s absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that Pokemon sucks besides the fact that: 1) Pokemon is for little kids ONLY. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People shouldn&#39;t like Pokemon. I think this is why people don&#39;t like Pokemon.&#34;,
   &#34;EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me somewhat of Warren William), heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglas Walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise (hypnotism, anyone?), and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast--everyone from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and H.B. Warner. As an added bonus, there&#39;s Nat Pendleton as a dimwit detective--and furthermore, get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home. Must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled. It&#39;s all suddenly clear to detective Philo Vance--and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner.&#34;,
   &#39;A lot of people unfairly sh!t on this series but several of the Guinea Pig videos are fairly entertaining. Devil\&#39;s Experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work--not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic--especially for the video\&#39;s vintage and low-budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start at the beginning now for those who don\&#39;t know: This film is an &#34;extreme&#34; torture/fake snuff film that surfaced in Japan in the mid-80s. It\&#39;s plot as it stands is simple: A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is. This entails brutal violence--all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl\&#39;s arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. These two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actress who plays the victim of the &#34;experiment&#34; is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera. Her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling. Some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest. Also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels till she pukes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven\&#39;t seen this series I hope I have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot. 8.5/10 for Devil\&#39;s Experiment.&#39;,
   &#34;This film surprised me a little. I watch a lot of horror/sci-fi films and this is a straight-to-video release that caught me off guard a little. I believe this is Full Moon&#39;s best movie thus far and one of Jeffrey Combs best performances. Good movie.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is very good. The screenplay is enchanting. But Meryl Streep is most impressive. Her performance is excellent. She brings me to go into the heart of her role.&#39;,
   &#34;I love full house so much that i couldn&#39;t live without full house. Why did it end? It upsets a lot of the fan of it. Can we have a Full House II? Oh, come on! But it is better that we have those DVD to help us. But i need those real ones to come up with another new episode. Love, Warmth are filled the house! All the characters are very cute and handsome! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, and John Stamos, loooooooove you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey, and Jesse please come back to the screen please! How is Michelle after falling down from a horse? How are Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or is he having a wife or at least a girlfriend? Are they still living in the same house? I want to continue the life of full house! and please don&#39;t upset me!&#34;,
   &#39;A noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of Oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped. The first was Marlee Matlin\&#39;s award for &#34;Children of a Lesser God&#34; in 1986, and the next ten years were to see another &#34;Best Actress&#34; award (Holly Hunter for &#34;The Piano&#34; in 1994) and no fewer than five &#34;Best Actor&#34; awards (Dustin Hoffman in 1988 for &#34;Rain Man&#34;, Daniel Day-Lewis in 1989 for &#34;My Left Foot&#34;, Al Pacino in 1992 for &#34;Scent of a Woman&#34;, Tom Hanks in 1994 for &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; and Geoffrey Rush in 1996 for &#34;Shine&#34;) for portrayals of the disabled. Matlin, who played a deaf woman, is herself deaf, but all the others are able-bodied. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time, with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting. When Jodie Foster failed to win &#34;Best Actress&#34; for &#34;Nell&#34; in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal. My view, however, is that the majority of these awards were well deserved. I thought the 1992 award should have gone to either Clint Eastwood or Robert Downey rather than Pacino, but apart from that the only one with which I disagreed would have been Hanks\&#39;, and that was because I preferred Nigel Hawthorne\&#39;s performance in &#34;The Madness of King George&#34;. In that film, of course, Hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;My Left Foot&#34; was based upon the autobiography of the Irish writer and painter Christy Brown. Brown was born in 1931, one of the thirteen children of a working-class Dublin family. He was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well. He was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech, but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body, his left foot (hence the title). He learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes, and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life in working-class Dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard, and the city Jim Sheridan (himself a Dubliner) shows us here is in many ways a grim, grey, cheerless place, very different from our normal idea of the &#34;Emerald Isle&#34;. (Sheridan and Day-Lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an Irish theme, &#34;In the Name of the Father&#34;). Against this, however, must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people, especially the Brown family. Much of Christy\&#39;s success was due to the support he received from his parents, who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior, and from his siblings. We see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially-made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build Christy a room of his own in their back yard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart-warming &#34;triumph over adversity&#34; movie. That it does not is due to a number of factors, principally the magnificent acting. In the course of his career, Day-Lewis has given a number of fine performances, but this, together with the recent &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34;, is his best. He is never less than 100% convincing as Christie; his tortured, jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person, even though, intellectually, we are well aware that Day-Lewis is able-bodied. The other performances which stand out are from Fiona Shaw as his mentor Dr Eileen Cole, from Hugh O\&#39;Conor as the young Christy and from Brenda Fricker as Christy\&#39;s mother (which won her the &#34;Best Supporting Actress&#34; award). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character. Christy Brown had a difficult life, but he could also be difficult to live with, and the film gives us a &#34;warts and all&#34; portrait. He was a heavy drinker, given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage. He could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him, and the film shows us all these aspects of his character. Of course, it also shows us the positive aspects- his courage, his determination and his wicked sense of humour. Day-Lewis\&#39;s acting is not just physically convincing, in that it persuades us to believe in his character\&#39;s disability, but also emotionally and intellectually convincing, in that it brings out all these different facets of Christy\&#39;s character. His Oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of Robin Williams and Kenneth Branagh, but it was well deserved. 8/10&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;I moved out here to get away from this kind of thing!&#34; The small town sheriff laments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;This happens a lot in Chicago?&#34; His deputy asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians mistake a Halloween Rebroadcast of Orson Welles\&#39; War of the Worlds as an account of a real Martian invasion, and conclude they need to get in on the action! What follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the Martian\&#39;s haphazard attempts to conquer the town of &#34;Big Bean, IL&#34;. Everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes, except for the Sheriff\&#39;s daughter and her friend, a kid in a duck suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on. It\&#39;s a fun family movie.&#39;,
   &#39;This episode is certainly different than all the other Columbos, though some of the details are still there, the setup is completely different. That makes this Columbo unique, and interesting to watch, even though at times you might wish for the old Columbo. I liked it a lot, but then, I like almost any Columbo.&#39;,
   &#39;What can i say about this movie? I have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6. I have seen the english version and it is done very well. It is a great movie for all ages, but it is directed more for children. I love the childlike humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!&#39;,
   &#39;This is one of the most calming, relaxing, and beautifully made animation films I\&#39;ve ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, the sounds and music can make you feel like you\&#39;re in the movie! This movie is not just great for kids, but adults too. It teaches you lessons, such as never forget who you are, you can do whatever you stick your mind to, and to brave and daring. This movie can make you cry at times too, which is always a nice touch in movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute, and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them, and the movie &#34;Spirit&#34; is definitely one of them! With my vote of 9/10 stars for animation, music, and a wonderful idea for a movie, it gave me a whole lot of Spirit!&#39;,
   &#34;I found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get-go. When Miss Stanwyck starts her narration it&#39;s only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming. The deserted area, the lock on the deserted gas station door, everything sets you up to wait for it...here it comes. At first you think it will be about the little boy, but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in. I found this movie to be really stressful, even though I had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement. Now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating, maybe a white knuckles award?&#34;,
   &#39;I am extremely picky about the films I see. I\&#39;d heard about Moon Child completely by accident. I\&#39;ve been a fan of L\&#39;Arc En Ciel for some time and a fan of Gackt and Mizer only recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally found out the film was being re-released and picked it up without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being as critical as I am about films, I will admit, the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times...but they\&#39;re meant too be, as another user suggested, it\&#39;s the quintessential calm before the storm, quoting Gary Oldman from Leon...without getting into the spoilers, the film hit me extremely hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and like marriage, it\&#39;s until death do you part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyde and Gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics, their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one\&#39;s soul and evoke response emotionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon seeing the film for the first time, I realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes. I want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend in film...this takes an entirely new direction using classic Yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from Ryo Ishibashi of Takashi Miike\&#39;s &#34;Audition&#34; and &#34;Suicide Club&#34; fame?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man..I just can\&#39;t say enough about this film, but I\&#39;ll stop here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#39;,
   &#39;I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Larson\&#39;s comments about it being a &#34;sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths&#34; were dead on. Writers probably shouldn\&#39;t get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natasha\&#39;s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she is in goes on my favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie doesn\&#39;t seem to available in DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too.&#39;,
   &#34;Several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters. The shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives. All are transformed at the end of the movie. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; Her daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) is retarded and has a restricted life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife. Isabel (Ángela Molina) is a bored rich lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other characters are used to connect the five main women characters. In storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning: Some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience. The shoe-theme is driven to extremes: For example when Leire as a shoe-designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints, she breaks one of her heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In editing small connections are made between the scenes. A telephone rings, a cigarette is lit, a song, etc. are used to make the connection and fast cuts. Frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching TV-levels. It is strongly music-driven to set tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories, and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters. One of the more moving shots is when Anita, who makes the same walk every day, widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road: How the restriction of space is visually translated is well done. As with most Spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually, using the soap-like stories as the simple backdrop. There is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ramón Salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong. Some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level, including the acting (Adela&#39;s love life, Isabel&#39;s doctor). The shoe-theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is more technically competent, but somewhat mechanical. This has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually. After seeing this, you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie-city: Madrid.&#34;,
   &#34;I wasn&#39;t expecting much, and, to be honest, I didn&#39;t like this film the first time around but watching it again and I realised that it&#39;s kinda cool. Sure, it&#39;s a one joke film but it&#39;s a funny gag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be. I think this film had the potential to be a over-the-top My Cousin Vinny. But with a horror host instead of a lawyer. Sadly it&#39;s a wasted opportunity. With just a bit more writing it could be a classic. The kids are underused there&#39;s no reason why they should latch on to Elvira. Apart from the obvious reasons. It would have been great to see their relationship flourish. I know it&#39;s a comedy but it&#39;s little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elvira herself is always fun and engaging. Not to mention flirty. Every time she smiles you will too. It&#39;s hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming. And it really is her charm, don&#39;t let her looks fool you into thinking that she&#39;s some sort of tart. Well she is. But she&#39;s a nice one. The sort of person you&#39;d let look after your kids. Wouldn&#39;t let her cook for them, though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d recommend giving it a go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#39;t expect too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#39;s more than just a great set of boobs. She&#39;s also an incredible pair of legs.&#34;,
   &#34;Indeed: drug use, warehouse shoot-&#39;em-ups, &#39;Matrix&#39;-esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races, and a lonely vampire --all in the same movie-- seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a Japanese pop/rock star. And that is exactly what &#39;Moon Child&#39; is, and more. While all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy B-movie of the week, &#39;Moon Child&#39; pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has a gritty, definitely independent feel to it, jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds, giving glimpses into the characters&#39; lives and barely scraping at a true plot. But the film makes no excuses, instead turning the story into one of friendship, love, trust, and betrayal all sugar-coated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, warring gangsters, and vampires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HYDE as the somber vampire &#39;Kei&#39; is excellent, giving depth to the character and balancing-out the overly-zealous acting of Gackt as &#39;Sho,&#39; an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as the vengeful &#39;Son&#39; who becomes friends with a grown-up Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives, and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the action at times is all-too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show-off, one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular Asian singers it features. The superstars as actors have their flaws, and so do their characters. The movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit. &#39;Moon Child&#39; is rather enjoyable, humorous at times, and even very touching: it is definitely worth your time!&#34;,
   &#39;Hrm-I think that line was from the old movie posters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator. Here\&#39;s a tip: Any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading &#34;In the future...&#34; is going to be fun. This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, &#34;In the future...&#34; means that, instead of fighting wars, nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine, well, that\&#39;s never terribly clear, but it\&#39;s probably something really important. There are good guys (obviously capitalists, i.e. &#34;us&#34;) and bad guys (Commies!) and there are big stop-motion robots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the effects budget was pretty slim, so we don\&#39;t get to see a lot of the big robots. There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a big space fight near the end. The space fight is especially nice, as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With said money now spent, the climactic fight degenerates into (and I\&#39;m not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. I can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene, complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said-it\&#39;s dumb. That\&#39;s why I bought the tape.&#39;,
   &#39;In reflecting on this movie I can think of two others to help put it in perspective. One relatively forgettable but covering the same geography, is Coup de Torchon, the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of Indochine, the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was struck with the dignity of Potee, with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck with the love/hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force, it is the latter that links this movie to Indochine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One never is sure what motivates everyone, though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon. Theirs is the more scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American black who gives the grown up France a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the Western world have when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. He was coming home, but they just thought him to be a little daft. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;Arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life far too seriously!!! Watch this film for what it is, sit back, relax and have a giggle. The film does not take itself seriously, so neither should we. If you like James Belushi, you will like this film. If he is not your cup of tea - give it a miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like James Belushi, so I liked this film. So simple isn&#39;t it?? :-)&#34;,
   &#39;I enjoyed this film. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that\&#39;s never happened before - a Secret Service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas\&#39; character, &#34;Pete Garrison,&#34; they think HE\&#39;s the mole but he isn\&#39;t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He\&#39;s just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the First Lady! Since he\&#39;s doing that, he\&#39;s unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it\&#39;s revealed there is a plot to kill the President.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Garrison&#34; is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he\&#39;s still trying to do the right thing by protecting the President. Douglas does a fine job in this role. I don\&#39;t always care the people he plays but he\&#39;s an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland (&#34;David Breckinridge&#34;) is equally as good (at least in here) as the fellow SS boss who hunts down Douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth. When he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. The crooks are interesting, too, by the way. Also, I have never - and never will, unfortunately - see a First Lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish. Are there holes in it? Of course; probably a number of them, and a reason you see so many critical comments. However, it is unfairly bashed here. It just isn\&#39;t intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website. My advice: chill, just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, it gets a little Rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment.....which is what movies are all about.&#39;,
   &#39;Since Douglas MacArthur affected more human lives\x97for the better\x97than any other American not elected President, he deserved a better film biography. Not that Universal\&#39;s &#34;MacArthur&#34; is bad. It\&#39;s just not all it should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, the potential was there. From the very early &#34;Star Trek&#34; episode &#34;The Corbomite Maneuver&#34; (1966) to the recent HBO films &#34;Something the Lord Made&#34; (2OO4) and &#34;Warm Springs&#34; (2OO5), director Joseph Sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film, a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors\&#39; performances, and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us &#34;Patton&#34; (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith scored both films, and Universal widely touted the fact that the film was &#34;four years in preparation and production.&#34; Yet for all of this, &#34;MacArthur&#34; is perfectly adequate\x97and not much more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins in early 1942, shortly before the beleaguered general was ordered\x97by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O\&#39;Herlihy)\x97to flee the Philippines to avoid capture by the Japanese. Thus, this film omits: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· MacArthur\&#39;s birth in 188O in a frontier barracks in Arkansas still subject to attack by Native American tribesmen\x97thus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows-and-arrows to thermonuclear weapons; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· his graduation from West Point\x97first in a class of 95, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· how he joined his famous father, General Arthur MacArthur (who had earned the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on assignments in Japan, China and, most importantly, in the Philippines; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into Vera Cruz; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· how he leaped about the trenches of World War One like a mountain goat, often wounded, and promoted with blinding speed to Brigadier General; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· his postwar service as West Point\&#39;s youngest\x97and most progressive\x97commandant; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· his participation in the court-martial of Billy Mitchell in 1924; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· his routing of the Bonus Marchers in 1932; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· his efforts to sustain a woefully-underfunded Army as Chief of Staff in the early 193O\&#39;s; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· his retirement from the U.S. Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Army of the Philippines; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;· and the reactivation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of MacArthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by PT boat\x97thus, we know that &#34;General Mac&#34; is a legend, but not why; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to &#34;Dugout Doug&#34;\x97and so patently unfounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly: His island-hopping &#34;Hit \&#39;em where they ain\&#39;t&#34; campaign, the fulfillment of his pledge to the Filipinos\x97 &#34;I shall return!&#34;\x97his crowning achievement, the winning of the peace in postwar Japan, then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (a properly feisty Ed Flanders) over the conduct of the Korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing, and finally, his proclamation to Congress that &#34;old soldiers\x85simply fade away,&#34; after which he did just that. All quite historically accurate, and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: If MacArthur\&#39;s actions appear noble, let them be presented as such; if they appear egotistical or bombastic, let those conceptions register sans comment. Since Joe Sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience\&#39;s reactions\x97again, see Warm Springs\x97this refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional. Historically, that may be commendable, but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, there is a sort of &#34;made on the cheap&#34; feel to the film, as there is to &#34;Midway,&#34; released about the same time. Both films were relegated to &#34;television&#34; directors--Sargent in this case, Jack Smight on &#34;Midway,&#34; and both have a made-for-TV-look. Even Jerry Goldsmith\&#39;s march, while perfectly serviceable, lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his &#34;Patton&#34; theme--just another way in which a larger-than-life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was vanity and pettiness in this man, inarguably; there was also greatness\x97and love him or loathe him, one must acknowledge the fact that MacArthur did what no military commander before him had done: he won the peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, &#34;MacArthur&#34;\x97like so many film biographies\x97is a good place to begin research into this remarkable man, but a poor place to end it.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a great movie for all ages. Its the story about three animals how have to find their way home. There is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie. You never know what is going to happen next. This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. You just don&#39;t know what going to happen next. The trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. They producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too. The animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 the whole way! Rent or buy it today I can guarantee you will love it the whole family will!&#34;,
   &#39;An enthralling, wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works, particularly the earlier ones, the silent era. Very enjoyable despite being a bit long, I found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet. Required viewing if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.&#39;,
   &#34;Bruce Almighty, one of Carrey&#39;s best pictures since... well... a long time. It contains one of the funniest scenes I have seen for a long time too... Morgan Freeman plays God well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. It contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes. The best scene in, it is where Jim is messing up the anchor man&#39;s voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: 8/10&#34;,
   &#34;Anyone who loves the Rheostatics&#39; music is going to enjoy this film. I have some minor complaints, mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors (not Maury) who aren&#39;t really convincing in their roles, but I don&#39;t have time write a detailed review. I just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented CBC television in Canada: The version that airs are the CBC is like the Reader&#39;s Digest version of WHALE MUSIC---don&#39;t watch it. It cuts out entire scenes and subplots (if you can them that) from the film. The CBC, which presents most of films untouched, took half the guts out of WHALE MUSIC. I don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s horrible what they did to the film. Rent the video or watch it in a theatre, but DON&#39;T watch it on CBC television.&#34;,
   &#39;Timeless musical gem, with Gene Kelly in top form, stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli, and wonderful musical numbers. It is great entertainment from start to finish, one of those films that people watch with a smile and say &#34;they don\&#39;t make \&#39;em like they used to!&#34; But they never did quite make them like this. The climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history. Movie magic, clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved. A must see!&#39;,
   &#39;This was obviously the prototype for Mick Dundee but \&#39;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie is funnier. I was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times. Terrific central performance by Barry Crocker in the title role, an Australian who invades England to upset the poms with his free-flowing uncouth ways. Few Brits will be upset by Barry\&#39;s frequently cruel observations on his hosts. The relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the film\&#39;s final line, delivered by a somewhat reluctant McKenzie as he boards the plane home. &#34;I was just starting to like the poms.&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;Orson Welles manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his I see. Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial, and Chimes at Midnight. The plot can tend to be confusing sometimes, and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast (about an hour of it was edited out when test screenings went poorly). It doesn&#39;t matter, however. You can&#39;t watch Welles&#39; films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot. His direction defines what great direction is. Almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed. Check out the courtroom scene. Usually they are such stock scenes that I can&#39;t stand them. Case in point, try to sit through Welles&#39; own speech near the end of Compulsion. In Lady from Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail in that courtroom scene. Watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings. Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it is just a simple Venetian blind, and that it was used constantly in film noirs and crime films of the era, but Welles gives it a beauty all its own. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, a skill that no one else seemed to have, to make a crime film containing examples of the grandest poetry. Whether he was speaking Shakespeare or spitting out hard-boiled lines, it had the power to stir the soul. 10/10.&#34;,
   &#34;Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. Out of the blue, his father announces that Reda will be driving him to the Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca--something that Reda has no interest in doing but agrees only out of obligation. As a result, from the start, Reda is angry but being a traditional Muslim man, his father is difficult to talk to or discuss his misgivings. Both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible--and it&#39;s very ironic when the Dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read the summary, it talks about how much the characters grew and began to know each other. However, I really don&#39;t think they did and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the film. Sure, there were times of understanding, but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and repression. I actually liked this and appreciated that there wasn&#39;t complete resolution of this--as it would have seemed phony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the film is well acted and fascinating--giving Westerners an unusual insight into Islam and the Hajj. It also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam and the secular younger generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may annoy some, I think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a film about people--not some formula. A nice and unusual film.&#34;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t have much to add to what has been said before, but it\&#39;s very much a film of it\&#39;s time, and the first (and likely only) time that the studio hung the film totally on the Dead End Kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Warner\&#39;s gave the boys plenty of help, from director Ray Enright and an \&#39;A\&#39; budget, to an almost magical cast of supporting actors. At every turn, we get one of those gem performances from real pros. They are too many to list, but it seems like just about everybody on the Warner\&#39;s lot (Sans the very biggest stars) walk through this picture. (See if you can spot John Ridgely)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only over the top performance is from the always reliable Eduardo Cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of the Thuggie leader in &#34;Gunga Din&#34;. He\&#39;s something to watch! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role since &#34;Dead End&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like &#34;City for Conquest&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for Warners!&#39;,
   &#34;The story: On the island Texel, photographer Bob, who makes a photo shoot for a magazine, meets the mysterious Kathleen. Her free spirit and lust for life intrigues Bob, who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before. Her life is not so simple as it seems, however. Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. Will Kathleen be able to win his trust?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: The dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character&#39;s &#39;psychology&#39; would have been worked out a little more. Why do these people do the things they do? What motivates their choices? This is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view. The story never reaches an emotional climax, even though the characters go through enough to justify that. So you don&#39;t get to know the characters on that deeper level. The actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and &#39;believable&#39; way, but I think it would have suited the movie better if Kathleen had been played by a younger actress, as this character&#39;s naiveness doesn&#39;t quite work for a grown-up woman. Camera-work is nice, and there are some great shots of the nature on the island. I give the movie a 7/10.&#34;,
   &#34;Everything I remember about it was excellent... great cast with Sam Waterston &amp; George Innes (before he became more familiar to US audiences).... excellent scripts as only the English can do - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes/Lord Peter Wimsey/Albert Campion type mysteries, but with a Jules Verne twist. Sort of like MacGyver would have been had it been in England 80 years earlier... right at the beginning of the scientific/technological revolution of the 20th century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve often wondered if the creators of MacGyver saw these shows. MacGyver first aired about 3 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have 1 episode on a much deteriorated tape.&#34;,
   &#34;So often a band will get together for a re-union concert only to find that they just can&#39;t get it together. Not so here. This concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish. These three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone&#39;s ego. This is obvious from the start, before they even step on stage. Many faces in the crowd weren&#39;t even born when these guys first performed. From the first song they capture that old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no fuss. Clapton, by his own admission, said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers etc so we get to see him at his best. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many drummers today, speak of him as some sort of drumming guru. Jack Bruce just great. They really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come. This one&#39;s a 10 for me.&#34;,
   &#39;I am currently on vacation in Israel for summer, and so was able to see this incredible film. A bit of a warning before I begin writing: I speak fluent Hebrew, and so the Hebrew parts were no problem; however, about a quarter (a bit less) of the film is in Arabic, and I was unable to understand a bit of this subtitled bit. This did not detract from my understanding of the film, but did cause me to miss a few jokes which evoked some strong laughs in the theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year of American Cinema which many hailed as one of the greatest years for homosexual cinema and relationships, it takes something truly special to stand head and shoulders above the rest; yet, &#34;The Bubble&#34; surpasses all others with its blend of excellent acting, witty dialogue, and relevant political climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film opens on a checkpoint on the Israeli-Palestinian border; For the first few moments, we are unsure about the type of movie we have walked in on. Yet, this is an important element of this film\&#39;s strength. The political situation, and the extreme tension in the air is constantly in the background. Most importantly, Tel Aviv serves as a character of its own in this film. It is constantly referenced. Street names and restaurant names are constantly exchanged. The skyline and city development is critiqued quite harshly, and ultimately the city evolves along with the film The film focuses on the love between Noam (Ohad Knoller) and a Palestinian immigrant, Ashraf(Yousef \&#39;Joe\&#39; Sweid), with the societies of Tel Aviv and Palestine serving as a constant foil. We always know that their relationship is forbidden, and this creates a sense of urgency rarely present in cinema. The love is incredibly strong, and stands as the centerpiece of the film. The secondary relationships and friendships are equally strong: flamboyant restaurant owner Yelli\&#39;s ( Yousef \&#39;Joe\&#39; Sweid) relationship with the ultra-butch and grating golani solider, Golan (Zohar Liba), is particularly a source of amusement. The love scenes which abound in this film are all exquisite, fine crafted works of art, and the cinematography is astounding: In the first love scene of the film, the camera pans down as a male character gives oral sex to Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and dissolves into a shot of Noam and Ashraf. This shot any many others lead the viewer to realize that all of these relationships are expressions of the very same form of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give away more of the storyline would be a tragedy, but know that there is a lot of political tension and tragedy which touches onto the current world political climate, so I will instead focus on the witty dialogue. Even when watching this movie in my second language, I could not stop laughing throughout. Lines of particular amusement include the question of whether gay suicide bombers receive virgin women or men in heaven, and an analogy of Sampson from the bible as the worlds first suicide bomber. This dialogue shows a particular sense of purity and reality which is rarely seen in Cinema. The music used in the film is also particularly powerful. Music is only used in times when characters legitimately could or should be listening to it, and in one scene the music weakens when a character removes one earphone and stops when he removes the other. Little elements like this truly elevate the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not give greater recommendation to a film; this is a superb work of cinema which is catharthic as well as extremely well crafted.&#39;,
   &#39;In the immortal &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34;, we are introduced to a London where the slackers and the high-and-mighty alike are forced to battle flesh-eating, reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family. At the end of the film, it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour. &#34;Fido&#34; presents us with an epilogue to &#34;Shaun&#34; set in 1950\&#39;s America, in a hilariously witty and original &#34;what-if...?&#34; movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is set post-zombie-apocalypse, for a change; after the terrors of the Zombie Wars, ended by the creation of the ZomCon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs. Every town in the world is fenced off from the Wild Zone, the once-fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left-overs from the apocalyptic wars. The idyllic town of Willard is your typical, pristine 50\&#39;s suburbia, with one small difference; social status is measured by a family\&#39;s amount of domesticated zombies. Unfortunately, the Robinson family has no zombies whatsoever, due to their patriarch, Bill\&#39;s, fear of the reanimated dead. Timmy Robinson and his mother Helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life, until the day that Helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zombie earns Timmy\&#39;s love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies, and the two form a bond to rival the classic &#34;boy-and-his-dog&#34; cliché... a boy and his zombie. Timmy names his &#34;pet&#34; Fido, and he soon becomes an aid for both Timmy and Helen to escape the prison-like routine Bill has put them in. But when Fido\&#39;s domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly Mrs Henderson, the Robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved Fido.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all-star cast (including &#34;The Matrix&#34;\&#39;s Carrie-Anne Moss as Helen Robinson and Billy Connelly as Fido), &#34;Fido&#34; is a zom-com for the ages. With some rather twisted subplots - for example, the sweet and unsettling feelings that Helen and Fido begin to have for each other - and a poignant commentary on 50\&#39;s suburbia and the zombie genre, the film manages to bring out the worst (and the best) in its characters while still enabling you to care for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Fido&#34; is, by far, one of the best dark comedies I\&#39;ve ever seen, one of the best films that I\&#39;ve seen in a long time, and THE best zom-com since the incredible &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34;.&#39;,
   &#34;In the early to mid 1970&#39;s, Clifford Irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of Howard Hughes,claiming to have spent months preparing for the book,engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire. When all of this turned out to be false,Irving was accused of perjury &amp; spent several years behind bars (although always admitting his findings were accurate). Flash forward to 20001,several months prior to September 11th, a book,entitled &#39;Forbidden Love&#39; (published in the U.S. as &#39;Honor Lost:Love And Death In Modern Day Jordan&#39;) by a previously unknown author by the name of Norma Khouri,a woman from Jordan,who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend Dalia,due to the fact that Dalia,being from a devout Muslim background,was dating a Christian man. It,like Irving&#39;s biography on Hughes was revealed as a potential hoax. Australian film maker,Anna Broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was Khouri&#39;s attempts to clear herself of the lie(s). Over the time frame of 104 minutes,the film attempts to reveal is Norma Khouri telling the truth,or is she just a compulsive liar,with an agenda/vendetta of her own?. Interview footage with those who know/knew her (including an ex husband,her publisher,and others) tell their side of the story. This is a toothsome,well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties. Not rated,but contains pervasive bad language &amp; a re-enactment of the grisly murder scene,played over a few times (but nothing nearly as graphic &amp; disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic,such as Saw:Part 84). Not a good choice for the little ones.&#34;,
   &#34;Intelligent, stylish, and compelling thriller from the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim&#39;s son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dressed to Kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense. The finale and conclusion are especially &#39;nightmarish&#39;.It&#39;s a truly edge of your seat shocker. Even more impressive though is De Palma&#39;s elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film, but mainly in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. Nancy Allen&#39;s performance as an involved street-walker is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many criticize De Palma&#39;s films for having Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. But any similarities between Hitchcocks works and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality, as calling this film a &#39;rip-off&#39; would be degrading to a fine thriller. Dressed to Kill is a must see for all cinema fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** out of ****&#34;,
   &#34;You&#39;d be forgiven to think a Finnish director from Helsinki would be no good at directing an American horror movie (especially one entirely located inside a US prison) - see this to prove yourself wrong! It was produced in the 80&#39;s after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern DIY company TV advert (something I think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to $100m+ budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind!) being Mr Harlin&#39;s first major production and the - at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar - cast. I still think most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with Stellan Stargaard&#39;s screen appearances (not mentioning the well overrated Mr(s) Bergman directorial efforts) - at least for all female viewers - but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the US and Hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense. Do try and watch this movie even if you&#39;re not a horror puff, IMO it&#39;s definitely worth it!&#34;,
   &#34;I disagree with previous comment about this movie. I think it was cute and fun and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter. You don&#39;t have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool. You can be smart and pretty and classy all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the cast was good and the story was fine for the target audience. All-in-all my wife, daughter (10) and I each thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. It also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original Nancy Drew mysteries which I am sure she will love much as I loved the Hardy Boys. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. I can&#39;t think of a better outcome for that movie than rekindling interest in that classic series.&#34;,
   &#34;Kazan&#39;s early film noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate it very highly. I can almost see where they are coming from. But I prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a long-forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi-documentary fashion. Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to apprehend the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime equals disease, and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (post WWII through the early 1950s) and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher. For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end. It is something else, and frankly I don&#39;t know how they filmed some of it. I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie shows how savage the troubles really are. People who do not want to be involved have no say in the way their lives are altered. This movie shows how the people of Northern Ireland, both Catholic and Protestant are held captive. At any moment their lives may be changed forever whether they want to be involved or not.&#39;,
   &#34;I absolutely loved this show. I watched it from the time it first aired in the late 90&#39;s to the very last episode. In my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children. Yes things have changed a bit with Jo since we last saw her in the books, but it&#39;s still compelling with great stories and good lessons. The actress that portrays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort) Throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between Jo and Nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn. I recommend this show to anyone.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie, even though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving, strong film. Bette Davis, as the slutty, vicious Cockney waitress Mildred is absolutely believable. Watching her performance is still spellbinding. She makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time. Leslie Howard\&#39;s performance as the weak, obsessed Phillip Carey is not as strong, but I don\&#39;t see how any actor could hold their own against Ms. Davis\&#39;s performance. She chews up the scenery in every scene she is in, totally stealing the show. This is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the Academy Award, but lost. It was shocking for it\&#39;s day what with themes of unwed pregnancy, multiple sex partners, and Mildred\&#39;s vicious language so it is somewhat dated, but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she REALLY thinks of him (&#34;You cad, you dirty swine....&#34;) is still some of the greatest acting I have ever seen on film.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Gandhi as a husband and father?&#34; has always been discussed by people in India. \&#39;Gandhi...my father\&#39; is a story that only a few would have known to such details. Surely an insight into Gandhi\&#39;s personal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked the movie for story and cinematography. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna, and Shefali Shah have all done a good job. Most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers...commendable job. Traditional Indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what I didn\&#39;t quite like was the narration style. At several points, I found the tone over-dramatized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as &#34;must-watch-once&#34;. 8/10&#39;,
   &#34;This film had my heart pounding. The acting was great, the erotic music and the beautiful women add up to make this one a winner. The lead actress decides to join an escort service when she realizes that her husband has no time for her. She step&#39;s into a whole new world her first client being another woman. This is a film you definitely DON&#39;T want to pass up.&#34;,
   &#34;I watched this film a few times in the 90&#39;s and nearly split my sides laughing each time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is some thing else. He is SO funny. Even the P.C. brigade would find this hilarious. It&#39;s a must watch, and even better if you&#39;ve got the guys or girls in for a drink. The take off of Michael Jackson is so like him, if you close your eyes you believe it&#39;s him singing. The things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny. My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy.&#34;,
   &#39;One of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex Yu.Story is very familiar to people in ex Yul because generation after war used to live in the same way.People in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect people.The plot is in the 50&#34;,When Josip Broz Tito said no to the SSSR and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western influence.But,in a country were people didn\&#39;t had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was everything.The friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after 40 years of their emigration from Yu is still alive.They get together after all this years on Ester&#34;s funeral and they start to remember of their childhood,before their went to the emigration and become successful people.&#39;,
   &#39;A lot people get hung up on this films tag as a &#34;children\&#39;s film&#34;, and that it certainly is, though it is one made for adults. Takashi Miike uses the fantasy genre, particularly, the children\&#39;s fantasy genre, as a springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setup is simple a boy is selected to play the &#34;hero&#34; in this years annual festival, only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined. What follows is a hallucinatory, grotesque, whimsical, and often funny journey through the world of Japanese folklore, but wait there\&#39;s also an evil Villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world. However, the villain here, is not a mere demon, it is the demon-spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans &#34;use&#34; and &#34;discard&#34;. Usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate/resentment, the villain transforms the vibrant colorful Yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals(those whove played the video game, Sonic The Hedghog, might remember a certain Dr. Robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly\&#39;s who Sonic had to then &#34;liberate&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hero in this film is actually the least interesting character, essentially playing the straight man, in a world gone suddenly mad. Though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers, as do many of the Yokia themselves, who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots, some spirits being umbrellas with eyes, talking walls, or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans...of course in this magical world of Miike\&#39;s Yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children\&#39;s fantasy, as few, if any, of the characters are heroic, their victory being a combination of happenstance, almost arbitrary faith, and a desire to party. The Yokai spirits, only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout, after they mistake the end of the world invasion of Earth for a great Yokai festival, and even then only to dance and party. Also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all\&#39;s well that ends well fantasy ending, but with a final scene, showing our hero years older, with an adult job, now unable to see the Yokai spirits of his youth, who then despondently turn to the villain, who being a spirit can never really die. This ending, with it\&#39;s Yokai spirit who is the spitting image of Pokemon\&#39;s Pikachu, warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves, but of the horrors of over-consumption. The villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them(in Japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit), and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence, they become soulless vengeful machines, not unlike those seen in modern video games, suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die, but can become deformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the first scripts Miike has contributed to, and I believe it shows, as there\&#39;s a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness. Though I\&#39;ve focused mostly on the story (since lots of users here seem to write it off), I do want to say that visually it\&#39;s a kaleidescope of CGI, stop animation, costume, and live puppetry, that works remarkably well. There\&#39;s a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film, and the Miyazaki comparisons are warranted, as are the NeverEnding Story and Labrynth comparisons, though this film is sharper and more adult than either. The Yokai are beaten, brutalized, and turned into machines of living hate, who I believe even kill a few humans, a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening, while a sexual undercurrent, the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero, or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy, seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes, especially when considering this is a &#34;children\&#39;s film&#34;. However these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough, not to traumatize any children to bad. Grims fairy tales, before revisions, did much worse, far more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all this is one of Miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet, with enough visual drama and great performances(the Yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them, thats laugh out loud funny at times) to appeal to audiences of all ages, and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth. The latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them, but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood. Another beautiful, funny, and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn\&#39;t come close to his apex. Instant classic.&#39;,
   &#34;Good film. Tells a boyish fantasy story, telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently. Or at least the feeling: that you have to break every rule if you are to break one. If you wanted to express love for someone you don&#39;t know, how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation? Also it&#39;s about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life, of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats. What gives Disney or FOX or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice. Are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self. Do we have to listen to the NRJ shouting, see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee?&#34;,
   &#39;Half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in Finland. These stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard. This indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins with a bungy jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key. The film improves so stick with it. Two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief. The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the various scenes of family life take place in Finland, the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90-minute drama.&#39;,
   &#34;Put quite simply, this film is terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts off simply, looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t expect gore, or zombies. This is psychological, and just as he would also do in Candyman, Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time you watch this film, you realise more about what&#39;s happening, and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawings have never been scarier.&#34;,
   &#39;This is a film that was very well done. I had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release! Cheers to the director and all the actors. The supporting cast gave Eva Mendez what she needed to take this to the top. As everyone else here states, the latter portion of the film is riveting. Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with her character, being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made. She has quite the career ahead of her. I was amazed at her performance. I completely enjoyed the film, questioned my values in life and priorities, and am a better person for it! A great message lies within the film. Release it so all can enjoy!&#39;,
   &#39;One measurement for the greatness of a movie is, \&#39;if it came on t.v. right now, would you want to sit there and watch it again?\&#39; My answer for the Grand Canyon is as powerful a &#34;yes&#34; as it would be for nearly any movie I have ever seen. There are just so many powerful moments, such an intelligent and moving story, such incredible performances. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that were so rampant in the early nineties. But it also dramatically affirms the capacity of individuals to love, think and care. In a slight way, the movie was of its time. It partly portrays society as a balloon about to burst. Because the country was in a recession, and so void of leadership, this was true of that time. But the movie is also timeless. I think it could honestly stand up against any movie that has ever been made, and it is the most overlooked film of all time.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;The Garden of Allah&#34; was one of the first feature length, 3-strip Technicolor films. To correct a previous poster the first Technicolor feature (after Disney\&#39;s 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935\&#39;s &#34;Becky Sharp&#34; which was a costume drama that used the color for it\&#39;s garish color costumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Garden of Allah&#34; looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows. It must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life. Unfortunately, the film does not stand up to the cinematography. That being said, the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat.&#39;,
   &#39;I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The town where Jerry\&#39;s market was. I remember my whole family going out to watch the filming. I remember a guy showing the &#34;Blob&#34; to me and my brothers in a bucket. I also would like to share that my mother was in the movie. Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsaut\&#39;s and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some shots from behind. They payed her $25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past August. My mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister.&#39;,
   &#39;Ronald Colman plays a famous Broadway actor who has begun to lose his mind and sense of identity. After years of playing a wide range of parts, he can\&#39;t remember who he exactly is--who are his roles and who is the self. And, much more serious, he begins to see and hear his play even in regular everyday life. So, since he\&#39;s currently playing in &#34;Othello&#34;, he begins to act jealous and suspicious--just like the title character. Ultimately, it leads him to the depths of insanity and murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this film years ago and liked it. I just saw it again and loved it. Now perhaps some of my enthusiasm is because I have always liked Ronald Colman and this is a great triumph for him--and for which he earned the Best Actor Oscar. And, looking at the competition that year (Gregory Peck for GENTLEMAN\&#39;S AGREEMENT, John Garfield for BODY AND SOUL, William Powell for LIFE WITH FATHER and Michael Redgrave for MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA), I think Colman was a very good choice, as he stretched from his usual comfort zone and did a much more demanding role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I noticed that one reviewer hated this film because they hated Shakespeare--and this took up about half their review talking about their dislike for him. However, this film isn\&#39;t really about Shakespeare, and it doesn\&#39;t matter at all if you dislike Shakespeare. I am no huge fan of Shakespeare, but marveled at the small portions of the play that Colman re-enacted--though, as I said, this is NOT a really movie about Shakespeare. Instead, it\&#39;s a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality. It could have been ANY play, though &#34;Othello&#34; was an excellent choice because of the murder scene--which gets acted out for real later in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very clever film due to a lovely script--with some overtones of Film Noir. Fortunately, the acting was terrific also, as Colman had excellent support from Signe Hasso, Shelly Winters and Edmond O\&#39;Brien (who was particularly good--he played his part just right). And, considering the great George Cukor was directing, it\&#39;s no wonder it\&#39;s a wonderful film from start to finish.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m fan of ART, I like anything about Art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This movie shows it, so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint anything about Art, especially naked bodies, but she can\&#39;t do it because of her strict family (father), at the beginning of the movie she painted herself naked, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family didn\&#39;t let her paint naked men because it\&#39;s against the moral. Even so Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too, so at the ending he sacrifices his freedom for hers by lying. He said that he raped her, but it wasn\&#39;t true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says that she will suffer a lot, because in the trial in which Artemisia, her father and the Art teacher were, somebody was hurting her artistic hands to say the truth. I think this a great movie about ART, and an artistic love, It\&#39;s worth watching. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she acts very well, I also like her performance in &#34;The portrait of a lady&#34; as Pansy Osmond. 8.5/10&#39;,
   &#39;I have read modesty Blaise for several years now, collecting numbers of the strip. After the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book &#34;Modesty Blaise&#34; I was surprised the result got this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got was a movie not based on action or violence. The director had focused on history and psychology. How was Modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non-childhood. I think this thougths will give a greater understanding to the next (I hope) film. I simply loved the movies old-fashioned style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However everything wasn\&#39;t that good, the gambling wasn\&#39;t that good. almost boring and unreal. The acting could have been improved too. I\&#39;m not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt real, the only reason he was there was so Modesty could have someone to tell her story for. Also they could have expanded the movie, showing more about when she builds up &#34;The network&#34; but I\&#39;ll guess thats for the next movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And please forgive me for my bad English&#39;,
   &#34;I was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue, but was pleased to find a fast-paced script, an underlying moral, excellent portrayals from all the actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense, and beautiful cinematography--there&#39;s even a shot of the majestic stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic, before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work. All the supporting players round it out, and I do wonder who trained all those elephants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the stone-Buddha sequence, you really can discern that it&#39;s Vivien Leigh in the long shots. Her shape and the way she moves is distinct from Taylor&#39;s. The only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots, where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.&#34;,
   &#39;The Secret Fury, in many ways a run-of-the-mill romantic suspense drama (directed by Mel Ferrer) boasts top-notch principals in Colbert and Ryan; it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end, when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief -- as so often it does in this genre. But for some viewers the film\&#39;s highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy Leah by Vivian Vance -- the immortal Ethel Mertz on &#34;I Love Lucy.&#34; Oddly, Vance had very few film roles; her true home was Broadway, where (among other gigs) she understudied for Ethel Merman. Here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme; watch her half-heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she\&#39;s puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotel\&#39;s linen-storage room -- a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty.&#39;,
   &#39;Five years on from the Tenko survivors returning home, and from Marion\&#39;s double-edged &#34;Well that\&#39;s that&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s now 1950: reunion time. The gang\&#39;s all here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is a beaut: as perfectly written and acted, and as thought-provoking and moving, as the original series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here. From Marion\&#39;s family to Joss\&#39;s health centre, everything has changed in five years, and not everything has changed for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trip to Dominica\&#39;s plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge-of-the-seat tension. There\&#39;s a real sense of tragedy and disaster as, once again, fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colours, and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lush location filming in Singapore, and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It\&#39;s such a shame that this really is the end. I could watch it all over again. Perfection.&#39;,
   &#39;This is a great movie but there could be more about Soylent Green. There should be more scenes of what they do to people. How people act in 2022. I think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year 2022 and beyond. Even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie. So go rent or buy this movie right NOW!!&#39;,
   &#39;This film is one of those nostalgia things with me and I never REALLY expect anyone else to &#34;get it&#34; but am pleased when I recommend it and somebody DOES enjoy it. My late father HATED Arthur Askey but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for &#34;The Ghost Train&#34; and &#34;Old Ted \&#39;Olmes&#34; transferred to me as a child. Years later, I watch it every now and again, enjoying the familiarity. I always wonder if it will not be quite the same but I am never disappointed in it. There is much to enjoy. The sequence on the train is truly inspired when Askey and Murdoch proceed to annoy the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole section in the station is amazing with so much going on you have to keep up. Yes, it is dated and full of wartime Britishness in accents and plot (based on the original play by Arnold Ridley of Dad\&#39;s Army fame!) but full of wonderful character performances - including Kathleen Harrison as a dotty spinster. The atmosphere is truly as near sinister as an Arthur Askey vehicle could get. This is available cheap as chips in the UK on DVD so treat yourself. It is a perfect Saturday/Sunday morning or any day lazy afternoon lightweight piece of entertainment. I Thank You....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD MOVIES CAN BE GOOD MOVIES!&#39;,
   &#34;This stylistically sophisticated visual game presents \x91a story within a story&#39;. The protagonist is scriptwriter Bart Klever who fights persistently with his new text \x96 which is, at the same time, the screenplay of the film we&#39;re watching. In the movie Bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the film\x85 Bart&#39;s struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme, as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space, light, colours and a couple of cats. The outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text continually influenced by the filmmaker&#39;s interventions, which appears on a computer monitor and serves as a counterpoint to the similarity mutable environment. The constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions which arise: What is \x91truth&#39; and what \x91illusion&#39; ? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest? Can anything serve as a basic orientation point in the narrative space?&#34;,
   &#39;Expecting to see another Nunsploitation movie with a mean Mother Superior abusing and torturing her charges, Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I had anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually has a feminist storyline, though I don\&#39;t think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set. It certainly wasn\&#39;t practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society. Throughout the story, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can\&#39;t sit there any longer and actually does something about it, albeit with disastrous results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pre-credit sequence has Flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. She sees an injured &#34;evil&#34; Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to assist him. Before she can, her hate-filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face (great family dynamics, huh?). After this, her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice. Though scenes do involve violence, rape and nuns, I would consider this more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there, but the acting, camera-work, storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level. Most &#34;nun&#34; films I\&#39;ve seen usually have the basic premise of: A good girl somehow winds up in a convent, where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-spirited (but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me, but it\&#39;s a lot easier for guys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as their liberators (of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim invader, that impales dear Sister Agatha. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Agatha\&#39;s death that sends Flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her... Her father treats her like dirt. Her Muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time. I don\&#39;t want to give out too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened at the conclusion. This is a great film, so don\&#39;t be put off by its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epic. Plus, how on Earth could a movie featuring Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I am not familiar with María Casares\&#39; other works, but Sister Agatha is a hell of a character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read many great reviews of the Synapse (US) release, but I love my German X-Rated Kult DVD copy. It isn\&#39;t anamorphic/16:9, but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than Synapse\&#39;s release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are also many great, wise or funny lines of dialogue (many from Sister Agatha)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Why is God male? The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\x85 They\&#39;re all male!&#34; -Flavia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;These men are afraid- look at them, Sister- Afraid their power will be taken away from them!&#34; -Sr. Agatha (regarding Christians fleeing after the Muslims arrive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Woman, where are you going? The Moslems can do nothing to you that the Christians haven\&#39;t done! Ha Ha Ha!&#34; -Sr. Agatha (to a group of fleeing Christian women)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Lord bless these Moslems- For putting fear into these pompous Christians.&#34; -Flavia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Does it take the mere sight of a Moslem to make you $h!t your underclothing?&#34; -Sr. Agatha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closing message: &#34;Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a runaway nun. The idea for the film came from events which occurred during the Musalman invasions of Italy culminating in what even today is remembered as THE MARTYRDOM OF THE 800 AT OTRANTO&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;This is a great British film. A cleverly observed script with many quotable lines, which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend. As per usual Phil Daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and Gary Stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, i think it will find an audience outside of this, purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t-shirt. also A great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This really could be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies. Like the weed in the Welsh fields: it&#39;s a grower!&#34;,
   &#39;Although this show has been off the air since 1973, after viewing a DVD set I borrowed at our library, I felt compelled to say a bit about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there would be a little &#34;Sunday Night Party&#34; with friends to watch this on NBC on one of the few color televisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy history not so much for the names and dates but how it influences us today and how so much can be so profound based on the most inconsequential actions of the time. Case in point: Virginia City, Nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world because of the silver, got its name from a character named &#34;Old Virginny&#34;, who, in the town\&#39;s early days, stumbled out of a saloon, fell and broke his whiskey bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Virginny didn\&#39;t want to waste the occasion so as the precious liquid was seeping into the dirt he decided to christen the town &#34;Virginia Town&#34;. The area became known as the Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had the reputation of trying to jump everyone\&#39;s claim and the area became known as the Comstock Lode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just watched an early episode that dealt with these 2 subjects. Other episodes dealt with Mark Twain\&#39;s literary rise while a reporter for the Territorial Enterprise...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was wholesome (and frequently educational) family entertainment. As someone else remarked, each episode would really be considered a movie in its own right - rich scripts and characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing it twisted the truth on was the proximity to Virginia City and the Ponderosa. In truth, to ride from the Ponderosa (all of Northern Lake Tahoe), one would have to ride his horse about 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) down the Spooner Summit to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) of the Carson Valley then another 30-40 miles to Virginia city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say the Cartwrights would have some sore rear ends doing this on a regular basis. But every writer should have some leeway with the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I miss that show, even today.&#39;,
   &#39;Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn\&#39;t have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it\&#39;s just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And let\&#39;s not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone\&#39;s imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. &#34;I\&#39;ll never let go, Jack.&#34; Titanic is a great film down to it\&#39;s very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.&#39;,
   &#39;I would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of Season 10! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final episode of the 10th season &#34;Unending&#34;, where (it would certainly appear that) the Asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion, left me in disbelief! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the extremely rushed end of the series, it\&#39;s obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season. My guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-DVD moves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless the Asgard return in a future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the &#34;apparent&#34; extinction), I think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.&#39;,
   &#39;It is an excellent thriller from Turkey which can make sense.Great job from Gokbakar brothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all,i want to point on screen play.Generally screen play in most films from Turkey is not enough,but GEN has the best shots to be said &#34;perfect&#34;.And also transition parts are really excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand,&#34;Gen&#34; has a great topic that influence everyone.Especially,a woman ,who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium ,has a mother that is a habitual insanity.Principal causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen.The only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an impressive aggression part Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar played.This performance may be more realistic than &#34; Irréversible(Monica Bellucci) &#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing i want to say is &#34;Watch this movie,you\&#39;ll get confused&#34;&#39;,
   &#39;A film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker. The fact is, Steven Spielberg, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years. THE COLOR PURPLE, at the time, was considered risky, especially after action classics like JAWS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. In hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for Spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in E.T. Critics called COLOR PURPLE his entrance into intellectual fare. It is quite an entrance. No special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by Alice Walker. One surprise is how Spielberg could present such a moving film about African-Americans in the deep south. Slavery is gone, but in the south depicted here, it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience. This is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations. It is the first in a line of films people either didn\&#39;t see or wouldn\&#39;t see because there are no aliens. EMPIRE OF THE SUN, ALWAYS, SCHINDLER\&#39;S LIST, etc.. His awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because A) he uses mostly untrained, first-time actors, B) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen, and C) it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years. It is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single Academy Award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoopi Goldberg is fabulous as the tortured Celie, an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive Danny Glover, who she only knows as &#34;Mister&#34;. The film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with &#34;Mister&#34;. The PG-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the Walker novel. This is not &#34;The Burning Bed&#34; in Georgia by any means. There is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected. It happens gracefully. Goldberg perfectly plays a human being, someone in need of love and someone who deserves it. The films\&#39; most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when Goldberg and her sister, Nettie (played by Akosua Busia) are separated, maybe forever. (Possibly foreshadowing Holocaust separation of child and parent?) You may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people. There really is something to live for, but love triumphs over all. Spielberg bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING: 10 of 10&#39;,
   &#39;When I first heard about the title, I thought of \&#39;The Simpsons\&#39;, just like so many other reviewers, but when I saw the cast, I was completely stunned, that so many great character-actors would actually be in this! First of all, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), who plays the title character, McBain. He is rescued from a Vietnam POW-camp by some of his buddies, one of which is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yanks), who splits a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL with McBain (Vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently), and tells him that he can re-do the favor to him, if he ever gets into trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) join the rebels in Colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails the mission, Christina goes to McBain for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McBain then asks his good ol\&#39; Vietnam buddies to help him. First there\&#39;s the token tough black guy, Eastland, played by &#34;American Ninja&#34;\&#39;s Steve James, who was also in director James Glickenhaus\&#39; previous movie, &#34;The Exterminator&#34;, where the exterminator\&#39;s real name also was Eastland, coincidence? I think not. There is also a lot of other references to The Exterminator, among other things, the most notable one being that McBain himself wears a welders-mask when Christina sees him for the first time, when he is working on a welding-job on top of a bridge! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other guys in the Vietnam-pack are: The rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and then there\&#39;s the doc, Dalton, (played by Jay Patterson, who doesn\&#39;t look like the guy the IMDb is linking to, and I haven\&#39;t seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there\&#39;s the cop, Gill, who has had enough of his unsatisfying job, he\&#39;s played by Thomas G. Waites, who some of us might remember from The Warriors and The Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in other big roles, we find Luis Guzmán (Boogie Nights, Carlito\&#39;s Way), as a small-time drug-dealer who can\&#39;t get a decent job. Also, there is Dick Boccelli as the drug-dealing kingpin who gets hung up in a crane on top of a roof by the McBain-gang, almost Exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat-grinder by John Eastland in the EXTERMINATOR-movie! Now, I haven\&#39;t seen Glickenhaus\&#39; &#34;Shakedown/Blue Jean Cop&#34; yet, but I\&#39;m almost ready to bet half a hundred-dollar bill that Boccelli gets hung up in that movie too! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, back to the plot of this movie.. they go off to Colombia and saves the day, yay! But who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is great, and the action-scenes are very well done, and you\&#39;re never bored while watching this movie! Highly recommended to all action-lovers!&#39;,
   &#39;Short synopsis &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men. One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses. Later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the Christmas holidays. Hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival (during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids, so it is really serious). With exposed, well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape \x96 only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women. One gets caught, the other remains free and is not given away by his companion. A last encounter, a last light for a cigarette, adieu l\&#39;ami, farewell, friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters, played by classical he-man superstars Alain Delon and Charles Bronson. They are obviously attracted to each other, their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout. The whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow, a little like Deliverance. It is also very stylish. The safe the two men want to crack is in a \x96 for the time \x96 ultra modern glass and aluminum tower. It is the seat of a publicity firm, so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around. The wardrobe is also very good. The ultra stylish Citroen DS (maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times) features large in this movie \x96 perhaps a subtle kind of product placement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this movie for the actor\&#39;s performances alone. Delon and Bronson are really sharing the top billing, in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting. Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics. I have never seen Bronson better than here, he really acts - and speaks French throughout, with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed. And it is certainly the man himself we hear. (So the French language version is highly recommended). The police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite Franch character actors, Bernard Fresson who was Gene Hackman\&#39;s partner in French Connection II. He is the best brainy police inspector I know. Also very good is former child actress Brigitte Fossey as the young ingénue who, as it turns out, is not so Innocent as it first seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who expects the \x84old in-an-out&#34; of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film. For those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience, full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks, although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate. It has good acting, lots of gore, and a decent plot. One will be reminded of movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It&#39;s obvious that the budget was not all that big, but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors, which seems to be lacking in a lot of today&#39;s big budget special effects-filled films. The film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the film&#39;s length is a bit short. In addition, it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel, which would be very interesting as well. So grab some popcorn, turn down the lights and enjoy this one.&#34;,
   &#34;&#39;The Mother&#39; is that extraordinary piece of film making - it gets you thinking, it pulls no punches - and ultimately it leaves you thinking. Very much open-ended as to the lead character&#39;s fate. Anne Reid (which I only knew briefly from her appearances in some Victoria Wood-led projects and thought a fine comedienne) is truly superb here. Not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all. And not all that free-spirited and adventurous at first. She plays her character just with the right note that rings true (well, it did to me). Powerful cast. Great script. Renaissance of European cinema indeed ;)&#34;,
   &#39;One of my favorite films for a number of years was &#34;Last Action Hero&#34;; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician; so now I can\&#39;t bear any film he may had a hand in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adventures of Jake Speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in Last...Hero; so I was pleased to find it on DVD, so I could watch these themes played out so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the &#34;plot-within-the-plot&#34; involving white slavery during an African nation\&#39;s civil war, this is not an action movie. The plot that the &#34;plot-within-a-plot&#34; is within, is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve: Is Jake Speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader; or is he actually a fictional character (which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels)? I suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are perfectly aware of this. The film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional &#34;adventure-story&#34; universe. That\&#39;s actually a rich theme, the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film\&#39;s amiable and campy sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are weaknesses to the film - primarily it\&#39;s cinematography, which makes the film look like a TV show. And the pacing does sag on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I really like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure they live, however silly. And I just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds up under multiple viewings -m good show!&#39;,
   &#34;Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy films have very, very little plot. Instead, they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious! Films such as HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house. Here in DIRTY WORK, most of the film is akin to these other two films--Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying (quite unsuccessfully) to clean a crazy professor&#39;s chimney. Seeing Ollie fall through the chimney, the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of Stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in an odd twist, there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie. It seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. Late in the film, you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg! Given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room, is it any surprise what happens next? While this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough. What worked exceptionally well was the middle portion. Give the boys nothing exciting to do and you&#39;ll be amazed at the hilarious results. One of the team&#39;s better films and it almost earns a 9.&#34;,
   &#34;Child &#39;Sexploitation&#39; is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and I feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience. After having seen both &#39;Trade&#39; and &#39;Holly&#39;, one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws. The other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not believe that turning this issue into a Hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I must commend the makes of &#39;Holly&#39; for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure. &#39;Trade&#39; wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts. I found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause. If I had wanted a cheap laugh I would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something I would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of &#39;Holly&#39;.&#34;,
   &#39;Kiera Nightly moved straight from the P&amp;P set to this action movie... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically. A great success in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen\&#39;s classic, she is, once again, &#34;having a go&#34;. Just as her bikini clad warrier woman in King Arthur was more skin than muscle, it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life... but then this is exactly what Domino Harvey (the real one) did, and I (being one of Nightly\&#39;s biggest fans) believe she carries if off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuff....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* 90210 (for the non American world) is the post code of Beverly hills in LA, where all the film stars live. * Domino Harvey father\&#39;s mostfamous film was Manchurian Candidate (which appears in the film). * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in June 2005, after having been arrested for drug dealing. She had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film. * Kiera Knightly alludes to Domino Harvey\&#39;s sexuality in her interview with Lucy Liu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find this film a bit far fetched, then check out Domino Harvey, as the facts are more amazing than the fiction.&#39;,
   &#39;I have watched this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it is that enjoyable. And it is quite scary, but all in good, ghoulish fun. A woman kills her 2nd husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged Santa Claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment. Mary Traynor, who I seem to remember from SNL or some other TV comedy skit show, is the evil wife, and Larry Drake plays the lunatic in the dingy Santa outfit. I had forgotten Santa was played by Drake over the years. His Santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times. You can probably guess how Santa finally gets into the house. The episode is played for laughs, but it also can be pretty intense at times.&#39;,
   &#34;Such a film of beauty that it&#39;s hard to describe. Maybe it&#39;s the absence of superfluous dialogue, or maybe it&#39;s the absolutely stellar soundtrack, or maybe it&#39;s just Meena Mumari&#39;s feet, but it&#39;s a joy to watch this movie again and again. I&#39;ve never seen another Indian movie that comes close to it, and few from any country rival its perfection.&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;m a big fan of Morgan Freeman. &#39;The Shawshank Redemption&#39; ranks at the top of my all-time favorite movies. But I have to admit that I have often wondered about his choice of roles. So many of his titles were big budget clichés with no heart. &#39;10 Items Or Less&#39; for me marks the return of Freeman to a role that truly showcases his considerable acting talents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freeman plays an unnamed, formerly big time Hollywood actor who hasn&#39;t worked in several years. He has been offered a part in an unspecified indi picture for which he is doing some research at a grocery store in a poor neighborhood in LA. After being stranded there by his flaky driver, Freeman is offered a ride home by checkout girl Scarlet (Paz Vega), whom he has semi-befriended. Before she can take him home, however, Scarlet has a big job interview she needs to get to, and Freeman agrees to tag along in exchange for the ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie follows Scarlet and Freeman to several locations, but the movie is really just a character piece about the interactions between the two. Freeman is the quintessential disconnected Hollywood type who hasn&#39;t heard of Target, and doesn&#39;t know his own telephone number or even what day of the week it is. He spouts wisdom from the Dalai Lama filtered thru his &#39;the whole world is but a stage&#39; mentality, and repeatedly calls Scarlet&#39;s job interview an &#39;audition&#39;. And yet he has a way with people, a way of affecting them that extends beyond his fame. He is a fan of humanity. He studies them, asks incessant questions about them, and delights in their quirks where others would simply be annoyed. In Scarlet, he sees the stubborn, proud loner that he was; he sees the man he used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlet, for her part, displays a fierce pride and sharp tongue that serve to hide her own insecurities about herself. Vega plays the role with a connection to Freeman that skates the line between an almost daughterly love and physical attraction, although she plays it beautifully and it&#39;s not at all as creepy as it sounds. But even as she feels her connection to Freeman grow, Scarlet has a keen eye for the reality of their different worlds and cuts thru Freeman&#39;s Hollywood bull*hit with a sharp pragmatism that refuses to accept anything but the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is smart, funny, and well written, with dialogue that is simple but effective. I read one IMDb review that said the lines were &#39;stilted&#39;, which I think is a misinterpretation of realistic human speech. There are no big soliloquies here, no deep soul searching moments. And so the trick is, I think, to show how people in ordinary, everyday life can forge connections with one another. And I think Freeman and Vega pull it off beautifully, painting a picture of a bond between two people that glitters like sun on the ocean, ethereal and elusive. Long after it&#39;s gone it lives on in your memories, tantalizing you with what might have been. OK, that was a bit flowery, but I really did like the performances and the movie. I would definitely recommend it.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie was a fantastic comedy. It had a lot of comedians star in it like Akshay Kumar,Rajpal Yadav,Paresh Raval and John Abraham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars wife and so were all the air hostesses. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia).

   &#39;Melissa Joan Hart shines! This show is amazing!! There is no match. Except for maybe Melissa in Clarissa Explains it All. She was marvelous in that, too. This is SO much better than Buffy, the Vampire Slayer. This show is WONDERFUL!&#39;,
   &#34;Hi:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about lost from a co-worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. Well I watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so I tuned it out. After a few years I stumbled upon lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow was I surprised. Can you say gravity well, damn I got sucked in. The pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward/backs are so so with the lamer characters, but over all good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin &amp; Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack&#39;s dad. Jack and Michael definitely are immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step above them, Juliet was way more classy than Kate. Mr. Eko way under-rated and on the level of Charlie if not more, too bad they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a genuine curiosity. As a whole great, very layered series: looking for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regards&#34;,
   &#34;Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my name is Jessica, i&#39;m Italian!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some time ago I have seen this film : &#39; For the very first time&#39;, with Corin Corky Nemec. It was the story of Micheal and Mary Margaret. I need to know the title of the song of the most important love scene in Micheal&#39;s bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Italy this film hasn&#39;t been programmed for many years and I don&#39;t know how to find the song. A lot of thanks for who can help me! I love this film! Is Very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica&#34;,
   &#34;This movie maybe really bad, but it is alot of fun. The bad acting and poor direction enhance the film&#39;s hystericalness. The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you go into this film expecting the first Conan or Excalibur, than you will hate it. If you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good, dumb fun you will have a good time. Watch for the scene where they try to hang the brothers, its funniest scene in the film. I wish Mystery Science Theatre 3000 would have done this!!&#34;,
   &#34;An excellent family movie... gives a lot to think on... There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong in this film. Everything is just perfect. The script is great - it&#39;s so... real... such things could happen in everyone&#39;s life. And don&#39;t forget about acting - it&#39;s just awesome! Just look at Frankie and You&#39;ll know what I thought about... This picture is a real can&#39;t-miss!!!&#34;,
   &#39;While watching this movie I was frustrated and distracted and by the end, I wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on. Even my A.D.D couldn\&#39;t keep up. It felt like a slight acid trip. Everything looked flat, there was no dimension to anything. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie mid-way and smash my burned copy of this movie. But after I finish watching it, I went online to read up on the movie and I should have done a little research into this movie before watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Secret of Kells is loosely based on the true story about the original Book of Kells. A small boy, Brendan, is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written. This book will contain information that will help &#34;change darkness into light.&#34; Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls. Taking place in the 8th century, Brendan\&#39;s uncle, the Abbot of Kells, is trying to build the wall to keep the Vikings out. Brendan\&#39;s uncle insist he help complete the wall, but a traveler and keeper of &#34;the book&#34; secretly trains Brendan to hone in on his illustration skills, and convinces him to complete &#34;the book&#34; and carry out it\&#39;s word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire time I watched the movie I thought I was missing something because I didn\&#39;t really understand what was going on. I figured I was just missing a piece of Irish history. A simple Google search taught me all I needed to know about the original Book of Kells. After reading many articles, my opinion of the movie greatly changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Book of Kells is a copied version of the first few books of the New Testament transcribed into Latin by Gaelic monks in Ireland in the 8th century. Along with it\&#39;s paleographic and insular script, the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art, a type of early art form know for it\&#39;s intricacy, complexity, and miniature illustrations. Much of the art in the Book of Kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time, flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective. But what makes the Book of Kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it\&#39;s use of many colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Secret of Kells is very colorful. I originally thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminded me a lot of the cartoon Samurai Jack which also had a flat and &#34;amine&#34; look to it. Once I learned about the art styles of the Book of Kells, it\&#39;s obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie. There are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit Brendan\&#39;s mind. Whenever he goes into his imagination, circular shapes resembling the sun, cogs, clocks and wheels begin filling the screen. The edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles. Transitions are filled with color, and Celtic knots. From the trees to the floors, many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clocking in at 70 minutes minus credits, The Secret of Kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people (maybe just children) interested. I think one has to generally be open-mined to The Secret of Kells as half art piece, half movie about history. Despite looking like it was animated with Adobe illustrator, It\&#39;s a very nice looking movie. But based on the 20 films submitted for Oscar consideration, I don\&#39;t think it was worth being nominated over Mary and Max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com&#39;,
   &#39;This is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it, it has lot\&#39;s of laughs, guns, action, crime,, good one liners, and a decent plot, with an over the top, Donald Sutherland in a rather comedic role as an Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too, Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this as the lead character &#34;Max&#34; a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV, plays the bad guy,, &#34;Livingston&#34;. The plot centers around Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies, throw into the mix the Assassain Sutherland, who pretty much has all the good one liners, this is the perfect crime caper, there is the usual love story,, but played very differently than you would think by Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian mafia, Italian Mafia, and Chineese Mafia here thrown into the mix,, the film is shot in Boston,, where you have some great shots , and locals,, great photography and music in this film, this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy,, it has everything that one could ever want. Check out Sutherland\&#39;s toilet in a particular scene,, very unusual. this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me.&#39;,
   &#39;I simply love this movie. It is a perfect example of the well-rounded surprising stories that come out of Asian cinema. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply awful Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully acted. The Hollywood version is the exact opposite. I was aghast when I first saw the trailer for the remade US Version and who was starring in it. It\&#39;s typical Hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it\&#39;s worst. The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon. The ONLY reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the US audience\&#39;s aversion to subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the main reasons this movie would never work in an American telling is that the reserved, ultra socially conservative character of the public Japanese persona is at issue in this movie. Certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance, but half of the movie\&#39;s tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please try to see this movie in it\&#39;s original form, not the terrible full screen. And please DO skip the US remake....it\&#39;s a shallow travesty in comparison to the original Japanese movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know the &#34;original&#34; movie is much older, and this is simply a Japanese take on the story, but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new US remake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of foreign films, I\&#39;ll make a few quick recommendations: 1.Monsoon Wedding-I list this first for a reason, outstanding film! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian mistaken identity flic! 3.Shiri-A Korean action pic that mixes both Asian flare &amp; US style plot 4.Run Lola Run-A German film that integrates it\&#39;s techno score ingeniously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, just a quick list anyway :-)&#39;,
   &#39;I saw this movie being a Jane Austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels: well, this transposition is simply accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Emma&#34; is one of Austen\&#39;s most delightful and funny novels, thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters. The movie respected this subtle irony, not disregarding the comic element (Miss Bates above all). What engaged me in the novel, and the movie renders it clearly, is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist, and the modern look with which women, men, and their relation are handled, and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century, who lived almost a secluded life, could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did: that most and still fascinates me. We can feel this modernity throughout the movie: just replace costumes, and use a more current language but the situations, the feelings, the ideas would be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in other people\&#39;s lives, or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women\&#39;s relations, and still the difficulty in revealing, and giving expression to one\&#39;s feelings, especially love: every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (nowadays she would be probably too mature for it), Toni Colette is simply great. And how I envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then, the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension... a really enjoyable and deserving movie.&#39;,
   &#39;The most succinct way to describe Ride With The Devil is with but one word: authenticity. I will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film, but I would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding &#34;bleeding Kansas&#34;. Yes there were liberties taken on the actual events, as all fiction is apt to do. But the overall feel of the film is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no PC hindsight here) even the actors look authentic.Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small part in the film) looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few viewers I talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog. They cannot believe that 19th century farmers would &#34;talk like poets&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they don\&#39;t realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness, the American public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch. These people were raised on Shakespeare and the King James version of the Bible. The screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging from documentation of the time. The stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in addition to a historical document, this film works on a visceral level as well. Beautifully photographed and performed, it harkens back to the days of the great western epics. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, done so many times before in so many other, lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict.This film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like American Beauty, this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system. But I am certain that Ride With The Devil will be given it\&#39;s due in the coming years. Please rent this film. You will not be disappointed.&#39;,
   &#34;Action, horror, sci-fi, exploitation director Fred Olen Ray shows he has some talent as a director. Character actor William Smith is one of the best tough/bad guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career. As for Randy Travis he gives his best Lee Van Cleef impression. He&#39;s not bad in the film. Smith and Travis make the movie. As for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out. Ray did a great job directing this flick, Smith and Travis were good, I&#39;d give this B western on a scale of one to ten(ten being the best) a seven.&#34;,
   &#39;This time around, Blackadder is no longer royal(or even particularly close to being any such thing)... instead, rather a butler to the Prince Regent, portrayed by Hugh Laurie(who replaces Tim McInnerny, who presence is sorely missed, and that hole is never filled... his character had an innocent charm... while he was a bumbling and complete moron, we can\&#39;t help but care for him, which isn\&#39;t at all true of his replacement) as being intolerably daft(which he apparently was, according to the Trivia page), not to mention loud-mouthed and utterly non-threatening. Edmund can now do just about what he pleases, and does so. Why is he so frustrated and angry(honestly, it gets depressing at times)? Yes, his master is a buffoon, they always are. He doesn\&#39;t seem to lack money, nor is he in any danger. In the second series, the Queen was mischievous and childish, and would cut off someone\&#39;s head - or marry them - on a whim. Here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting. There is still commentary and even a little satire. Too often, it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own, so they merely restate it, not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags. And I can\&#39;t tell you how many of them I figured out before they were done, literally more than a minute away. It\&#39;s not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered. Baldrick doesn\&#39;t change from last season... he\&#39;s still rather pathetic and stupid, leading to &#34;silly&#34; humor. Frankly, the amount goes through the roof. Don\&#39;t get me started on the gross-out stuff. The sarcastic, verbal wit can still be great, though much less of it is than before. I\&#39;d say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny, while the other three didn\&#39;t really get me into them at all. I was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were... I could see many of such coming a mile away. Some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced. This continues with the tradition started by &#34;II&#34; of letting the plans work out occasionally. The theme is the worst of the bunch, the credits sequences the least creative. All in all, this is, by far, my least favorite of the four. I recommend it to fans of the franchise and of British comedy in general. 7/10&#39;,
   &#34;After &#39;&#39;Empire strikes back&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Return of the Jedi&#39;&#39; is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke went to Tattoine to save Han Solo from Jabba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is doing in secret, the construction of a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station stays totally constructed, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient because of the delay of the new Death Star,and they need to kill many of their commanders to have the project made in schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R2 and C3po are inside Jabba&#39;s palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba,where Lukes pretends to negotiate Han&#39;s life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiation,since he is using Han Solo as a piece of his palace&#39;s decoration.(Han still is frozen in carbonite) Lando is hidden as Jabba&#39;s guard and Chewbacca is also gave to Jabba by a reward hunter. When the same Hunter tries to save Han solo and makes him stay in human form again, we see that is actually princess Leia in a disguise. The problem is that Jabba discovers Leia&#39;s plan and takes her as his slave,while Han is thrown away in Chewbacca&#39;s cell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke comes as a Jedi knight to rescue his friends. At his first try to kill Jabba,he falls into Jabba&#39;s monster cell (Bantha),but easily kills it. Jabba stays angry and decides to thrown Han,Chewbacca and Luke to Sarlacc, a big creature from the desert who stays 1.000 years digesting it&#39;s &#39;food&#39;. Luke,Han and Chewie has success in scape again, and even Boba Fett dies when Han accidentally throws him in to Sarlacc&#39;s mouth. Leia kills Jabba and goes after Han,Luke and Chewie as well c3po and R2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody&#39;s safe again,Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi,as well his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick, since he already has 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda says to Luke that he does not need more training,but to really be a Jedi, he must fight with Vader again. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke&#39;s dad, and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks to Luke to remember his advices about the temptation of the dark side, and to Luke transmit his Jedi knowledge to other people. When Yoda dies,Obi wan&#39;s spirit shows up to Luke and tells him that Luke&#39;s father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since he became a sith. Luke stays worried about killing his own dad, and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia, and says the reasons why Luke and Leia were separated since babies. He gives his last advice to Luke saying that if he refuses to kill Vader, the emperor will win the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, the Emperor says to Vader that he must give Luke to him when he shows up, since Luke is stronger than before, and they both needs to combine their efforts to bring Luke to the dark side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we are going to have one of the best battles from the star war series,when the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, the &#39;&#39; Death Star 2&#39;&#39;, Luke will confront Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and chewie needs to turn off the &#39;Death star 2&#39; power field, with the help of the EWOKS. (little creatures who looks little bears)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is for sure one of the most exciting star wars of all!&#34;,
   &#39;As a child I always hated being forced to sit through musicals. I never understood why people would break out into song like that, and I was far too young to appreciate the artistry (choreography, set design, costumes, pacing) behind it all. Carol Reed\&#39;s &#34;Oliver!&#34; was the one musical I remember oddly enjoying as a child, probably because it is one of the darker ones and is appropriately drenched in the spirit of Dickensian squalor. This is a musical about ghetto life in Victorian London, and while the scenery and set designs are stark, dark, and true to that way of life, it is flat out bizarre for people to be breaking out into such ridiculous songs amidst their misery. Upon a recent viewing, my first since childhood, I have some new thoughts and insights into why this musical &#34;works&#34; in that bizarre breaking out into song kind of way, and why most just don\&#39;t do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When musicals work or really say something, it is because they realize their own inherent strangeness. Lars von Trier\&#39;s &#34;Dancer in the Dark&#34; as tragic and operatic and over reaching as it was, worked as a musical because the musical numbers were the products of the imagination of the protagonist, an immigrant obsessed with Hollywood musicals. Likewise, the very cynical and enjoyable &#34;Chicago&#34; worked on a similar level because the musical numbers were the products of a homicidal ingenue singer/dancer. Musicals don\&#39;t work when they take their own musical-nature too seriously (like in &#34;Moulin Rouge&#34;) or are simply too much fluff about nothing (i.e. something pointless like &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;). Upon viewing &#34;Oliver!&#34; for the first time as an adult, I saw it in a new light. Told mostly from the point of view young Oliver, I saw the musical numbers as the products of his childhood imagination and his way of coping with the horrors of ghetto life around him. The best musical number was probably when Nancy got everyone in the tavern signing and dancing about the joys of getting drunk (as a cover to help poor Oliver escape the clutches of the evil Bill Sykes). It was undeniably catchy and sounded like a real pub tune that drunks might start singing around a piano. There are other great and classic tunes to be heard here, and the direction and acting from the leads to the dancing extras are all top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, for all its bleakness (although it does have a happy ending for Oliver at least, though certainly things didn\&#39;t end happily for Nancy, and unless you think a life on the streets being a pick-pocket is fun, it wasn\&#39;t a necessarily a good ending for Fagin or the Dodger, despite their peppy closing tune) I wouldn\&#39;t really classify this as a family film, though I don\&#39;t think showing it to kids over the age of seven or eight will do any harm. This is a harsh tale about an unfortunate orphan trying to survive on the streets and find some happiness. I think it would be very interesting to see a modern update on this some how, perhaps a revisionist take on it, where people on the streets of Compton break into happy songs about their horrible lives. I\&#39;d like to see a hard-edged hip-hop version of &#34;Oliver!&#34;. I always thought Dickens would translate well in those regards. As it stands, &#34;Oliver!&#34; was probably the last of the great film musicals and maybe the strangest G-rated film I\&#39;ve ever seen.&#39;,
   &#34;Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than it&#39;s predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with and catered towards Rudy Ray Moore&#39;s limitations as an actor. It&#39;s a fun movie that&#39;s more technically sound and acted. The performers don&#39;t take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in Dolemite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the film very much and I highly recommend it. Just like his first film, it&#39;s catered towards a certain audience (I highly doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career). Check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highjly recommended.&#34;,
   &#39;The cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team &#34;Networth&#34; vs . the supposed professional team &#34;Magna&#34; but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you\&#39;d be right. While the Magna team has struggled at times, the street team has simply disintegrated week after week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First some things to reiterate as far as the &#34;Apprentice 3&#34; first of it continues the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game in this series: if your a good project manager, but you lose, the team will turn on you and you will be fired, despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs. Simply absurd, that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually &#34;weeds&#34; out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best . lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone this season, weve seen a total of cursing, backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of victims so far Cast Tara Dowdell , Audrey Evans , Danny Kastner those three are the only that I feel were unfairly fired by Trump, the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict, anger and suffering. It\&#39;s just amazing as one candidate Audrey Evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes its the game, it\&#39;s &#34;The Apprentice&#34; where manipulation, backstabbing, and always popular &#34;everyone gang up on the project manager&#34; mentality rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been an entertaining ride, though, the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses, to building of new apartments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still though it\&#39;s still the &#34;Apprentice&#34; though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner.&#39;,
   &#34;This was a typical grade B movie in 1940s Hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations. Why? It has a wonderful plot and backed up by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Dame May Witty, as a female villain, of all people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary, she certainly gets more than she bargained for. The only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise. Seems that Witty and MacReady want to pass her off as their daughter-in-law and wife, respectively. MacReady killed his real wife and wants to do Foch in as well so that a body can be claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film deals with how Foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does. Why don&#39;t people believe her?&#34;,
   &#34;...may seem like an overstatement, but it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is so hard to comprehend is - why didn&#39;t they make more musical shorts like this? Wasn&#39;t the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved? I guess not. So many shorts were made for commercial reasons only, and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there. This is one exception - the only one? - where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art. Why didn&#39;t anybody ever think to shoot Lester or Charlie Parker on a live date? Crazy, man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pity there were no sequels. If you&#39;ve seen anything of similar quality please share it!&#34;,
   &#34;How to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s actually a story of Sidney Young(Simon Pegg) breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way. Simon Pegg made an OK appearance, slightly worse than his usual. Movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments, and those moments are really hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this fun and worth watching American with English cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit, relax and enjoy movie for what it is. If you&#39;re about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it.&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting. This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes. Then the film would be much, much better.&#39;,
   &#34;Rated PG-13 for violence, brief sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating:13+(should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating:14A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen Police Story a couple of times now.In my opinion Police Story is Chan&#39;s best film from the 80&#39;s.He originally made it because he didn&#39;t like the other cop film he had to star in which was The Protector.I have not seen the protector so I cant compare.The acting isn&#39;t too bad and the plot is pretty good.I don&#39;t remember the plot well because I saw this film a while back but what I do remember is this film has lots of great action,stunts and comedy just what a good Chan film needs.If you can find Police Story and you are Chan fan then buy this film! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Runtime:106min &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&#34;,
   &#34;Red Eye is a thrilling film by the creator of Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa. After attending the funeral of her grandmother, she decides to take the red eye flight. During waiting, she meets this man named Jack Rippner, (how fffrreeaakkyy is that?) and they sort of become friends. Ironically, both sit right next to each other on this plane. Then this is when the horror starts. This movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don&#39;t like thrilling/horror films, well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants. This is an excellent example of a bone shaking production. Wes Craven did well with this film. He chose the right actors, like Rachel McAdams, an intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she&#39;s doing and is cautious of everything when she&#39;s acting in a film. Cillian Murphy, the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film, and his face can really widen your eyes. Wes Craven did an excellent job and I hope that he makes more films like this one.&#34;,
   &#34;OK where do i begin?... This movie changed my life! The plot was seamless. James Cahill has out done himself. Initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i hadn&#39;t seen it on the silver screen. However this was before exploring the DVD&#39;s many features!!!! Oh my god Jakes Cahill&#39;s commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting. he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed by the other actors. The scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway, reminded me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. I am certainly with Gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved, matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school... and possibly the guy playing a retard! All in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of Europe in years! where my Oscars at dawn!!!!!!!!!!!&#34;,
   &#34;Mina Kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing, to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies. The director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible. The music and dancing is of the highest possible quality. You may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background:other girl dancing, a drunk falling down stairs, much activity, but he knew that we would be watching Mina dance and I&#39;ll bet unless you viewed this many times, you didn&#39;t notice.All in all, perfection.J.Q.&#34;,
   &#34;This is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the scenes are very funny. I don&#39;t think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the dresses are really beautiful, pity the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in color. The way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it as soon as you can, and tell your friends about it.&#34;,
   &#39;Granted I had seen some &#34;Speed Racer&#34;, but I never really watched it and I had also seen other shows some featuring these characters dressed as birds who flew a ship called the Phoenix and another revolving around a space ship that looked like a giant ocean vessel and it flew backwards at times for some reason and was really dark and hard to understand for someone who was maybe five. This one though I watched nearly every episode and the amazing to me at the time was that this show had some resolution to it. It actually ended, the bad guys done in unlike nearly every American cartoon where nothing really concludes such as the last episode of the generation one Transformers that ended with Galvatron and this new bad guy vowing to get the Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids never making it home, with GI Joe with Cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so forth. This one did end and did feature a rather cool robot that got new weapons as the show progressed, it was a bit bland to begin with as it could not fly and had only a few really cool weapons. As it went on he got a cool shooting fist like the one Android 16 used against Cell in Dragonball Z, then that weapon evolved to include razors that shot out. Then the big robot even got wings so he could fly and even more weapons were incorporated into the wings. He would also get a couple of allies in a female robot and a rather funny one called Bobo in America. The villains not only consisted of Dr. Hell, but a really weird person that was half man half woman and a dude with a flying head. Interesting show and it was kind of nice seeing a conclusion.&#39;,
   &#39;People don\&#39;t seem to be giving Lensman enough credit where its due. A few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the Lensman experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Year: For the year it was made in (1984) Lensman features some of the most stunning effects I\&#39;ve ever seen. As a person who watches a lot of early 80\&#39;s animation Lensman is unique in it\&#39;s use of what appears to be computer-generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive. Kim\&#39;s battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this. Every time I watch that I have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks that I\&#39;ve heard, and this mad hysterical beat permeates every corner of the film. Lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one - the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine. While the music is attuned well and galvanizes scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the Thionite Factory on Radelyx, the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of Chris. It\&#39;s interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise removal when I was archiving lensman over from analog tape to digital format - since there wasn\&#39;t a single second of silence available to use as a reference point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Western Influences: Helmut - sounds like &#34;helmet&#34; and has roughly the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the princess of SW and her name sounds suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers. Takes over Han Solos role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise. Buzzkirk - a definite improvement on Chewbaka. The lens - a nice concrete copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to preach Christianity at the audience than in the original SW. While the force relied on belief far more than concentration, the lens is a pure concentration tool. Theoretically, anyone could wield the lens. The lens is far more limited than the Force - being purely a defensive/offensive weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technology: The boskone alliance have interesting meatball sponge ships. They look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white. The idea of a DNA weapon was nice if only it had been developed. The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it was called - that 60\&#39;s series where they were battling the Xylons). There weren\&#39;t enough ship to ship battles for me - this is much improved upon in the second Lensman film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally a note on Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character-design who fortunately continues on to the second film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Dick Tracy&#34; is one of our family\&#39;s favorites -- the actors are great -- the art direction is exceptional -- the music is magic. It\&#39;s not supposed to be &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; -- it\&#39;s a fun experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Sondhemim\&#39;s songs are stellar: &#34;Back in Business&#34; is energetic, &#34;Sooner or Later&#34; is just right, &#34;What Can You Lose&#34; is haunting -- even tunes like &#34;Live Alone and Like It&#34; add to the story&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got to love the giddily over-the-top performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting villains... The list is far too long. And, yes -- even Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome. Written with a smile a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said, &#34;Wait a minute -- I\&#39;m having a thought -- it\&#39;s gone!&#34;?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time -- and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer. So, if you haven\&#39;t already, why not give &#34;Dick Tracy&#34; a chance -- accept it for what it is -- a Sunday comic strip brought to life -- and in a wonderful way!!&#39;,
   &#34;At two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles. The battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between &#39;demons&#39;, bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared: following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement.&#34;,
   &#34;As the story in my family goes, my dad, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsey band. After Sinatra joined the band, my dad practiced with him for hours on end. Then, at a point in time, my dad told Sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group (band), and that he should venture off on his own. By that time Sinatra had enough credits &#39;under his belt&#39; to do just that! Dorsey never forgave my dad, and the rest, as they say, is history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some pictures and records to that effect, and so does Berkley University in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen just about every Sinatra movie more times than I wish to say, and his movies never get old . . . Thank you Frank&#34;,
   &#34;What another reviewer called lack of character development, I call understatement. The movie didn&#39;t bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory. Yes, there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of, but this was primarily a one-day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters&#39; lives. Henry Thomas&#39;s performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rental.&#34;,
   &#39;I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. What an awesome movie and incredible young man. This movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult. Denzel Washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays Antwone Fisher. Kleenex alert--Feel good and tearful. The most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother, who he was taken away from at 2 months of age. And one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister. I saw this movie on Bravo in 2008 and only wish I had known about it years ago. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection.&#39;,
   &#34;I remember that the trailer for Legend of Zu was quite impressive and being a fan of A Man Called Hero (my all time favourite), Storm Riders I decided that I must watch this one too. I know that there is way to much critcism on Ekin Cheng&#39;s acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite Hong Kong moviestar so far (way better than Nicolas Tse nevertheless)and he is one of the factors that I enjoyed this movie. Without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film. They must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that. The storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (I guess Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easily).The story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie. I wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities, but well that&#39;s life and it never goes the way you want it to. And why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end ? That&#39;s way too funny. Legend of Zu cannot be A Man Called Hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all. If a company decides to publish games on this movie I will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements. Good work. Please make more fantasy movies like this&#34;,
   &#34;I love this movie. My friend Marcus and I were browsing the local Hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film. We had no idea what it was going to be about, but it turned out spectacular. 2 thumbs up. I liked how the film was shot, and the actors were very funny. If you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think I highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie. I would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so I won&#39;t. This movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies. Do you really think Nothing is bouncy?&#34;,
   &#39;this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen. i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on TV i my eyes are glued to it. the acting and plot are amazing. it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics. i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.&#39;,
   &#39;This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists. It brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author\&#39;s subsequent opus, *Collapse*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diamond himself comes off as personable and caring, not just a disinterested or disengaged academic. This series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to &#34;publish or perish,&#34; as the saying goes about academe, but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects, &#34;Why you white people got so much cargo, and we have so little?&#34; Because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community, Diamond looked for an answer that didn\&#39;t insult that intelligence or that community. I like to think of his answer in a very simple way, in the same spirit as &#34;South Park\&#39;s&#34; &#34;Blame Canada&#34;: &#34;Blame wheat!&#34;&#39;,
   &#39;I am quite the Mitchell Leisen fan so it was a great anticipation that I rented this movie but the print I got was extremely bad, so worn down from use and scorched seemingly beyond repair, the movie was so dark. So dark that in certain scenes that are cinematographed in the dark, you can\&#39;t see a single thing. That said, I believe I share the same opinion as the first review of this movie. It starts out unusually and does not tote the lines and rhythms of your typical Hollywood 30\&#39;s movie. Heck, not even your typical Hollywod movie of any era. It seems the director has been influenced by the Europeans because there is a certain caustic realism to the proceedings from the opening shot which is so crafted in camera movement and placement as Maggie (Carole Lombard) and Skid (Fred Macmurray) meet. You half expect them to start singing &#34;Make believe&#34; from Show boat.It starts with a few laughs and poor Anthony in a one scene role where he speaks not a word of English gets slapped around by Freddie. Skids is a bum who doesn\&#39;t care that he\&#39;s a bum. That\&#39;s why he signs up in the army where he can hide from the world. He\&#39;s just been released though and in a set of screenplay shenanigans, she misses her boat for New York. This is when the movie kicks into high gear and we begin to get those French movie of the sixties vibes to the whole proceedings. The scenes are so well acted by Lombard and Cecil Cunningham, the movie gains a pulse. MacMurray is good too as he and Lombard fall for each other as she nurtures his talent for the trumpet. Then the temptress arrives in the form of Dorothy Lamour. Enough with plot. The movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me. They are very good. And Lombard scores a home run in this movie but in the second half, a bit more is called of Freddie and he fails to deliver the goods. With a heavily melodramatic ending and an actor you don\&#39;t believe, the movie falls short but since it is not your typical movie in structure, set design, and direction. It is worth a look. For what is what it was one of the 37 hits of the 1936-37 season. I don\&#39;t know its exact rank though.&#39;,
   &#39;While I do not think this was a perfect 10, I do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it\&#39;s rated here. No, Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it\&#39;s plot has been done many times before. That doesn\&#39;t mean it shouldn\&#39;t be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments. The acting of Claire Danes, as already mentioned many times, was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances(Pullman\&#39;s wife, the crooked cop, skip or trip or whatever his name is). The cinematography was also beautifully filmed, there was a lot that\&#39;s good to this movie even if there were some negatives(three major ones that I found) as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I didn\&#39;t like about it-the friendship between the girls-In fact, the girls\&#39; own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic. It would not have been improbable to lose interest before then, because, despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested, were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film. That, however, is not my major problem. And WARNING-SPOILER ALERT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending as mentioned dozens of times already, was AWFUL. It was awful in two respects. Firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood, I wanted a happy ending! Yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this, there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that. I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out or, barring that, at least the cop should have got what was coming to him. I mean nothing happens To the bad guys, they all get away with it. Very disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending. I understand endings that are inspired to make one think, but this was not a mystery or &#34;Clue&#34; type movie we were watching, and I would have liked to know something about what actually happened,who was guilty etc, with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel, I did not want to be kept guessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, there was a lot to like about this movie, and the acting is definitely at the top of the list,I would rate this a 7.5 and say it is definitely worth a look.&#39;,
   &#39;Welcome to Oakland, where the dead come out to play and even the boys in DA hood can\&#39;t stop them. This low-budget, direct-to-video production seems timed to coincide with the release of Land of the Dead, the latest installment of George A. Romero\&#39;s famed zombie series. The ghetto setting and hip-hop soundtrack may provide additional appeal for inner- city gore hounds. Ricky (Carl Washington) works at a medical research facility while raising his kid brother, Jermaine (Brandon Daniels). But the teenager, bored by macaroni-and-cheese dinners in their tract house, would rather spend his time hanging with street friends Marco and Kev. Apparently there is not a lot for African-American high-school dropouts to do on this side of the bay except deal drugs and scuffle with the homeys, including rival Latino gang bangers. Ricky plans to sell their late parents\&#39; house and move inland to the Castro Valley, a more middle-class and presumably safer environment. Unfortunately, before this can happen, a drive-by shooting leaves Jermaine dead on the porch. Grief-stricken Ricky tries a last desperate ploy. He tells Scotty, his lab assistant, to steal some of the experimental cell regeneration formula they have been testing on rats. When a double dose fails to revive Jermaine, there is no choice except to call 911. But a funny thing happens on the way to the morgue. The boy is reanimated as a sputtering, growling zombie, chews the ambulance drivers and staggers off into the night, bent on revenge and hungry for fresh meat. The feeding frenzy infects more victims, and before the night is over the East Bay is a battleground between the living and the blood-spattered undead. The horror genre has seen more than its share of cheap movie makers, from Ed Wood to Herschel Gordon Lewis to Charles Band. But low budgets do not necessarily mean bad films. Consider Val Lewton\&#39;s programmers (Cat People, The Leopard Man, Isle of the Dead), Roger Corman\&#39;s Poe quickies, Romero\&#39;s Night of the Living Dead and John Carpenter\&#39;s Halloween. The difference between memorable and awful has more to do with talent and ambition than money. Hood Of The Living Dead is more fun than several hundred million dollars\&#39; worth of recent high-priced horrors. Cheapness has its charms. In truly cheap films actors wear their own clothes amid real settings. Here the tract houses have freshly painted walls in neutral matte tones, lending a bleakness as oppressive as Douglas Sirk\&#39;s bourgeois melodramas of the \&#39;50s. Lines seem more improvised than scripted. &#34;So what the hell are we gonna do now?&#34; &#34;Just keep your eyes open for any F N\&#39; thing that looks out of the ordinary.&#34; Ricky and Scotty call their boss, who calls an ex-military man named Romero. &#34;I have a huge bitch of a problem that we have to take care of fast.&#34; &#34;Not a problem,&#34; says the merc, closing his phone and grabbing his guns. Everybody has guns, and even when fighting zombies they\&#39;re on their cell phones, as who isn\&#39;t nowadays? Information is exchanged with naturalistic understatement. &#34;What happened?&#34; &#34;We got into it with some crazy motherfockers.&#34; &#34;Deja F N\&#39; vu. It\&#39;s that park zombie again. ...&#34; Ricky even has to blow his twitching girlfriend away, saying only, &#34;She\&#39;s gotten out of hand.&#34; Unlike most zombie movies, this one provides a motive for mayhem. Jermaine takes revenge on the gang bangers who shot him, who in turn continue the rumble. This is urban film-making that implies its own social commentary, a near-guerrilla production suggesting a future for low-budget horror that reflects real life instead of supernatural clichés. The brothers Quiroz, who have trademarked their name as if in anticipation of a new movement, may inspire others to tell stories arising from personal experience rather than imitating tired Hollywood product. Considering their limited resources, Jose and Eduardo Quiroz have made a cheap but technically acceptable feature about people they know. Photographer Rocky Robinson gets the job done, music by Eduardo Quiroz is no simpler than Carpenter\&#39;s haunting Halloween theme, and hip-hop songs by The Darkroom Familia and others add atmosphere. The result is promising if not exactly exhilarating. They are learning their craft and, unlike Lewis and Wood, who never got any better, their next may be one to watch.&#39;,
   &#39;At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie. I referred to it as the most important movie I\&#39;d seen in ten years, and found myself bumping into people who said similar things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook. And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had, into a corrosive, adult world-view. The two together provide a startling mix which may be too edgy for some viewers. (Hi Skip. I wish you weren\&#39;t my brother so I could **** you!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernhards search for herself after returning to LA from New York, results in the immersive trying-on of various personas (all of which fit poorly) for our amusement, but enough of them involve acting out to appeal to a &#34;black imperative&#34; values system that the real barometer of her resituation is whether black culture accepts her. (It\&#39;s been a while. Nina Simone comes to mind. And she has an impressive, solidly-built black lover in the movie) A pretty black girl attends the shows, and seems to be authorizing Sandra\&#39;s faux-blackness, but ultimately rejects her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Catholics deem themselves lucky to suffer for Christ, here Sandra depicts herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she craves a place; as if she cherishes her worthiness and her rejection. It\&#39;s the only value system implicated in the films world, outside of Bernhards arty confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a nation whose chief issues are racism and money, it\&#39;s refreshing to see one of the 2 topics dealt with in an atypical way.&#39;,
   &#39;Hello, I was alanrickmaniac. I\&#39;m a Still Crazy-holic. It was just another movie I watched partly on TV. Then I had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends. Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to lay my hands on the soundtrack. Then on several film posters and the film script. Right now it has become that worse that I try to push other people into addiction with my website and Still Crazy parties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could that happen? What drove me into addiction? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, it\&#39;s one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the British can produce. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, the movie is worlds apart from stuff like \&#39;\&#39;This Is Spinal Tap\&#39;\&#39;, because of the characters, that aren\&#39;t childish or ultra cool, but real. This is a story about men getting older, too. A story about men getting along with each other. Or don\&#39;t. It contains some of the best actors possible. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy who puts on one of the best performances I\&#39;ve ever seen in a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good, the soundtrack is unbelievable. Foreigner\&#39;s Mick Jones has written the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail who plays bass-man Les Wickes and Bill Nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer Ray Simms are really singing. We know that about Jimmy Nail, but if you\&#39;ve only heard Bill Nighy\&#39;s singing in &#34;Love Actually&#34;, you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, you\&#39;ll fever for every scene to come for the x-th time, especially those concert scenes. You\&#39;d die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit is doing &#34;All Over The World&#34;, singing on the top of your lungs. You long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real Strange Fruit at Wisbech\&#39;s festival stage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s hard but... I\&#39;m addicted to this film. I\&#39;m addicted to Strange Fruit. If there\&#39;s a world where this band really exists I\&#39;d like to move there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got Still Crazy... anyone?&#39;,
   &#34;It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen this movie (at least 15 years) and yet it still haunts me with a vivid image of the horrific consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the Geneva Convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A unit of Australian underwater demolitions experts are captured in an archipelago near Japan following a successful mission to set mines in a Japanese harbor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other POWs but to their dismay soon learn from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies since they were out of uniform when captured. The consequences of such an infraction, by Japanese martial code, is execution by beheading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite their pleas, and the pleas of the sympathetic prison guard, the day of reckoning approaches like a ticking time bomb. The tension is so high you will actually hear the ticking, though it may just be your chest pounding with the percussion of a marching execution squad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is actually too painful to reenact in my head much less write it here. But I can promise you-- you&#39;ll never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the U.S.&#34;,
   &#34;So your bairns are away on a sleep-over ? The wife is visiting the mother in law? You though are at home.

   &#39;THE DEVIL\&#39;S PLAYTHING is my second attempt at a Joseph Sarno production - and although I will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS, it is still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle, that want to resurrect their previously murdered &#34;leader&#34;. In order to do so, the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff - and of course drink some blood, too. When a doctor and her brother\&#39;s car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging - they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires...but they may not be as helpless as they seem...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DEVIL\&#39;S PLAYTHING is a pretty good example of early 70\&#39;s exploit sleaze. Lots of nudity - including some full-frontal, some sleazy undertones - including incest and of course, lesbo-bloodsucking...but these scenes are still pretty tame by today\&#39;s standards. Some pretty hot women in this one, would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but I guess ya can\&#39;t have it all. Also would have benefited from some heavier violence/gore, being that it IS a vampire film, but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL\&#39;S PLAYTHING was more to showcase skin, not blood. Still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that\&#39;s to be expected from something from this era and of this budget. Worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking. 7/10&#39;,
   &#39;My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her. She\&#39;s from China and only heard so much about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary. I felt awful watching this documentary, it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I\&#39;m extremely grateful that I watched this documentary, because on the day of September 11th, I\&#39;m sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard, all of us could only think certain questions: &#34;Why?&#34;, &#34;How?&#34;, &#34;What\&#39;s going on?&#34;, &#34;Oh, my God!&#34;. Almost all the Americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others. But I don\&#39;t think we thought about what they were really going though. This wasn\&#39;t actually supposed to be a documentary about 9/11, the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the World Trade Centers and got everything, outside and in, on tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sep. 11th, I thought to myself &#34;It\&#39;s OK, the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived&#34;. To be honest, I thought it was an accident, I was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class. Someone came into the locker room shouting &#34;Some building just got bombed in New York!&#34;, we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on TV. Not only 15 seconds later live on TV does the second plane crash into the other World Trade Center and we knew this was no accident. A few minutes later, we heard about the Pentagon and that there was a plane headed for Chicago but was shot down. So many thoughts ran through our heads and I kept on thinking &#34;What are the firemen and policemen going to do?&#34;. But it\&#39;s procedure to them I thought, they\&#39;ll know what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first tower collapsed, we knew it, so many lives are now gone, the second tower crashed, things would never be the same. Those firemen in this documentary showed courage, confusion, and strength, the real raw human emotions. They didn\&#39;t know what to do, they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers. They heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows. And here I was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on TV. I was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all the Americans were for their help. I know they feel like they were just doing their job, but they did more, they were hero\&#39;s. Every day after Sep. 11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors, but they kept on hoping and praying. May God bless their kind and brave hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks. She got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day. She asked &#34;Why?&#34;. I didn\&#39;t know what to say, it breaks my heart that people can be that evil. &#34;It sounds clique\&#39;, but it was a normal day for everyone&#34; one of the firemen said in the documentary. No one expected this to happen. Not like that, those people in the World Trade Centers or the Pentagon or the planes that were hijacked, they were just doing their job, happen to be there, or even just was there for a second passing by. They were not just murdered, they were slaughtered, and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart. Then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating, why do people do this? They celebrated death and the lose of: mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Why? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, thanks to those people for making this documentary. You truly think about the firemen, policemen, and the troops in Iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world. Thank you to all those people, you are our heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#39;,
   &#34;C&#39;mon people, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie on Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. It&#39;s a great, cheesy monster flick with hilariously bad acting and two wonderfully moronic hillbillies that add to the schlock factor. The 2 redneck boat rental guys are the movie! LOL, and you&#39;ll love the boat scene where the English guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and it&#39;s midday and sunny. Bloody hilarious!!! You can tell they just didn&#39;t care about plot, they just wanted to blow through the filming of the movie as fast as possible. Bottom line, you&#39;ll love it if you love 70&#39;s schlock.&#34;,
   &#39;All Dogs Go to Heaven is, in my opinion, the best animated film ever made. I\&#39;m not really a big fan of animated films, but there\&#39;s something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film I\&#39;ve seen. The music is wonderful as is the performances of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page as the King Gator. &#34;Let\&#39;s Make Music Together&#34; is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any movie musical I\&#39;ve seen. This is definitely a must see for people of all ages.&#39;,
   &#34;This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe. Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation, while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York. He manages, however, to leave behind some clues, scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo enters the case, suspects her at once, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordon&#39;s secretary and would-be blackmailer. Hartley is, I believe, the grand daughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner. I&#39;m not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button, which is on display during a belly dance sequence, but I&#39;ve always admired Skinner anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The murder is well handled. It&#39;s a good plot, and none of the performers or crew fluff anything. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, only a skosh over five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and looked it. There are moments when she almost teeters, but she consistently exudes charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when she&#39;s being serious or when she&#39;s putting Columbo and the audience on. She&#39;s given some good lines too. What humor there is comes from Gordon. Columbo doesn&#39;t have any of his frequent comic moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a nice job by everyone concerned.&#34;,
   &#34;This second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen. Then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them. We know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to speak of the car. And that is what happens. Now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film. That he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how is he going to get out of it? That&#39;s what you must discover by yourself. And don&#39;t worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story. A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he is going to be wounded. They did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days. It&#39;s true recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a film? This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance? When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them, to do them. It is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines&#34;,
   &#39;When watching A Bug\&#39;s Life for the first time in a long while, I couldn\&#39;t help but see the comparisons with last year\&#39;s Happy Feet. As far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar\&#39;s sophomore effort. Sure it doesn\&#39;t manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story, nor is the animation out of this world. However, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, I could watch this one just as much as the studio\&#39;s other classics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot about finding strength from within to conquer all odds here. Between our lead Flick needing to keep his self-esteem up to save his colony, the colony needing to open their eyes onto a new way of living for the future, and the circus bugs finding that they are more than just untalented sideshow freaks, everyone evolves into a better bug by the end of the story. Even the villain Hopper is fully fleshed and menacing for the right reasons. He is not doing it to be mean, but instead understands the fact that the ants outnumber him 100 to 1. He needs them to fear him in order to not have to worry about them finding out the truth. It is very much a circle of life, but not one that can\&#39;t evolve with the ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When thinking about the animation, it is actually quite good. Compared to Antz, the rival film of the time, this is much more realistic and less cartoony. The water is rendered nicely, as is the foliage. You don\&#39;t have to look much further than the ants\&#39; eyes to see how much detail went into the production. The reflections and moistness, despite the smooth exterior, shows the realism. All the bugs are finely crafted too. The flies in the city and the crazy mix of creatures recruited to save the ants are never skimped on, whether for a small role or a more expanded one. It is also in the city that we see the workmanship on the environments. While Ant Island is nice, it is just the outdoors. Bug City contains plenty of garbage doubling as buildings and clubs. It is a great showing of humor and inventiveness to see what the animators used for everything. From the ice cube trays as circus stands, the animal crackers box as circus wagon\x97complete with full nutrition guide on the side\x97and crazy compilation of boxes to create a Times Square of billboards and facades, everything is done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as much of the humor, you have to credit the acting talent for wonderful delivery and inspired role choices. No one could do a male ladybug better than Dennis Leary with his acerbic wit. I dare you to think of someone better. Our leads are great too with Dave Foley as Flick and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Princess Atta, as well as the always-fantastic Kevin Spacey as Hopper. Spacey not only steals many scenes from the movie, but also takes center stage in the bloopers during the credits. Yes, A Bug\&#39;s Life was the originator of animated outtakes from Pixar, a tradition that has continued on. With many tongue-in-cheek bug jokes laced throughout, you also have to give props to the huge supporting cast. Full of &#34;those guy actors,&#34; it is people like Richard Kind, Brad Garrett, and the late Joe Ranft as Heimlich the worm who bring the biggest laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it may be the simplest story brought to screen by Pixar, one that has been told in one form or the other numerous times over the years, but it is inspired enough and fresh enough to deliver an enjoyable experience. There are joyous moments, sad times, and even action packed scenes of suspense with birds coming in to join the fun. Complete with a couple of my favorite Pixar characters, Tuck and Roll, there isn\&#39;t too much bad that I can think of saying about it.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Pet Sematary&#34; succeeds on two major situations. First, it\&#39;s a scary Horror movie. Those that just aren\&#39;t produced in these days. Second, it\&#39;s an emotional, clever movie overall. So if you are looking for chills, scares, creepiness and visually stunning settings, great acting, dialongs, and gruesome effects; this is the movie you are looking for. A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably, the best adaptation to any of King\&#39;s novels. The events feel a little rushed compared with the novel, but that doesn\&#39;t means that this underrated movie isn\&#39;t a complete Horror/Drama accomplishment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen King\&#39;s novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time. The movie captures the same feeling mainly because there\&#39;s a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it\&#39;s members. Then, when everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, because the title &#34;Pet Sematary&#34; does not offers appiness!) a tragic event changes the movie\&#39;s atmosphere, now it turns very dark. The movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits, but after Gage is killed the movie becomes sad, gray, creepy. Dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family\&#39;s entire life, and &#34;Pet Sematary&#34; proves it dramatically. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot. Sadly enough, the legend comes true and baby Gage returns from the dead. The previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it\&#39;s something much, much worse. What will happened with the lives of our All American family? Could Pascow prevent this tragedy? What is it with the surreal nightmares? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch &#34;Pet Sematary&#34; to witness one of the most touching, emotional Horror movies of recent times. You won\&#39;t regret. The acting is very good although I didn\&#39;t dig the actor who portrayed the father. He didn\&#39;t seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation. But that\&#39;s just my opinion. Denise Crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble, tender mother. Baby Gage was amazing even on his creepy parts. *Shivers*. Overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people\&#39;s deepest fears... the loss of someone you love, the dead returning to life, and a feeling of desperation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is for sure... I don\&#39;t wanna be buried, in a pet sematary!!&#39;,
   &#39;Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie. This is a fine movie that tells about Tetsuro\&#39;s quest to avenge his mother\&#39;s death, but also grows up in the process. The journey on the train sort of represents Tetsuro\&#39;s journey from boyhood to manhood. The music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated (you can tell it\&#39;s a 70\&#39;s movie) and the animation is only slightly better than your average &#34;Star Blazers&#34; episode. But the story and the characters are so strong, it really doesn\&#39;t matter. A must-see for any animation fan!&#39;,
   &#34;It would require the beauty and eloquence of Shakespeare to do justice to this outstanding cinematic feat. Nevertheless, I&#39;ll give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as adaptations of Hamlet go this one is already at a better starting point than all other versions since it encompasses the entire play. Still this is no guarantee for a first-rate movie, or even a good one. Usually I&#39;m not much for movies that are overlong and the trend that seems to be prevalent in Hollywood today, namely that movies should be at least two hours long, preferably three, is one that hopefully won&#39;t last long. Few stories are strong enough to withstand such extensive exploration and could do with some cutting. Making a four-hour-long movie and keeping it interesting is no small undertaking, but Kenneth Branagh pulls it off with flying colours. He has managed to make a very long movie seem no more than any average movie. I was completely engrossed from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is excellent with Kenneth Branagh himself as the tormented prince giving a strong and memorable performance. He manages to convey his feelings admirably through his voice and one does not have to be an expert on Shakespearean verse to catch the myriad of emotions that are waging inside him. Kate Winslet was a positive surprise, I must say. I didn&#39;t know what to expect really. I&#39;ve always liked her well enough as an actor, but wasn&#39;t sure she could pull off playing Shakespeare. Well, she certainly eradicated all doubts with her performance. She is the best Ophelia I have seen and lent such depth to the character and was simply wonderful. Other brilliant performances are Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Richard Briers as Polonius and Nicholas Farrell as Horatio to name but a few. I liked the fact that Branagh used some internationally more famous stars to play in some of the minor roles; I especially enjoyed the sparring between Hamlet and the gravedigger played by Billy Crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setting of the play in the 19th century gives a welcome change to the usually gloomier Gothic settings. It is overall much lighter than other versions I&#39;ve seen, more colourful and lavish, but this does not distract from the tragedy of the play. It is exceptional, stylish and aesthetically pleasing, a definite delight to the eye and other senses as well. The music by Patrick Doyle is as always magical and thoroughly in tune with the movie. One can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this. I am shocked and appalled that this exquisite work of art did not win an Academy award for best picture, even more so that it wasn&#39;t even nominated. There is no way there was a better movie made that year, or any other year for that matter. This is as close to perfection as you can hope to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, a stunning work of pure genius and I cannot see how anyone could top this. My hat&#39;s off to you Mr. Branagh.&#34;,
   &#34;Love Rosario Dawson, think she&#39;s one of the finest actresses of the modern era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. It&#39;s the consistent undertone in everything in the film. The dialog is flat, the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosario&#39;s journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pitching this as a rape classic isn&#39;t appropriate, and that&#39;s probably why so many people don&#39;t enjoy the film. The standard &#39;rape&#39; audience wouldn&#39;t particularly like this film, and maybe that&#39;s the point? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it does confront it&#39;s target audience, whether they like it or not. There&#39;s a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesn&#39;t slap the audience across the face with self-righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Descent is a good film which IMHO is severely under-rated.&#34;,
   &#39;Seeing as the vote average was pretty low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was &#34;just OK&#34;, I didn\&#39;t have much expectations when renting this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But contrary to the above, I enjoyed it a lot. This is a charming movie. It didn\&#39;t need to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the lead character, I think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that, but there are some rather hilarious scenes, and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very recommended.&#39;,
   &#34;I saw this series when it world premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. I liked the idea behind the film, where two men got together and told a director from each country to direct a movie about 911. These directors never met before until the project was complete, and they saw how it looked all together. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All the pieces were very powerful, and some were controversial. If you are an American, then you may not like this as some of the pieces may be found anti-american. However, i know a few Americans who enjoyed these series. The piece that i found the best was the one from India. It was about how a muslim family, living in the States, had 2 sons, and one of them was missing. The Americans gave them the cold shoulder and automatically assumed that he was linked with the terrorist bombing. It captures the mom&#39;s despair and humiliation of these accusations so well, that it brought tears to my eyes. In the end we see that her son had died while trying to save the many victims from the crash of the towers. This was a true story, and that was what made it so real. There were a lot of emotional and powerful pieces, and the African piece was one of the best. It was humourous yet just as powerful as the others. A must see for everyone, and hopefully America will unban this, and let it play in their country.&#34;,
   &#34;Harvey Keital&#39;s best performance so far the new century. Very nicely photographed, a beautiful snap-shot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. It&#39;s really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger, much more complex world that he doesn&#39;t yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor, the direction is crisp. Over all, a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this just makes the film a little less convincing. But if you can see beyond this, you will find a heartfelt trip to another world. Recommended.&#34;,
   &#34;Go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of Andy Goldsworthy&#39;s sculptures, and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye-opening and relaxing experience. The music perfectly complements the footage, but never draws attention towards itself. Some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot, but consider this: why would you expand on this in a movie, if you can read Andy&#39;s musings at length in his books, or attend one of his excellent lectures? This medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist&#39;s works, and is used expertly in this respect.&#34;,
   &#34;Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance&#39;s mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil&#39;s new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is within this film&#39;s subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy&#39;s big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind&#39;s fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick&#39;s purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could&#39;ve been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man&#39;s mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 9/10&#34;,
   &#34;I loved this movie. I totally disagree with some (negative) critiques that I&#39;ve read over the years. This was a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy! He appeared to have a great time with his part as Chandler Jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say, if he had fun doing it \x96 and most of his audience enjoyed it! And, it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. Murphy&#39;s great comedic style. You have to keep in mind that &#39;Golden Child&#39; is a &#39;fantasy&#39; film \x96 just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the &#39;real&#39; world. During the time this film was released, I was working in a video rental store. This was one of the most popular with all our customers. Every single time, we put this one up on our monitor, ALL the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! Everyone who rented it loved it! I was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented \x96 this was one of my favorites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them. I really feel that this film is a Sleeper \x96 it may not have done too well at the box office \x96 due to very poor marketing \x96 but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (YES, I did buy this film for my own video library!). I adored the little boy who played the &#39;Golden Child&#39; \x96 J. L. Reate - but after looking at his profile in IMDb, I noticed that he never did any more films. That is sad, because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career. I also adored Victor Wong, who played the Old Man (I LOVED him in his part as &#39;Egg Shen&#39; in &#39;Big Trouble in Little China&#39; - 1986). At any rate, this was a great film. The only drawbacks that didn&#39;t seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more &#39;adult&#39; in nature \x96 such as &#39;Chandler&#39;s rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. It was funny, but it still was out of sync. OK, so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes \x96 those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood. Now that&#39;s Entertainment!&#34;,
   &#39;Only saw this show a few times, but will live in my memory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like Friends! Especially even more difficult to obtain being in England I guess..?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the Bakersfield PD themselves? Maybe it was just too clever for certain people? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, just about the one comedy I would love to see again but is almost impossible to find. I hear it is being or has been repeated on another network? But alas not over here!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Ingenious.&#39;,
   &#34;Every time I see Nicole I like her more. I love a movie like this. A woman you just won&#39;t give up on, but she keeps breaking your heart. First movie I remember seeing like this was Of Human Bondage, the Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey version. The beefs about the correctness of the Russian spoken in this film are petty, it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can&#39;t speak Russian, I&#39;m sure. Funny how people miss the point. The no-goodnik Russian guys were well cast too. Finally, I have to tip my hat to Ben Chaplin, as somebody else noted, he plays a sap with great dignity, and there was definitely some heat between him and Nicole. To think, guys get PAID for that, mind-blowing.&#34;,
   &#34;A MUST SEE! I saw WHIPPED at a press screening and it was hilarious. We&#39;re talking nonstop laughs. It makes SOMETHING ABOUT MARY seem like a meandering drama. Amanda Peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty, brains, and serious acting ability. Peter Cohen, the director, has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men&#39;s egos in the urban dating world. For all of it&#39;s comedy, Whipped succeeds with it&#39;s intelligence. Which is so rare for a first time director, especially with a romantic comedy. He is a major talent. Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams, and Zorie Barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady&#39;s men. You&#39;ve got to see these guys go to work and get caught in Peet&#39;s web. Check out the trailer on whipped.com, it&#39;s worth the 3 minute download.&#34;,
   &#34;These two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that got a good TV series, so let&#39;s compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freddy - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freddy - 2 extra films (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy Vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra films (Robocop: Prime Directives: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach &amp; Burn, Resurrection)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freddy - 1 upcoming film Robocop - 1 upcoming film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who&#39;s had more screen time? Well they&#39;ve both had 7 movies, 1 TV series, and 1 upcoming film. But Freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one being a fan film) &amp; 17-18 TV episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddy&#39;s Nightmares - ANOES: The Series &amp; Robocop: The Series I would personally choose Robocop...&#34;,
   &#39;One thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day. The story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. The story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on. Eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey it takes you on is interesting enough, if not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.&#39;,
   &#39;Wow! I have seen so many bad low budget films lately, but this one is great. The very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police. This film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time. A perfect tradeoff!&#39;,
   &#39;Another good Stooge short!Christine McIntyre is so lovely and evil and the same time in this one!She is such a great actress!The Stooges are very good and especially Shemp and Larry!This to is a good one to watch around Autumn time!&#39;,
   &#34;The idea ia a very short film with a lot of information. Interesting, entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more. The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that I have seen. I have rated this film at the highest possible rating. I also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment. What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice is never heard. It is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward. I hope that the produced will produce a second part to this &#39;idea&#39;. I look forward to viewing the sequence. Once again congrats to Halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.&#34;,
   &#39;most of the bad reviews on this website blame &#34;Hood of the Living Dead&#34; for one (or more) of the following reasons: 1) it is a low-budget movie with virtually no acting; 2) it was so bad it made me laugh 3) it is something I could do myself. I won\&#39;t even discuss the first point because it is a very subjective matter whether you like low-budget and independent stuff or not. I must say, however, that I still fail to understand people renting such a movie as &#34;Hood of the Living Dead&#34; and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as a romantic comedy with Lindsay Lohan or Matthew Mc Conaughey. As for the second point, I really don\&#39;t see what\&#39;s so wrong with laughing. I personally like to laugh, and love movies that make me to, be they comedies or horror flicks. When in &#34;Hammerhead&#34; I saw this girl stepping into a PUDDLE and the shark-man came out of it to eat her, I just cracked up. And I was grateful that the director made such a stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun. Honestly, laughing just makes me feel good, while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as a bad bad thing. If you only want to feel sad and scared while watching a movie, &#34;Hood of the Living Dead&#34; and low-budget flicks are definitely not for you. But please don\&#39;t come and tell us that you find them laughable. We already know it. This is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place. However, it is the third point that leaves totally baffled. Just several years ago people were lining up out of theaters to see &#34;Blair Witch Project&#34;, which is a way more rudimentary, boring, plot-less and bad-acted movie than &#34;Hood of the Living Dead&#34; (and takes itself way too seriously too). Moreover, half a million people go on YouTube every day to see the short films of &#34;Lonelygirl15&#34;, which is certainly something everyone with a cute girlfriend, a room and a webcam could do! Not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there. Why don\&#39;t people blame those clips for bad acting and non-existing plot? I think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone, with affordable technology and a bunch of friends, can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests. And I feel a certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making a honestly bad (yet refreshing) piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone. Leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like a smart film critic by attacking b-movies, and you\&#39;ll see that &#34;Hood of the Living Dead&#34; can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers! If you have a taste for refreshing and enjoyable home-made horror movies, I recommend &#34;Zombiez&#34;, &#34;The Ghosts of Edendale&#34;, &#34;The Killer Eye&#34;, &#34;Monster Man&#34;, &#34;Don\&#39;t Look in the Basement&#34;, &#34;The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made&#34;, &#34;Redneck Zombies&#34;, &#34;Jesus Christ Vampyre-Slayer&#34; and &#34;Habit&#34;.&#39;,
   &#34;CONTAINS SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor sat taller in the saddle in Westerns than James Stewart, and this movie proves it. This superb tale of revenge centered around a Winchester rifle,has only one weak spot I can think of: the casting of Will Geer as a very unEarp-like Wyatt Earp. The casting of the villains was good:Stephen McNally, as surly Dutch Henry,Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntire(versatile at playing both good guys and bad guys) as a slick gun runner. The showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! I&#39;d stack this Western against the whole crop of Westerns made today. They wouldn&#39;t stand a chance!&#34;,
   &#39;I was having just about the worst day of my life. Then I stumbled on this cute film, watched it, and now I\&#39;m ready to go out &amp; kiss a streetlamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I only watched it for 2 reasons: VERA-ELLEN\&#39;S LEGS. But it\&#39;s really so much more. The plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven. It\&#39;s almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings. And of course there\&#39;s also... VERA-ELLEN\&#39;S LEGS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version I purchased (the &#34;100 Family Classics&#34; collection by Mill Creek Entertainment) doesn\&#39;t have the best video quality, and I\&#39;ve heard the same about the Alpha release. The brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your TV set to compensate. I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in \&#39;51. The stage sets, costumes &amp; colours are otherwise dazzling &amp; delightfully creepy--sort of in a &#34;Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&#34; vein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the romance goes, this is just perfect. Not sappy, not contrived, not melodramatic. Just 100% ahhhhhh. Too bad, you poor schmucks, your miserable lives will never be as charming as this. Har har har. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life sucks just as bad as yours. Oh hell. Time to watch this movie again.&#39;,
   &#39;The 1967 In Cold Blood was perhaps more like &#34;the real thing&#34; (Think about it: would we really want to see the real thing?), but it was black and white in a color world, and a lot of people didn\&#39;t even know what it was, and there was an opportunity to remake it for television. Plus, if you remake it, you can show some stuff not shown in the original. The book In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was the first &#34;nonfiction novel&#34;. Truman\&#39;s book was in fact not 100% true to the real story. I thought the Canadian location sufficed for Kansas pretty much for a TV movie. Look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock \&#39;n\&#39; roll: Dick\&#39;s womanizing, Perry being an aspirin junkie, Perry playing blues guitar.&#39;,
   &#39;This is a hard-boiled Warner Brothers film starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck. A consummate master at portraying Machiavellian cool, a technique she perfected eleven years later in Billy Wilder\&#39;s &#34;Double Indemnity&#34;, Stanwyck plays Lily Powers, the well-worn daughter of a violent speakeasy owner in a suffocating steel-town. She has been rendered cynical and numb by years of being offered up as a sexual favor to her father\&#39;s customers. Once her father dies in a distillery explosion, she hops a freight train to New York and literally sleeps her way up the corporate ladder of a bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would come across as preposterous were it not for Stanwyck\&#39;s blazing work here. With her dead-eyed stare and amoral seduction methods, it is easy to see why men become addicted to her aggressive carnality. One of the young men she seduces along the way is a fresh-faced John Wayne as of all things, an accountant named Jimmy McCoy. The melodrama gets heavy-handed toward the last third of the film with a murder-suicide, a hush-hush job in Paris to keep Lily quiet and the new bank president who is so addicted to Lily that he embezzles company funds to keep her in luxury. A tacked-on ending is somewhat disappointing but not before Stanwyck sears the screen. The film has curious touches like Lily\&#39;s bonding friendship with an African-American woman named Chico and the German immigrant who teaches Lily about Nietzsche philosophy regarding the importance of avoiding sentimentality.&#39;,
   &#39;Okay. As you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films. This is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious. The main character is a business man who is stuck in a &#34;same thing, different day&#34; mentality. He sees a woman looking melancholy out a window of a dance studio from his train everyday and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to join the dance class only to find out she is not the instructor. From there he bonds with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing as well as finding out about the mysterious woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no gratuitous (or any) sex involved, just how a small group of people learn how friendships are formed and developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was remade with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one while appealing is nowhere as enjoyable as the original. The movie never made it big in America because it was not eligible for the Oscars since it was broadcast on television in Japan (movies cannot be released on TV or they are disqualified for Oscar nominations). It did win numerous awards in Japan for best film, cast, director etc for their &#34;Oscar&#34; awards.&#39;,
   &#39;I was very impressed with this film. I would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns. I say that for the whole thing: the acting, mature dialog, no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Anthony Mann, who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one. It has that same film-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart film &#34;Bend Of The River.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, the story is about a man, &#34;Lin McAdam,&#34; (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest. It is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain. All of those villains are interesting characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiding Stewart act out this interesting tale are Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. It was a bit of a stretch, however, to see Rock Hudson playing an Indian (&#34;Young Bull&#34;), but you can\&#39;t have everything.&#39;,
   &#39;When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. Its greatness held my attention to such an extent that I focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration. I would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime, but to anyone who likes great movies period (or who likes really weird stuff). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism within it is breathtaking. I\&#39;ve heard complaints about the weird insertion of English text in the movie, but I think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie. The self-attributed description of &#34;Hello Kitty on acid&#34; doesn\&#39;t do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions. I\&#39;d like to find more works by whoever made this, and see them.&#39;,
   &#34;Clara Bow (Hula Calhoun) is daughter of plantation owner Albert Gran (Bill Calhoun), who is mainly interested in playing cards and boozing with friends. She&#39;s interested in riding in the countryside until engineer Clive Brook (Anthony Haldane) shows up to build a dam. One of her father&#39;s friends Arlette Marchal (Mrs. Bane) then competes for his attentions. His wife Maude Truax (Margaret Haldane) shows up for the contrived finale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of &#39;pre-code&#39; elements like nude bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful location shooting in Hawaii.&#34;,
   &#34;I personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating&#39;s some people have given it. It is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated, now if you don&#39;t like comic books or animation then of course you won&#39;t like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me. Though, if you are a fan of Interesting, strong characters and heroic(sexy) women kicking butt and saving the world(hell) you will love this movie. I thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie. Quite anime-esque or more like some of the American movies following this new trend of adult animation. Like Titan A.E. meet&#39;s the live action version of Punisher. In the end I highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie.&#34;,
   ...],
  &#39;neg&#39;: [&#34;I believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies. When I want a sermon, I&#39;ll go to church, but I don&#39;t want one from a movie. I don&#39;t mind some supernatural themes, (after all, religion is about as supernatural as you can get!) but this movie had so much preaching in it that I was really annoyed. The landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies. The bad guy even looked like he had horns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a silly ending: the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men, and that broke the spell. If only life were that simple. I think that when movies are that stupid, they ought to be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PREACHING CONTAINED HEREIN!&#34;,
   &#34;There are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning, and that ignorant fools like me don&#39;t &#39;get&#39; it. Obviously this means that we should stick to Hollywood dross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has every, a-hem, artistic cliché in the book - I guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few. Almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director of the (almost equally embarrassing) movie &#39;Ratcatcher&#39; returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense; it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation. The best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers.&#34;,
   &#39;A terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one. It needed some dependence on something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This totally miserable film deals with the interactions among Irish people. Were they trying to imitate the wonderful film &#34;Crash?&#34; If so, this film crashed entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is just too choppy to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. This causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing. The older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes awry but there doesn\&#39;t seem to be any punishment for the crooks. Perhaps, the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film.&#39;,
   &#34;Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It&#39;s about 8½ minutes too long.&#34;,
   &#39;I have a feeling that Dr. Dolittle was intended for an audience composed entirely of children. I think I would have had a better time if I sat at home and watched a sit-com. My favorite characters in the movie were the pet hamster and the two alley mice.&#39;,
   &#39;I won\&#39;t describe the story, as that has been done elsewhere. We are great Clive Owen fans, and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wonder we had never heard of this &#34;movie&#34;, because it was a BBC Television movie back in 1992. Hence, the poor production values, grainy image , jerky camera work and poor sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you don\&#39;t really mind the mechanics, because the story itself will put you to sleep. It\&#39;s an interesting human story, but not at all compelling, and there is hardly any ending. You don\&#39;t really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie. Save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile.&#39;,
   &#34;This sequel is a total rehash of the first film. A completely pointless movie. It basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time. It even ends the same way as the first one! The music is too busy and interfering, and because its pretty much a copy of Omen I, it&#39;s extremely predictable. It&#39;s not a horrible movie, it&#39;s not terribly made, there is much worse movies out there, this just had absolutely no point in being made. The Omen remake from 2006 is much worse, even more pointless than this, so I guess it has that. If you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, I guess I&#39;d choose this.&#34;,
   &#39;Firstly, I won\&#39;t tell you WHY I rented this movie, as I\&#39;m still confused myself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Air Rage is much like any movie I\&#39;ve seen where a plane is hijacked. There is of course that one important person on the plane, and the hijacker looking for revenge. The sad thing is, some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies. Are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it\&#39;s Ice-T (who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at ACTING while he\&#39;s not busy putting the &#34;c&#34; back in front of rap) who is glorified on the cover, the movie actually stars the less than amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is \&#39;surprisingly\&#39; OVERLOOKED by the five hijackers, which naturally comes back to haunt them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, more commonly known as Kenny Bania from &#34;Seinfeld&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie, when a hijacker used about a POUND of PLASTIQUE to blow a lock off a door... BRILLIANT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot was unnaturally predictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script - atrocious. It got to the point where I could say something, which I felt would make a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for special effects... the only thing special about this movie is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the title - the movie DID take place in the Air. But due to the less than stellar performances, the only Rage in the movie was that of the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you\&#39;re in the mood to even pick apart a movie, just because it\&#39;s bad. Please SAVE YOURSELF, don\&#39;t choose this.&#39;,
   &#34;Dolph Lundgren stars as a templar who comes to New York when a key that unlocks the anti-Christ is found by an archaeologist, of course the demon is only a couple miles behind Dolph and isn&#39;t killed so easily as he transfers from body to body. (Like Fallen without the suspense) Of course Lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable. I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his movies whenever they&#39;re on TV. I caught The Minion and boy was I ever disappointed. This movie is utterly terrible. With action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena. Worst of all is Lundgren&#39;s woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest (!) all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of Fallen (Which was good) and End Of Days (Which was bad but better than this) overall this movie is the worst movie I&#39;ve seen from Dolph Lundgren. It literally has nothing to recommend it. It&#39;s awful and it&#39;s the lowest point in Lundgren&#39;s career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters Of The Universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2* Out Of 4-(Awful)&#34;,
   &#34;Just a dumb old movie. First Stanwyck&#39;s son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way, and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck gets unlucky, yet again, and comes across an escaped convict. She has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way. In the end her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is. All&#39;s well than ends dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could never figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in Hollywood&#39;s glamour-oriented Golden Era; that nose is so beautiful\x85 So photogenic\x85 The film is mercifully short, running a little over an hour. It&#39;s as though the director sensed that he was making crap, so he thought it best to keep the crap short.&#34;,
   &#34;I cant understand at all why so many Godzilla fans think this is excellent, one of the best Godzilla films ever in fact. This film is horrible and one of the very few Gojira films I cant stand to watch again (the other being G. vs Megalon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is too campy to be in the Heisei series, a series that attempted to turn the aging Godzilla franchise into bonafide action films, revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in 1974 than 1991. It just sounded ridiculous, especially with some of the subject matter, take for example the WW2 scene, with the Japanese soldiers praising a dying Godzillasaurus, a mournful and serious tone, take the exuberant former commander turn capitalist and his death, serious seens in a film its fans somehow denote as played for laughs, as a goofy romp with guilty illogical fun, if so than this is easily one of the most tasteless films I&#39;ve seen, however I think its more likely it was only talent the filmmakers lacked and this was a case of a straight faced action movie gone bad. It was made ever worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond compare, from the jet packs to the android, to the hokey sound effects emitted from everything, its impossible to take anything seriously, and yet the film expects you to, there&#39;s no nudges to the camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like nearly all Godzilla films there&#39;s a pointless romance, and this is no exception, though something can be said about the fact that this one is especially pointless since and inexplicable. There is literally no reason at all presented for the romance, it just happens and there lives make 360 degree commitments for it. Aside from this the other terrible aspect of this film is dialogue, both the Japanese and English is horrible, clunky and possibly the inspiration for Battlefield Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tristar DVD compounds the problems, making everything look grainy, blurred, dim and just plain ugly, the same was for the sound. I first saw the Japanese Region 2 version and the differences are night and day, with the original vibrant colors and texture, the noteworthy score, the fight scenes especially, are actually watchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version) there is little to praise here, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is case in point of this failure. It doesn&#39;t even come close to deserving the reputation and fans it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 out of 10&#34;,
   &#39;As gently as I can, I sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time. I did not find it the \&#39;warm, emotionally satisfying\&#39; film others did. I found it boring, with music that distracted from the film. The story was thin, the characters overdrawn, and the direction pedestrian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fooey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I\&#39;m going to write some more about this movie, so I make the 10 line minimum. There really isn\&#39;t more to be said and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minimums, so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Young eager kid finds nascent talent, seeks time with aging, embittered mentor in spite of father\&#39;s cartoonish homophobia. Aging, embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little. conflict arises. While I don\&#39;t think this is a spoiler, I\&#39;ve added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly, I just found the film boring and pretentious. A waste of my time. I honestly don\&#39;t understand what little fuss there seems to be, mostly on this web site, about the transcendent quality of this movie. I think it\&#39;s really worth avoiding. But, as Dennis Miller used to say, &#34;Maybe I\&#39;m wrong.&#34;&#39;,
   &#39;Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable? I think not. Basically the movie is cliché after cliché and really nothing ever comes as a surprise. It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension. So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it\&#39;s a failure. This is because the movie its story is highly unlikely. I mean, no way this could ever happen in real life, as in the same way as the events occur in this movie. So the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it truly are the clichés that killed the movie. It was cringing stuff at times. Everything is so formulaic in this movie. The predator is portrayed as a cool heartless, almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman, who acts like she didn\&#39;t see any of this coming. Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason. Such as the sequence in which the \&#39;predator\&#39; fixes the \&#39;victims\&#39; broken car. That has got to be one of the oldest clichés out of the book. I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point. I tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them. It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point. The movie is filled with moments like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for TV movie. Which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary sub-plots to make the movie even more drama like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ll admit that Elizabeth Berkley is pretty good acting in this movie. She makes some of the clichés and events look even almost realistic at times. Her Hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie &#34;Showgirls&#34;, so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies- and television series like this one. It\&#39;s a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better. All of the other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays the cliché pretty \&#39;untouchable\&#39; rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse. He looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before he goes to sleep, he wants sex. He gets home, he wants sex. It might be a realistic thing but I don\&#39;t know, it just didn\&#39;t feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cliché filled movie and I can\&#39;t think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. It\&#39;s predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility. Not an \&#39;horrible\&#39; movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and cliché elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#39;,
   &#39;There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let\&#39;s get that part out of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film. Cat was... well, just awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits to over the top, outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why, why, why Mike Myers?? The kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic isn\&#39;t going to spy this film. So, what was the studio thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cat was also apparently related to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why a New York Accent? Not entirely consistent with anything Dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to sneak in his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said &#34;as long as you don\&#39;t say fahklempt\&#39;, you can keep the accents.&#34; Meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, either with the costume, make-up, or dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jokes, what few there were, were crude and age inappropriate. When Myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera: &#34;dirty ho&#34;, everything but the rim shot was missing, and even that wouldn\&#39;t have helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same folks who created \&#39;Whoville\&#39;, clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in \&#39;Cat\&#39;. The sets and props were very appealing, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing, direction, and Myers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some fun to be had with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a Dr. Seuss classic, and stayed true to the genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call the SPCA. This Cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again. Please, please, no sequel.&#39;,
   &#39;I wasn\&#39;t expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it\&#39;s amazing they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights at all. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. It changes the very nature of certain characters- Isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body- they\&#39;ve stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore. Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. The dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. In place of depth or actual emotions, we know they mean something when they scream it in someone\&#39;s face. I\&#39;ve read criticism of the early 90\&#39;s version, &#34;Emily Bronte\&#39;s Wuthering Heights&#34; which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, Gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper. Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really bad music.&#39;,
   &#39;With the rising popularity of the now iconic Godzilla series, like with any hit cinema event, there was inevitably going to be a crowd of imitators trying to cash in on the success on the big lizard. With Godzilla came the dawn of a rising popularity of the kaiju (giant monster) genre. Many sought after success; a few gained it. One of the few that not only profited, but garnered popularity was Gamera, a giant turtle that could breathe fire in and out and fly by spewing flames from the sockets in his carapace as a means of jet propulsion. But unlike Godzilla, Gamera was marketed as a friend to all children, later fighting other monsters to save kids in peril, and thus Gamera became very popular amongst the kiddies. Unfortunately, that\&#39;s about the only audience mainstream that the original Gamera series will have any appeal to. While the new Gamera movies directed by Shusuke Kaneko are marvelous, revolutionary monster movies, the original series, including the original, is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Gamera movie, titled in Japan as &#34;The Giant Monster Gamera&#34; was clearly a Godzilla want-to-be. Even though the movie was produced in the era of color films, it was shot in black-and-white. Why? To imitate the first Godzilla movie from the 1950s. Gamera also attacks Tokyo. Because Godzilla attacked Tokyo in the first movie. I don\&#39;t know much about the Japanese version, for the version I am familiar with the Americanized version, where scenes were cut and new footage with American actors were inserted (is it coincidence that the same thing happened with the first Godzilla film?) Now whether this adds or takes away from the film, I cannot say. But &#34;Gammera the Invincible&#34; is really nothing more than a ponderous bore that just plods along like the big turtle himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Gammera the Invincible&#34; is a very routine-orientated movie. The characters are from a stock of science-fiction standards, the story is inane, the monster has no real motive for attacking civilization, the acting is laughable, and so on and so forth. The only thing that differentiates it from the Godzilla series is the ending of the movie, but that\&#39;s also a detractor since the plan that eventually halts Gamera\&#39;s rampage is completely phony and ridiculous. Now the rest of the movie and many other entries in this genre also fit that description, but this is a direfully stodgy monster movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although Shusuke Kaneko would later transform Gamera into an interesting monster with his trilogy in the 1990s, in the original series, Gamera was not an attractive screen presence. He was neither scary nor sympathetic. He just waddles around like a toddler, swaying with each step, and knocks miniature sets over. As usual, everybody wants to destroy Gamera except for a little kid (Yoshio Uchida who was lazily left out of the credits though he plays a \&#39;central\&#39; role) who thinks Gamera is a nice turtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most movies in the genre that &#34;Gammera the Invincible&#34; is a part of are easy targets for criticism and this one is subject to extra pressure. Even in the company of many other Godzilla-imitators, this Gamera film is not a particularly good entry. And as far as my cinema experience goes, the rest of the movies in the series are either just as boring or worse. Like Godzilla, Gamera would be filmed in color and go on to fight monsters. And like Godzilla, he\&#39;d get cheaper and cheaper with every film until it was time to revive the series and make him serious again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s peculiar. Usually I recommend people to stick with the originals and pass on the remakes. But in the case of Gamera, my verdict is just the opposite. I strongly encourage people to watch the 1990s Gamera trilogy directed by Shusuke Kaneko and to skip over the original series unless interested. The new films are inventive, well-made, exciting, and above all, fun. The original series is a long stream of boredom.&#39;,
   &#39;I can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like &#34;we want to make sure they are playing for the right team&#34; and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it\&#39;s true face. The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it\&#39;s obvious intent, so far from attempting art. This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library.&#39;,
   &#39;The plot is plausible but banal, i.e., beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk, then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her. But, what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical. Despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic, their attorney and local police (who say they can do nothing) at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror. They have no private security staff (only a fancy security system that they mishandle), household or grounds staff, chauffeurs, etc. Not even, apparently, the funds to hire private round-the-clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life-threatening injuries, leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner. The production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). And, shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering.&#39;,
   &#34;Some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films amongst others, the bulk of their output is crap like The Zombie Chronicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it&#39;s nowhere near as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Other than that, its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s been noted elsewhere, but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence, so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks, you&#39;ve seen it all already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit), and kudos to Hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like I was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awful, awful stuff. We&#39;ve all made stuff like this when we&#39;ve gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere. Avoid.&#34;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t like this film, but then I didn\&#39;t think much of the book either which, although lauded by many as a &#34;masterpiece&#34;, I found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot, although it was far more readable than Fante\&#39;s dreadful first effort &#34;Road to Los Angeles&#34; not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid 80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued to see what sort of soup Towne would make with such meager ingredients. He has worked hard script-wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didn\&#39;t rescue it. There was never a movie in Ask the Dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book. I consider this film Towne\&#39;s folly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word: forgettable.&#39;,
   &#34;Fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart Orcas are but in the meanwhile (and quite oblivious to them) makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film. Richard Harris plays Quint.. I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a living, but is lured by the big catch, and tries to catch a killer whale. When the capture of a female killer whale goes awry (don&#39;t ask) it&#39;s mate (don&#39;t ask) goes on a rampage (don&#39;t ask) and starts STALKING Captain Nolan (Don&#39;t ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (don&#39;t ask). Pretty amazing film-making here folks. I got to tell you though, the beginning (with the whale noises and nothing much else) is pretty haunting and the end credits (with the most godawful song) is pretty entertaining.&#34;,
   &#34;I don&#39;t know if the problem I had with this movie is that I was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but I believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film. If you don&#39;t have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk.&#34;,
   &#34;This was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-make of Conan Doyle&#39;s famous novel &#39;The Lost World&#39;. And it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts promisingly enough, with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and Challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. Everybody is stranded on the plateau and we&#39;re left with a feeble, boring, over-length rehash of the first film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dinosaurs (who are hardly ever seen) are just laughable. Are we expected to take that cuddly toy that&#39;s supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the Lost World. Unbelievably in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re-make.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie is an utter waste of time, the plot is awful, the dialogue is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is OK, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. The photography and some of the special effects are OK, too, but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical progression to the story, the story line is utter nonsense. It isn&#39;t even scary. For a movie to be scary, there has to be at least a small element of believability. This movie has no believability at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is shallow and has no personality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done, or at most mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie.&#34;,
   &#34;The animation was good, the imagery was good, although not totally original, however, the story was too long, way too confusing, and over the top dramatic. After about an hour I couldn&#39;t wait to get it over with. With so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn&#39;t one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies. If you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it, but frankly, I&#39;ve been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell. Go rent a Miyazaki film and watch it twice, you&#39;ll get way more out of it.&#34;,
   &#34;I didn&#39;t know it was possible to release a movie this bad. The labeling sounded so promising, but you would think that with a cast of 20, at least one of them would be able to act. My wife left me and went to bed after the first 20 minutes. She made a wise decision.&#34;,
   &#34;This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian TV stations to fulfil local content quotas. The writing was truly terrible and I&#39;m not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst Australian film in recent memory the Honerable Wally Norman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing about this TV series was funny - ever - not even mildly amusing. It was just tired and BAD and, worst of all, it really thought it was funny. It was simply embarrassing to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something very suss about this show being given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review by a (real) Australian viewer of the show (there weren&#39;t many) and it is impossible. Or crazy. There are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on DVD, remember that the laughter THAT deserves was unintentional.&#34;,
   &#39;Okay, I\&#39;ve watched this movie twice now, I have researched it heavily on the net, I have asked several people on there opinions. I have even gone to the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic \&#39;Carmilla\&#39;, a book that this movie is supposed to be based on. I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it. As the plot of the movie doesn\&#39;t seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her Father, Mr De Lafontaine. They carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day they get a letter from the \&#39;General\&#39; a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death. He makes claims of supernatural powers being at work, and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to come down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And just what has she to do with Laura\&#39;s condition, and the General?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name, and would have a jingle too, but I can\&#39;t be bothered with that. It\&#39;s called the &#34;this movie doesn\&#39;t make any sense&#34; game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you have to do is, whilst watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening. I mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will have to answer such questions as ... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why can vampires walk around in day light?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why are they all lesbians?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why is a girl called Bob? and why does she shoot herself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When is the movie a dream and when is it real?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn\&#39;t make anyone bat an eyelid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why does Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car, yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* And why does he then let a girl, which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire, drive with him in his car?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* And then let her drive off, alone with his daughter in a stolen car?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the hell is the asylum scene all about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* What the hell is the green goo all about?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* What is the significance of the necklace? what is it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how does Jenna know that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact sod it, it\&#39;s just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my plot, and I have to admit it is not quite there, but it is a pretty good effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\&#39;Vampires vs Zombies\&#39; has no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?&#39;,
   &#39;Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito\&#39;s Way - &#34;Carlito\&#39;s Way: Rise to Power (2005)&#34; which went straight to DVD...no wonder .....it completely ...and I mean completely S%&amp;KS !!! waist of time watching it and I think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it.... I don\&#39;t understand how De Palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... too bad for him I don\&#39;t think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this sh#$%ty movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.&#39;,
   &#34;Some here have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made. Well, they are only partly right. For me, this IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE PERIOD! I have never seen anything so basely crude, and insulting, and vile, and against human nature as this film. A true embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry, this isn&#39;t even so Bad, its good. There is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of Elvis&#39; other bad movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten to sit through its painful. Pure Garbage. Native Americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here. Actually, perhaps ALL Human Beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 Stars, seriously. Grade: F&#34;,
   &#34;Camera work - Why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy? This is annoying and distracting. Editing - the Flashes of the still pictures were way too short. Many of the other scenes were too short also. Just flashes. Sound - the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices. One should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said. Doesn&#39;t anybody check these things and make them do it over again. Please reduce the volume of the background music in future. Is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor, Julia Wong? The plot had way too many loose ends. The basic story line had potential. I think the film needed more work. Was it rushed? Perhaps they ran out of money. Like a lot of movies, it started out great but just petered out toward the end. I really don&#39;t understand this, you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn&#39;t all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to be so critical.&#34;,
   &#39;OK, I knew this would be a back alley F-film (well below B-film standards) going into it, so I thought, &#34;Man, I could use a good laugh, so let\&#39;s see some nether-beings kill each other.&#34; Well, what I got could have been found at your local &#34;love toy&#34; store. Random lesbian scenes, very little fighting, and no plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, one scene in particular I remember (for its sheer stupidity only; I\&#39;ve seen better porn on ABC) is where the two main characters (I can\&#39;t remember their names offhand...great movie, huh?) are driving along, as they mostly did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driver: &#34;Let\&#39;s pull over, I\&#39;m tired. You want to take over?&#34; Passenger: &#34;Sure, I can drive for a while.&#34; (Once pulled over, the driver starts grabbing the passenger\&#39;s boobs) Passenger: &#34;What are you doing? I\&#39;m not like that!&#34; Driver: &#34;It\&#39;s OK, everyone does it sometime.&#34; Passenger: &#34;OK then.&#34; (Proceed to take off shirts, fondle, kiss, and perform fellatio)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, last time I checked, horror films were not in the porn section of Hollywood Video (unless you\&#39;re into S&amp;M, then you go elsewhere), and it definitely shouldn\&#39;t be in the mainstream videos at Blockbuster. Don\&#39;t get me wrong; I\&#39;m definitely not one of those people who hate porn, but I only watch it when appropriate and definitely don\&#39;t want to watch it if I\&#39;m looking for a movie in the mainstream stores, as this one I rented was at one of the two retailers I named (and probably at the other too if I went and looked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony. If I could give it a 0, I would, but I can only give it a * of 10.&#39;,
   &#39;The husband-and-wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville, yet they made very few films. As is the case for some other performers of their era (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them, in which they\&#39;re portrayed by other actors: \&#39;Somebody Loves Me\&#39;, starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable song-and-dance man Ralph Meeker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their heyday, Fields and Seeley were so hugely popular that another husband-and-wife vaudeville act -- Jesse Block and Eve Sully -- achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act, effectively becoming the &#34;second-team&#34; Fields and Seeley. Offstage, though, there was a major difference in the couples\&#39; living arrangements. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying room-service rates for every meal they ate, and eventually running out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely, ending in comfortable retirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two spats-wearing pianists. Apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930, although I\&#39;ve never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely rush in and start performing. They both have plenty of pep, and she\&#39;s fairly attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they\&#39;re about to break into a dance, but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short. When they finally start hoofing, the results are not impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act. Now that I\&#39;ve seen it, I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals. My rating for this one: just 4 out of 10, and I\&#39;ll stick with Block and Sully.&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;ve had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one. THIS IS IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake this film is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s a list of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopeless storyline (despite being based on a true story). Dreadful acting (what was Judge Reinhold thinking) Unbelieveably bad stunts. Childish dialogue. Non-existent continuity. Lack of atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the picture?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#34;I remember this movie when i was 13 (seems a lot of reviews are saying the same thing AGE 13!) with a group of school buddies. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie, and fell for the typical commercial ads telling us this was a great comedy. We suffered through about 45 minutes of it, and all agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque &amp; tasteless, and a far cry from the ability Billy Crystal had to make us laugh, we were not laughing. I stumbled upon this review by accident, and decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a rot-gut waste of film this was, now if you rent this, you deserve what you get, YOU&#39;VE BEEN WARNED!!&#34;,
   &#39;This film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The details of the film shown on IMDb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but I did not see this at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying &#34;suggested by the book Silas Marner&#34;. Suggested? It was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. One night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside. The man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. It is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. The battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. In only one can I find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of Mr Martin too far. On top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story. Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. This is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made. If I was a trustee of George Eliot\&#39;s I would insist on reparation. If I was Steve Martin I would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor. At the very least it should be entitled Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin. Or better still removed from the archives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980\&#39;s.&#39;,
   &#39;I am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5.2/10 For what affects me, it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I still keep wondering why I watched it until the end. First of all, the plot is totally hopeless, and the acting truly awful. I think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than Susan Lucci; concerning Mr. Kamar Del\&#39;s Reyes, I think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his &#34;Valley of the Dolls&#34;. To sum up, it is total waste of time(and i\&#39;m trying to stay polite...) to avoid at any cost. My rating is 1 and I still think it is well paid, but since we cannot give a O....&#39;,
   &#39;i love bad shark movies. i really do. i laugh hysterically at them. and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them, culminating in the premier of their new original picture, hammerhead: shark frenzy. based on the previews, it looked like it was going to be HIGHLY amusing. essentially a remake of benchley\&#39;s creature, really. it was prefaced by a showing of shark attack 3: megalodon, which is shark movie hilarity at its best. i was in the mood; i was ready to go. bring it on, hammerhead-mad-scientist-man! oh, god, was that movie wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wrong, wrong, wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sick. twisted. MESSED UP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is theoretical reproduction at its very worst, my friends. when a drugged-out girl is brought out of suspended animation and strapped to a table screaming her head off because the shark-human hybrid fetus the absolutely insane &#34;scientist&#34; deliberately implanted in her womb wants OUT... Jesus monkeys. that\&#39;s what i call disturbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that\&#39;s really how the plot works: hmmm, thought the mad scientist. my son died of cancer, but i brought him back to life by combining his dna with that of a hammerhead shark, because sharks don\&#39;t succumb to cancer and further hammerheads reproduce via placenta. oh, look! a perfect amphibious being! i\&#39;ve created the next evolution of the human race! I KNOW! let\&#39;s make him reproduce! but darned if all those shark genes have\&#39;t made my son bloodthirsty; instead of raping the hot babes i keep sending into his little jungle paradise, he keeps eating him. but check this out! among the random people who have, by way of some unimportant plot twist, ended up on my research island, is the woman to whom my son was engaged before he died! i bet he\&#39;ll do HER! all this leads up to an extremely touching and heartfelt reunion: woman: you\&#39;re going to impregnate me? mad scientist: no. he is. (indicates thrashing shark-person in tank) how sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. ever.&#39;,
   &#39;Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and I went to see the full-feature movie-version of &#34;Earth&#34; by DisneyNature. I guess, like the auto manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really do care about the planet, I don\&#39;t know, but I don\&#39;t think it warrants a special unit with the word &#34;nature&#34; in it. I do know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to tell a one-year old my personal feelings about Disney? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Preceded by a half-dozen Disney movie trailers, rife with Disney cliché (&#34;circle of life&#34;, &#34;falling with style&#34;), over-dramatic music, recycled footage (Disney claims &#34;40% new footage&#34;). I was even starting to think that James Earl Jones narration is getting a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman doing every Warner Brothers narrative starts to wear thin. I really think that Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was so spectacularly done, they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound-bites on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what is Disney\&#39;s obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals? There were a half-dozen such scenes, complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out. I think Disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action-movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents. I was also cognizant of how Disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change. Are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it\&#39;s still a controversial subject? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend skipping this one and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Nature films seem to be best done by the British at the moment.&#39;,
   &#39;Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish of a film. For starters, the script was definitely written to be made into a B-film, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television) and Hutton (looking for the &#34;two&#34; of a &#34;one-two punch&#34; he had hoped would define his career after &#34;Ordinary People&#34;) became attached to the picture. Cheesy lines, big bad wipes from scene to scene (Come on--who uses wipes after 12th Grade Telecommunications class?), and plain old bad acting sink this film. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I must admit feeling Duchovny\&#39;s pain as he read the lines that are the voice-over. While I found myself laughing when I\&#39;m sure the director wanted me to feel terrified, nothing prepared me for the closing line of Duchonvey\&#39;s voice-over: &#34;if you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911.&#34; If only the studio had called 911, this dog of a motion picture would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;This movie was like &#34;The Disney Channel after Dark.&#34; Take out the &#34;aren\&#39;t we naughty&#34; language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn\&#39;t describe &#34;Saved by the Bell&#34; as quality television. The dialogue so laughably cliched and knowingly dirty, one might think the screenplay was the product of locking Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating. If that was Roger Kumble\&#39;s intention, mission accomplished.&#39;,
   &#39;I am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S@#t I have ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror, but I got bored and turned it off.Let\&#39;s see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wardrobe: Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. The masks were made from what looks like tin foil. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I must give it that. But Ittenbach\&#39;s Burning moon was better for a low budget movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting: Was horrible! I didn\&#39;t mind the dubbing. I find this humorous like in Ittenbach\&#39;s &#34;Premutos&#34; (great movie). The fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Don\&#39;t watch any of Schnaas\&#39;s movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter. Check Premutos, House of blood, Schramm and the nekromantiks.&#39;,
   &#39;Hollywood, the home of hype, glamor and the search for profits, is scarcely ruled by spiritual values, and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly (better to go farther afield--to the films of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, for probing depictions of the spirituality). &#34;Strange Cargo&#34; is no exception. This odd hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate. That a figure of providence and salvation would work to match Verne (Clark Gable at his most cockily mannered and self-regarding) and Julie (Joan Crawford, snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the Queen of Tough Dames) seems ludicrous at best. Is this the Patron Saint of the Star System at work, matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the M-G-M lot? BUT. . .there are good supporting performances here, and visually arresting moments: the shadowy prison barracks; the escaping boat by moonlight, or against a painterly cloudscape; Julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) bargaining for Verne\&#39;s freedom as the storm builds; an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts. . .Above all, there is Paul Lukas\&#39;s dignified and detached performance as Hessler, a murderer who can appreciate Cambreau\&#39;s virtues, yet turns his back on him. In the film\&#39;s most arresting moment, Hessler, having left Cambreau, stands outside the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, see the shadows on his face, which conveys a moment of fear and self-doubt. Then he exits into the night. In this moment, Hessler achieves an ambiguity, depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve. is the film\&#39;s secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with Hessler?&#39;,
   &#34;After the success of Part 4, another sequel was a natural move. However they should have stopped it before it began. Alice, having survived Part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems Freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims, which of course are Alice&#39;s friends. Strange Nightmare movie, very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the movie itself is not.&#34;,
   &#39;I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films, so that was not my problem with it. My problem with it is that I felt like I was watching my next door neighbor\&#39;s home movie. IMO everything about it just seemed like a guy wrote out a quick story, grabbed a camera, and started shooting. I understand how hard this must be to do effectively, but when I pay to rent a film, I expect to feel like I am watching some type of professionally made movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Schneider has a huge resume, is a great actor, and was fine in this film. The other people in it were not. I understand how it must be fun, and cheaper to use friends, and relatives as the cast, but it doesn\&#39;t make for convincing acting. It seemed like the way it was shot, he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when the writing, plot, and acting are there to begin with, that type of style isn\&#39;t necessary, and it is a distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on a technical level, it had digital artifacts all over the place. In the first scene of all of those fine cars, when they did a slow scan of them, they appeared to jerk back and forth just a little bit. The problem isn\&#39;t in my viewing equipment, (Benq PE-8700 84&#34; diagonal) but somewhere in the production. I\&#39;ve never seen that kind of artifact in a professionally made film before. Then there was the sound. It sounded like they didn\&#39;t do any voice-overs, which may be o.k. unless it sounded like the track in this film. It sounded like the built in microphone on the camera.&#39;,
   &#39;In the 60\&#39;s, having as the background the rehearsal and recording of &#34;Sympathy for the Devil&#34; in the classic album &#34;Beggar\&#39;s Banquet&#34; by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones \x96 Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones \x96 plus Marianne Faithful, Godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements \x96 the Black Power through the Black Panthers, the feminism, the communism, the fascism - entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapters: &#34;The Stones Rolling; &#34;Outside Black Novel&#34;; &#34;Sight and Sound&#34;; &#34;All About Eve&#34;; &#34;The Heart of Occident&#34;; &#34;Inside Black Syntax&#34;; and, &#34;Under the Stones the Beach&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Sympathy for the Devil&#34; is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director Jean-Luc Godard. The narrative and the footages are awful, but fortunately I love the Stones and &#34;Sympathy for the Devil&#34; and it is nice to see them in the beginning of their careers; otherwise this documentary would be unbearable. My vote is three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Sympathy for the Devil&#34;&#39;,
   &#39;i\&#39;m being generous giving this movie 2 stars. the line about &#34;have you even seen the wizard of oz&#34; was the best part for me! with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie it\&#39;s no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows. do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game, your gonna be glad ya did!&#39;,
   &#39;Painfully bad Christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by Vince Vaughn, who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children\&#39;s movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his R rated films. Vaughn seems like he\&#39;s on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance. After 30 minutes into the film, you would be in touch your inner scourge and say &#34;Bahumbag&#34; at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes, you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point. Out of all the actors involved in this mess, only Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that\&#39;s manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film. Paul Giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of Saint Nick himself but he\&#39;s forced to Vaughn\&#39;s level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting. You can see in Giamatti face that he\&#39;s not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film. Rachel Weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she\&#39;s well aware of that, so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film. Fortunately for her, she\&#39;s not in the film much at all and is able to save some face, unlike Giamatti, who looks like he\&#39;s about to fire his agent by the end of the movie. The direction also feels uninspiring, like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved (Giamatti and Weisz) trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with, spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand ( and this is a Christmas movie of all things) and a actor who just does not care about his performance (Vaughn), you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch.&#39;,
   &#39;Wow! I remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s. They usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students. As I watched this film I felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s. However, then I find out that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools. Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise $200,000. So the seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you raise $200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in? And why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out? And...ahh forget it, this film was stupid and made in 1989!?&#39;,
   &#34;First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she&#39;s just awful. This movie has every horror move cliché in imagination, and all badly played. The over-sexed teen couple. The comical(not)horny jock. The snotty cool chick. The creepy local color guy. The parental-type couple. The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re wishing that they&#39;d all die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago, but somehow, this just got worse. Sure, the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson&#39;s implants, but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs.&#34;,
   &#39;The Minion is about... well, a minion. A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped. He is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another. Anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret order of Templars, who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion. The movie begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion. Then flash forward to 1999, where the key winds up somewhere underground in New York. An archeologist is assigned to study/dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion is after the key, and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and Lukas and archeologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie, is just that, a low budget B-movie flick. The movie lacks energy, and just trods along. You\&#39;ll follow the chase but you won\&#39;t ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies (especially The Terminator films). The fight scenes with the minion is troublesome, in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is. It &#34;skillfully&#34; becomes a one-man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one-on one. And it\&#39;s supposed to be around for a long time. All this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience. The whole idea of a secret order of Templars, a door to hell, and the key isn\&#39;t well explained. We are merely to accept that they just exist. The movie seems to have been made with the feeling there\&#39;s not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict: 2 of 5 stars.&#39;,
   &#39;TOM BROWN\&#39;S SCHOOLDAYS &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspect ratio: 1.78:1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound format: Stereo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late 19th century England, young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the public school at Rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster (Stephen Fry) and stands up to the school\&#39;s resident bully, Flashman (Joseph Beattie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations - most notably Gordon Parry\&#39;s superior 1951 version - Thomas Hughes\&#39; evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment, courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV\&#39;s &#34;Where the Heart Is&#34;) and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It\&#39;s pleasant enough, and watchable, but it\&#39;s also rather staid and dull, distinguished only by Fry\&#39;s sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school\&#39;s most dubious \&#39;traditions\&#39;, and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old Pettyfer, a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is typical UK TV fodder, the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with \&#39;prestige\&#39; product, even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this. The UK publication \&#39;Radio Times\&#39; described it as &#34;daintily odd&#34; and raised a querulous eyebrow over &#34;all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome, rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys&#34;. Quite.&#39;,
   &#34;wow i payed £3.50 to go see this movie at the cinema. Cant believe i wasted my time. The acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude. Probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life. I swear to god &#39;swept away&#39; is better than this. Madonna should of won and Oscar compared to these guys. An hour and a half of my life i want back. Honestly people don&#39;t see this, even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence. i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden, theses guys here of the actual puppets. pleas guys don&#39;t waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it.&#34;,
   &#34;I was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film. I didn&#39;t enjoy the first one at all, and the last Jean Claude Van Damme film I liked was Blood Sports! After managing to sit through it all? Avoid, avoid, avoid!!&#34;,
   &#34;I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue doesn&#39;t explain the story very well, and I was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes. There isn&#39;t one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting. I just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath&#39;s love seems very incestuous. They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers. I don&#39;t understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films, but like I said, it&#39;s extremely hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl&#39;s performance was horrid which was a complete shocker. She was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of Edward, and there just wasn&#39;t enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but came off as whiny and overdramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just didn&#39;t enjoy this movie very much or the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not. I just pictured something so completely different.&#34;,
   &#34;If you haven&#39;t seen the gong show TV series then you won&#39;t like this movie much at all, not that knowing the series makes this a great movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#39;s a funny snapshot of the era it was made in, the late 1970&#39;s and early 1980&#39;s. 2) You get a lot of funny cameos of people you&#39;ve seen on the show. 3) It&#39;s interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he isn&#39;t doing his on air TV personality. 4) You get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the TV show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#39;t list all the bad things because there&#39;s a lot of them, but here&#39;s a few of the most prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Gong Show Movie has a lot of the actual TV show clips which gets tired at movie length. 2) The movie&#39;s story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point. 3) Chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970&#39;s flatness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a good movie to watch when you don&#39;t have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it&#39;s not so bad. But even then it&#39;s not so good either. ;)&#34;,
   &#39;Despite some moments in heavy rain, an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanitarium, this Roscoe &#34;Fatty&#34; Arbuckle silent comedy short with support from Buster Keaton and Al St. John is only fitfully amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of Arbuckle in drag flirting with Buster that\&#39;s the ultimate in &#34;meet cute&#34; scenes especially since it\&#39;s one of the few times we see The Great Stone Face smile and laugh in the movies! Also, many scenes seem to have been jump cut edited possibly because of overuse of the film stock. Still, if you\&#39;re an Arbuckle or Keaton completist, Good Night, Nurse! is certainly worth a look.&#39;,
   &#34;I think that Elisabeth Rohm, though she may try hard, is not very good at all. I guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price. I mainly watched it for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch. When he wasn&#39;t on the screen, the thing went dead. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the creeps, but be assured that in real life he is a kind, funny compassionate man. He even said playing that role gave him the creeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll watch anything with him in it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as exciting as lint on Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.&#34;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m sorry to say that there isn\&#39;t really any way, in my opinion, that an Enzo would really be able to keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The power to weight advantage possessed by the S7 would just be too great. The S7 has a power:weight ratio of 3.93 lbs/hp while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs/hp. The S7s low end is much better too. Sorry Ferrari fans but the Saleen just gets it done so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for other parts of this film, I just have to say it\&#39;s so substandard as to be pathetic. The story is way too weak. The acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem. This film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about. Its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t give the film a &#34;1 Star&#34; rating because it didn\&#39;t compel me to actually walk out of the theater. I also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal....although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of \&#39;Variety\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skid row version of James Vanderbeek.&#39;,
   &#39;I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie, as I didn\&#39;t think it was going to be well done. The kids, ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it, so I caved. I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought, but was still a far cry from the book. The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old\&#39;s understanding and sense of humor. I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place. I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don\&#39;t show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the &#34;silly&#34; or &#34;stupid&#34; choices.&#39;,
   &#39;Where to begin? How best to describe just how awful this movie is???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s start with the campy hick humor. It isn\&#39;t very funny. Add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Pity poor Art Carney, who should have known better than to do this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there is the plot. A roadie whose life goal is to work an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, just when the movie should end, they can\&#39;t come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well, I won\&#39;t ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a &#34;B&#34; movie or perhaps worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. That\&#39;s a sure sign that the movie probably won\&#39;t be very good. If nothing else, the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s just say this. This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. And none are worse than Roadie.&#39;,
   &#34;Boring, predictable, by-the-numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of (mindless) mayhem and gore to satisfy (mindless) genre fans. Mostly it&#39;s about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we don&#39;t care an iota about - if that&#39;s your thing, tune in. (*1/2)&#34;,
   &#39;Terrible!!! I don\&#39;t want to be too negative but this film has an IQ of stupid monkey.What a disaster.I just couldn\&#39;t believe how bad this movie is.The dialogs are just very strange and off topic,the camera work at times just horrible,the music at times like a soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia,I just watched this film to see how much worse it can get.Some of the side kick &#34;actors&#34; are total disaster.Sorry but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film. . . . . this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film&#39;,
   &#39;I absolutely despise this movie. No wonder Jose Larraz &#34;disowned&#34; it at one point and refuses to discuss it. I admire Larraz\&#39;s work, especially his more obscure slasher/sex maniac thrillers like SAVAGE LUST or SCREAM AND DIE. His work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he can\&#39;t seem to switch off, owing in part to his secondary career as a painter &amp; cartoonist. It\&#39;s too bad he never made a Western, his vision would have been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLACK CANDLES is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece VAMPYRES. And it\&#39;s notoriety revolves around one scene where a Satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat -- symbolizing The Beast -- as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of Satan. The scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with, relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the film\&#39;s recycled musical score heard in a half-dozen films attributed to Jacinto Molina. The perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail, heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen-aged daughter of the Satanic priest. My but they had fun concocting this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with it is that there isn\&#39;t much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin ROSEMARY\&#39;S BABY derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as Satan\&#39;s bride by a sophisticated coven of Satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister Britain. Led by Eurohorror sensation Helga Line these Satanists are comprised of doctors, lawyers, land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil. All you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours, only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film attempts to combine this heady Satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex, and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror Spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by Mr. Molina &amp; Ms. Line, and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one Generalissimo Franco, the dictator who controlled Spain up until 1976. While he lived his decree was that Spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on-screen sex. Spanish directors often made two versions of their films, one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export. As difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden: Spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste. It\&#39;s not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in a bizarre turn of events, without Franco\&#39;s influence on their culture Spanish horror sort of dried up in the late 1970s, when their Gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves passé when compared to new sensations like JAWS and the STAR WARS phenomenon. And without Franco\&#39;s constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late 70s/early 80s, of which BLACK CANDLES is perhaps the best known due to it\&#39;s emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal. Larraz\&#39; major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos (the lesbianism of VAMPYRES, the incest of SCREAM AND DIE &amp; DEVIATION) but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production. Nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the Goat Barn, and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness. The sex isn\&#39;t graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills aren\&#39;t chilling enough to rate as horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, BLACK CANDLES is essentially a behavior study -- Here is how high society British Satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the West Midlands or whatever. Between sex scenes the actors/actresses sit around and have lots of discussions. The best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia, with most of it\&#39;s action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of Ms. Line\&#39;s character\&#39;s mansion. Nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of soft-core sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused, and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene. But the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly, pretentious, intelligence insulting, and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10; Without the Goat Barn this movie just isn\&#39;t the same, and with the scene it\&#39;s probably a bit too much for most viewers. Larraz was correct to disown it.&#39;,
   &#39;And I mean ultra light. This film features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really isn\&#39;t too much to say about this stinker, other than that although it has a couple of really good bits, most of it isn\&#39;t very funny. Nor does it work at all as a romance. How about as a romantic comedy? Not on your life. Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated, much less amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What\&#39;s really ashame is the premise is not bad at all. This movie could have been so much more, especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted, complete with phony quotes from critics. The film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes, it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film\&#39;s lame romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same with Catherine Zeta-Jones\&#39; character -- the whinny, self centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she\&#39;s given, but she\&#39;s given practically nothing. It\&#39;s all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we\&#39;ve heard about stars over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it is hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship, which sinks like a rerun of &#34;The Love Boat.&#34; In fact, as the old joke goes, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. It would probably make a better story. So, go ahead and tell us, filmmakers, what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this?&#39;,
   &#39;I saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called &#34;It lives by night&#34;. That title is much less misleading than &#34;Batpeople&#34;. In fact it would more accurately be called Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who studies bats I am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. This is not really clear. What is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat. Why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me. Shouldn\&#39;t he be able to go in by himself. Well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits. They go to the worst doctor ever. The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. In the end the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.&#39;,
   &#39;i was enjoying this movie most of the time, but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children\&#39;s movie. i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. it was a big let down. there\&#39;s that believe the children magic that exists in movies like &#34;babe&#34; (the pig) or &#34;angels in the outfield&#34; that defeats the evil tooth fairy. the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when i bought this movie, i thought it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness falls; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but they don\&#39;t. they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls.&#39;,
   &#39;First of all I just want to say that I LOVE this show!!! But this episode...this episode makes a mockery of the entire show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the WORST episode in the entire series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no story line, everything is chaotic and the jokes.....are crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game..... For example &#34;how do the furlings look like&#34; by creating that stupid &#34;previously on...&#34;......is simply embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad.&#39;,
   &#39;I gave this two stars for the awesome DV shot clarity, which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was being generous, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film fails on all accounts. I can not recommend this, for it is neither poetic, nor blunt. Neither dramatic, nor suspenseful. Neither controversial, nor ordinary. It is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not watch this, whoever you are. . .please, just stay away from this awful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&#39;,
   &#39;...but it\&#39;ll make you wonder if we had any in the first place! This movie is just as bad as any of today\&#39;s horrible horror. A man goes around ogling semi-clad ladies, trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minutes, coating everything what what must be well over ten gallons of &#34;blood.&#34; The movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the movie is so badly done it\&#39;s impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage. Aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister, this movie can\&#39;t even get its own title straight-- the beginning credits say &#34;The Brain That Wouldn\&#39;t Die,&#34; but the end credits list it as &#34;The Head That Wouldn\&#39;t Die.&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;We went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled. It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever. It is not that i don&#39;t like cult-movies I do. But nothing happens in the film. One does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever. endless times without dialog. And the car. How do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car? It is a two seater! I have to say however the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie, so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would not recommend it, as it is a waste of your time&#34;,
   &#39;Despite, or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters, stereotypes are in, and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not-too-subtle cinematic screed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One gets the sense that John Singleton was dabbling in post-structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day, and &#34;Higher Learning&#34; was the tendentious result. The low point of the movie is the &#34;peace&#34; rally, in which the symbols of the 1960s &#34;free love&#34; movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a &#34;Take Back The Night&#34; rally with live, stridently identity-conscious musical acts in tow. Perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new Vietnam? Ooh, how Adrienne Rich of him\x97and Remy\&#39;s firing into the crowd is a nice touch, if you\&#39;re into Rich\&#39;s sort of political posturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history, a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race, class, and gender to popular culture and declared man-hating &#34;a viable and honorable POLITICAL option&#34;. Where\&#39;s Camille Paglia when you need her?&#39;,
   &#39;Watching Floored by Love one thought comes almost immediately to mind, &#34;My god this looks like a really bad sitcom.&#34; Sure enough, it turns out that FBL is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in Canada, poor poor Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cara (Shirley Ng) and Janet (Natalie Sky) are a lesbian couple living in Vancouver. Janet has come out to her mother already but Cara\&#39;s parents are still in the dark about their daughter\&#39;s homosexuality. The pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from Malaysia for her younger brother\&#39;s wedding. That same week British Columbia legalizes gay marriage. With Janet wanting to wed, Cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative Chinese parents that\&#39;s she\&#39;s gay. Will she? Would she? Could she? Cara\&#39;s situation is contrasted with that of Jesse (Trent Millar). Jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen. His biological father Daniel (Andrew McIlroy) is coming for a visit soon. His stepfather Norman (Michael Robinson) fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by Jesse are harmed by the fact that Daniel is gay and he is not. Will dialing 1-800-Makeover help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950\&#39;s program along with the overdone physical emoting. The Full House-style melodrama is enough to make you wince from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail. McIlroy, Millar &amp; Sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with, it\&#39;s no surprise that none impress. It\&#39;s possible that the campiness was purposeful. It often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad, that they must be trying to mimic the inferior sitcoms of days yore. If this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten. The rewrite would focus on Floored by Love being a poor and ineffective send-up of old sitcoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer/director Desiree Lim has put together a by-the-numbers bland-fest that\&#39;s entirely forgettable. There was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen. That time is gone. In this day we need quality as well.&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;ll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New Yorker persona, because quite frankly, to draw comparisons with bumbling loser Josh Kornbluth, is just an insult to any such director. I will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire `Office Space&#39; in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe. I can, however, compare it to waking up during your own surgery \x96 it&#39;s painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they&#39;re doing. Haiku Tunnel is the kind of film you wish they&#39;d pulled the plug on in its early stages of production. It was cruel to let it live and as a result, audiences around the world are being made to suffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s premise \x96 if indeed it has one \x96 is not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia, is offered a permanent job. His main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss. But ludicrously, he is unable to perform this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! That&#39;s not a story\x85 it&#39;s a passing thought at best - one that should&#39;ve passed any self-respecting filmmaker by. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leading actor \x96 if you can call him that \x96 is a clumsy buffoon of a man, with chubby features, a receding, untamed hairline, and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing. Where o where did the director find this schmuck? What&#39;s that you say\x85\x85 he is the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing, but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth isn&#39;t that convincing as a human being, let alone an actor. Rest assured, this is by no means an aimless character assassination, but never before have I been so riled up by an actor&#39;s on-screen presence! My frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel, Kornbluth insults us further by `explaining&#39; the action (first rule of filmmaking: `dramatize exposition&#39;\x85 show, don&#39;t tell). Who does this guy think he is? He has no charisma, no charm, and judging by his Hawaiian shirts, no sense of style. His casting agent should be shot point blank!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt, with but one exception. Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as Helen the ex-secretary, who has been driven insane by her old boss, and makes harassing phone calls from her basement, while holding a flashlight under her face. This did make me chuckle to myself, but the moment soon passed and I was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s title is also a misnomer. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Don&#39;t be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office\x85\x85\x85 there&#39;s a very good reason for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;The film &#34;52 Pick Up&#34; simply does not work. See it if you are at all interested in Elmore Leonard or John Frankenheimer, or anyone in the terrific cast, especially John Glover who\&#39;s admittedly brilliant. But the book--a slow-burning, noir thriller with lots of pulp--should have translated into an Oscar-contending film instead of this dud that couldn\&#39;t figure out whether it should faithfully portray the hard-boiled, gritty crime story of the book, or opt for a 1980s Schwarzenegger shoot-em-up spree. Shifting the scene from the original locale in the book, Detroit (an area where Leonard has resided for years and knows very well), to Los Angeles makes for a substantial problem that Leonard tries to fix in his script, but ultimately can\&#39;t. It was, for example, a clever device making Mitchell\&#39;s wife a City Councilwoman (she had no job in the book), if you think about it: that\&#39;s the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sex-crazed city like 1980s Los Angeles for adultery, or any type of potential sex scandal. Even then, it\&#39;s more plausible in a more conservative Eastern state like Michigan to believe that a) its tiny porno &#34;industry&#34; is a sleazy, money-grubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a not-so-stupid upper-middle-class fellow going through a mid-life crisis, and b) adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with, if their upstanding careers and old-fashioned wives couldn\&#39;t handle the shock. As consultant Ron Jeremy will tell you, 1980s Los Angeles was a colorful, stylish porno Mecca, more like the movie &#34;Boogie Nights&#34; than Leonard\&#39;s dark, shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses, grimy apartments, and drug deals in depressed urban squalor. Then again, Los Angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully--there are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there. Unfortunately, Roy Scheider\&#39;s Harry Mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy, handsome Uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat. In the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing. He also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for, but never appeared to come to grips with. Elmore Leonard\&#39;s stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and law-abiding citizen. Here, Harry Mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer, Alan Raimy, turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom, makes for such a central image. Glover\&#39;s blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence, but Scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky &#34;good guy,&#34; in charge of the situation as if he were more a Rambo with an M-16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him. &#34;52 Pick Up&#34; ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever, considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film. Trapping Raimy inside Mitchell\&#39;s Jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by Mitchell, plays to an audience wanting the &#34;sweet revenge&#34; conclusion of a Chuck Norris movie, not the intelligent balanced world of Leonard\&#39;s book, where Mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way. I left the theater shaking my head and depressed. What a waste of talent.&#39;,
   &#34;This has got to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. I remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, I ran out to purchase the DVD once it was released...what a tragic mistake! I won&#39;t even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow. I am a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis so I am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level. It is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible...if that was their goal, they suceeded. If they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way, shape, or form that it is real then they failed...MISERABLY! Avoid this movie...read the plot synopsis and you&#39;ve seen it!&#34;,
   &#34;Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the &#39;How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes&#39; award. Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of silliness will ensue. However, the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny. It is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998&#39;s Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle-aged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, whose husband&#39;s legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money. Helped by her gardener, Matthew, she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads her into confrontation with the local police, her husband&#39;s creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously. The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is well-portrayed, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character - you can really feel what she is going through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casting of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace&#39;s romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all. And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing? Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants.&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing &#34;Last Days&#34; and some Charlie Chaplin films. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give &#34;Immortel&#34; a chance. I nearly walked out of this movie, and I LIKE science-fiction! The story is set in a futuristic New York city, filled with Blade Runner-style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning/synthetic humans. Unfortunately, the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour-and-forty-five-minute movie. Three groups exist in this world: humans, artificial humans, and Egyptian gods. The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city. The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and complete with a deteriorated exterior, leaving a smooth &#34;cap&#34; on the pyramid. Wouldn\&#39;t a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it\&#39;s there. I won\&#39;t bore you with the so-called plot, but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross-out scenes. The film, as I said, looks to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film credits were listed thank-yous to the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. The film is FRENCH, but uses British actors who don\&#39;t speak French. Hence, it is obvious that their French dialog has been dubbed. This is a distraction, and I also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting. It doesn\&#39;t help that the animations are poor--no better than a video game. Skip this one.&#39;,
   &#39;This is a rather tame fluff piece concerning WW II codes being broken, stolen, etc. The acting is about what I expected from this cast of MGM &#34;B&#34; actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big caution. Jean Rogers, who did such a great job playing the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two Flash Gordon serials is just awful in this movie. Her character is extremely annoying. She absolutely never lets-up with her overacting. We are supposed to believe that during the height of a World War in what would obviously be a Top Secret code facility, she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function. From that standpoint I\&#39;m sorry that I ever watched this film. It has forever changed my perception of Ms. Rogers. Talentwise, she is an extreme lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee Bowman is his usual self, meaning that he is merely adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn&#39;t like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another lousy film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackie&#34;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t know why, but i thought i\&#39;ve seen this movie before. Maybe it was the name, maybe it was the way poster looked, i don\&#39;t know. Anyway, it was quite promising in the beginning. And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments. Maybe its because i\&#39;m not a huge fan of the horrors, and i don\&#39;t watch them a lot, but this one actually looked fresh sometimes. But the rest of it is not so good. Laughable at times. The movie is slow paced, sometimes you will get so bored you\&#39;d forget what was the story about. Characters are not great either. All of them. The butcher is OK, seems creepy and crazy enough. Although i didn\&#39;t get what were those weird looking things on his chest (that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out-of-the-blue), and why he was collecting those in jars at home? The main lead is plain. His character is really hard to believe in, and very undeveloped. But i guess thats scenarists fault. Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend? Side cast is bad too. But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl. My god, when will women in horror movies have any brains? Its ridiculous. The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera, tries going to police, that fails, and then she thinks of the best idea ever. Why don\&#39;t we just go and take it! I know where the maniac lives! Yup! Thats swell! And then look for the camera in the bathroom! Why not? And then walk in the room, see a bag that was not there before, and just have a look inside. Maybe camera is there? Not there. But loads of interesting stuff. Shiny. Mmmm. To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain. Then of course the never ending &#34;falling while running away&#34; trick, that really made it look bad. Then, to put the final nail into the character, in the end of the movie, she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up, screams &#34;Noooo&#34; like she just ripped her Gucci bag, and walks further into the wagon... Jeez. Come on. No one else thinks its just, well, stupid? Just awful. If her character wasn\&#39;t so bad, maybe the movie would get another star or two from me. And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer (that dude in the train who the conductor killed), butcher vests that can protect from bullets, weird and cheap looking monsters in the end (i didn\&#39;t read Clive Barkers novel, so i have no idea where those monsters came from), the fact that no one cared that hundreds (judging on the skeletons in the dungeon) disappeared in the city, and main character that didn\&#39;t bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out (he barely noticed it i guess). Oh, and the predictable ending. Damn, i knew the ending half way in, its just disappointing. The only reason i\&#39;m still giving some credit to the makers, is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i\&#39;ve watched past few months. Visual style is nice, some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal. (although blood didn\&#39;t look real at all) I guess some people will enjoy it, some, like me, will watch it if there is nothing else to watch, some will absolutely hate it.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m a nice guy, and I like to think of myself as genre-tolerant. And, I guess by that, I mean I try to consider a movie in the context of the genre that it resides in. If nothing else, that saves me from feeling like I should be saying really nasty things about people or films, which I don\&#39;t like doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot in this one was patently obvious, the production values very low and sets, uhm, simplistic. The acting rose into &#34;good for a high school play&#34; territory from time to time. My feeling was this was filmed in a day -- please tell me it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, the sex , while reasonably plentiful, was fairly mundane, hampered by, at least in my copy, a &#34;sound-over&#34; that was inconsistent with the action (climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed undoing a bra???). There was definitely no &#34;edge&#34; to it at all--nothing distinguishing or interesting, and with surprisingly quick cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My vote is a &#34;1&#34; then, with the following summary statement: would have been better if the filler stripper material at the club was expanded, and the rest of the movie condensed.&#39;,
   &#39;You believe in God or you don\&#39;t. You believe in Jesus or you don\&#39;t. You believe He is the Son of God or you don\&#39;t. The choice is up to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring back Jesus to a mere historic figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary, Who opened Heaven again for us. Encouraging the Big Bang, a world come from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian bringing some &#34;modern findings&#34; to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play, who happily incorporates them in his play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the Passion Play is performed in Montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the Passion Play instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. More often than not the director\&#39;s abhorrence of the Church is clearly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director has tried to make a parallel between Jesus\&#39; life and the Passion Play actor\&#39;s life. This is an admirable attempt, but depicting the Resurrection with the transplantation of the Passion Play actor\&#39;s organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is not important, God\&#39;s opinion is, but I wouldn\&#39;t want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before Jesus\&#39; throne.&#39;,
   &#39;Warning: Avoid this super duper awful movie...if you watched it you will be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam and Denise are grandma age now what are they doing? Trying SO HARD to be young innocent and sexy, just not working AT ALL. Pam and Denise act so horribly in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus The script is absolutely atrocious, I can\&#39;t believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas. With the development of movie industry, movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century. I bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from it. I think watch &#34;White Chicks&#34; from 2004 it\&#39;s so much better that this...make no mistake at that time I thought that\&#39;s the worst movie I have ever seen.&#39;,
   &#34;I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The opening moments, with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter, Diana, about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art, give the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy-vampire flick. Turns out this initial impression turns out false. Oh, Troma, the mark of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they&#39;ll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk-food craft (or, sometimes not). This is a case where it&#39;s not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor (i.e. the protagonist&#39;s father is an old vaudevillian who does Jimmy Durante impressions?) are weak at best, and any unintentional laughs are undercut by Sergio Lapel&#39;s bargain basement direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#39;s not without him trying, oh Lord no. He does try a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for lights, sure, but the way they&#39;re used in the movie made I, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulking in my seat: if I saw this in a theater I would have to blind my eyes in many instances, and would wonder whether or not his DP understood really the basic 3-point lighting set-up. While this, along with a very lackluster sound design (or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene), shouldn&#39;t be something that comes to attention during a Troma release, it should be something *basic* that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn&#39;t very funny or scary (and it isn&#39;t) or if Lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not a good movie by any stretch, and perhaps if you&#39;re a vampire die-hard (or just a vampire period) it might have some appeal as a low-rent bargain basement alternative to Near Dark, or as a slight improvement over, say, 1972&#39;s Blood Freak. You have better ways to waste your time, overall.&#34;,
   &#34;I feel like I&#39;ve just watched a snuff film....a beautifully acted, taut, engrossing and horrible thing! A two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burial, and abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption whatsoever. And I WAS entertained. I couldn&#39;t stop watching. What does this say about me, about the people who make and act in this sort of thing, and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm. And I&#39;m neither puritanical nor humorless, I don&#39;t try to hide from the existence of darkness, and I definitely have not led a sheltered life, but I am ashamed of myself. AND I&#39;m sorry to see my British cousins dragging the subject-matter sewers the way my own tribe does. It doesn&#39;t have to be cozy, but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism?&#34;,
   &#39;Well, I don\&#39;t think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be. . . but there\&#39;s no denying that it\&#39;s got problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly, the problems are in the script. There\&#39;s a plot - but not much story, and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible; it trots out any number of self-consciously strange and/or stereotypical characters, lines, moments, what-have-you and, by the end, it just hasn\&#39;t added up to much in this department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I couldn\&#39;t care less about whatever &#34;social ill&#34; Farnsworth might be trying to address; there will always be a sector of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains, even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia, or whatever it is those morons do. So, as a film, you won\&#39;t find me calling &#34;Iowa&#34; &#34;important.&#34; But, at a stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting and some of Farnsworth\&#39;s choices in depicting a meth-head\&#39;s wigged-out state are beautiful, hilarious, disturbing and - yes, I\&#39;m going to say it - inspired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is uneven, but that just may be a casualty of the afore-praised stylistic reaching. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a fine actress - but she\&#39;s not very good here, so a discriminating audience member does have to ask, &#34;What happened?&#34; It\&#39;s weird that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near. For example, I might seriously consider whatever explanation Farnsworth could provide for Michael T. Weiss\&#39;s over-the-top turn as a probation officer, but I doubt I\&#39;d ever buy it; It Just Doesn\&#39;t Work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, it\&#39;s the most alive and in the moment that I\&#39;ve seen John Savage appear in years. So go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the sort of work that tantalizes, but does not promise - and that\&#39;s okay; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies. So, whether or not Farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen, but if he does, it seems pretty likely that it won\&#39;t be bland pap. In an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of &#34;American Idol,&#34; perhaps we could allow, not scorn, Farnsworth\&#39;s legitimate and undeniably flawed film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is more, perhaps we could welcome, not berate, his energetic and sometimes blessedly idiosyncratic imagination.&#39;,
   &#39;Warning Spoilers following. Superb recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, libelous!, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast. I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada. Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode was coerced to make the USAF the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.&#39;,
   &#39;Don\&#39;t let the name of this film deceive you, In reality Jake Speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film. When Jake Speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen, which he is often not, he\&#39;s seriously relaxing. Perhaps this adds to his charm, but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to &#34;chill out&#34; whenever he gets the chance. Furthermore, unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless of course you call sleeping a talent. Anyhow, this movie is basically worthless, the writing is sub par and the action, when there is some, is very lame. (The machine guns on the jeep weren\&#39;t bad, but that\&#39;s about it) So, if you\&#39;re in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - It has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep, but also his audience.&#39;,
   &#39;Vodka Lemon is a charming, yet extremely uneven Arminian film that will delight some and bore others. Though reasonably well-crafted, the film lacks any real &#34;zing&#34;, relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art-house viewer. The film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled. You may laugh, but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides. A noble effort, ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion.&#39;,
   &#39;note to George Litman, and others: the Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is &#34;I don\&#39;t think so, *breeder*&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my favorite riff is &#34;Why were you looking at his \&#39;like\&#39;?&#34;, simply for the complete absurdity. that, and &#34;Right well did not!&#34; over all, I would say we must give credit to the MST3K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie. you really can\&#39;t make much fun of the dialog; Bill S was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would disown it. a junior high school drama club could do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that you buy a book and read \&#39;Hamlet\&#39;.&#39;,
   &#34;Probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever, badly acted and badly written.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PLOT Five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm, but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one, the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or could it be one of the five characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTING Not that bad not that great either apart from Daphne Zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine, and the rest well quite dull although Laura Lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE KILLS Can&#39;t really see why they banned this, the kills look fake mostly, one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake, but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car, one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL Not really a great slasher could have been a lot better&#34;,
   &#39;It\&#39;s 1978, and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well! Fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, only less happy there are so many black players on the field! This made for TV Super Bowl movie is watchable. It\&#39;s not much more, but it\&#39;s really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance (for the time), probably most notably Tom Selleck. Unfortunately any goodness Selleck brings to the screen, is quickly trumped by &#34;actors&#34; like Dick Butkus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a silly story about super bowl betting. PJ Jackson is charged by &#34;New York&#34; (read mafia) for ensuring the game ends for their favor, in this case a $10,000,000 bet. PJ is innocent enough, and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, the unsuspected Lainie, takes charge. For a while, the mystery of murders isn\&#39;t known for certain, but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a bad movie, but is watchable. The acting is decent, and the filming is OK. At least there weren\&#39;t any silly typical 70s car chases (they have their place just not here). Just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you\&#39;ll survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10 (maybe a 2.5)&#39;,
   &#34;I have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny, but it&#39;s still fun to watch and good for a few laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80&#39;s stars that plays a good bad guy, not really evil, just unlikeable. Dolly Partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here. Jane Fonda is so-so and does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times, gotta love her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could recommend this to anyone that likes 80&#39;s comedy. I like the movie but it has things about it that I don&#39;t like. It starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters. They all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although &#39;cute&#39; I just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie. As the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down, only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 10 stars, but give it a try if you haven&#39;t seen it. I think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable.&#34;,
   &#34;Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it&#39;s pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it&#39;s just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They&#39;re all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it&#39;s over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of boring. I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So said we all.&#34;,
   &#34;This film is absolutely horrific. One of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen. The story does nearly not exist, the characters are full of stereotypes and the Special-FX only make you laugh. The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as some kind of police officer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this film was supposed to be a comedy I didn&#39;t quite get the point. If you want to watch this movie: please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs...especially when the first Special-FX appear on the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you like trash movies made on the cheap: this film is a must-see for you.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Plan B&#34; is strictly by-the-numbers fare except for one thing. I surprisingly found it to be rather insulting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon Cryer is the &#34;star&#34; of this film and plays his usual, smarmy, egotistical, snotty character that was actually endearing in &#34;Pretty In Pink&#34; and has NOT been amusing ever since. Grating doesn\&#39;t even begin to describe his performance. Ricky (Mark Matheisen) is a muscular, blonde, struggling actor who (gasp!) is only worried about his hair and getting laid. Talk about a stock character...ugh. At least the other three characters are somewhat engaging. Lisa Darr and Lance Guest play a grounded, optimistic, caring couple who are struggling to conceive. Since they are not whiny drama queens, however, their roles are apparently considered boring and they aren\&#39;t given enough screen time. Sara Mornell rounds out the cast by playing Gina, your usual nice and good-looking young woman who just can\&#39;t seem to find the right partner in love. I\&#39;ve seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes. They introduced a Russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked. He was portrayed as being wild, ignorant and amazingly shallow. They were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays. Gina decides to be gay for a while since she isn\&#39;t having any luck with guys. Honestly. That wasn\&#39;t that bad except they really went overboard when Gina brought a lesbian to a Christmas party her friends were throwing. Her lesbian date had very short hair (like I\&#39;m sure all lesbians do). She also got quite upset (like I\&#39;m sure all lesbians do) when Gina had the nerve to put on lipstick(!). Finally, her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when Gina expresses her disappointment. Of course, we all know how gay people can\&#39;t stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years, right? (Please note the sarcasm in that statement. Thank you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but Cryer\&#39;s unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema. 2/10&#39;,
   &#39;There\&#39;s been a vogue for the past few years for often-as-not ironic zombie-related films, as well as other media incarnations of the flesh- eating resurrected dead. &#34;Fido&#34; is a film that\&#39;s either an attempt to cash in on that, simply a manifestation of it, or both -- and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped, squeaky-clean, alternate-history (we are in the wake of a great Zombie War, and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves) version of a 1950s suburb. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a moderately funny concept on its own, and enough perhaps for a five-minute comedy sketch, but it can\&#39;t hold up a feature-film on its own. The joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again, and loses all effectiveness. The soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders. The word &#34;zombie&#34; is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very broadness and artificiality of the representation of &#34;the nineteen fifties&#34; here can\&#39;t help but irritate me. It is so stylized, in it evidently &#34;Pleasantville-&#34;inspired way, that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950s-ness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959. There is something obnoxiously sneering about it, as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open, down-to-Earth, and superior the 2000s are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the characters are such broad representations of pop-culture 1950s &#34;types,&#34; it\&#39;s difficult to develop much emotional investment in them. Each has a few character traits thrown at him or her -- Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father -- but they remain quite two-dimensional. Performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine. The best is Billy Connolly as Fido the zombie, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in &#34;Frankenstein&#34; actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around -- to commodity fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoia, et cetera, but none of it really works on a comprehensive level, and the filmmakers don;t really stick with anything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this film doesn\&#39;t really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of &#34;Look! Zombies in \&#39;Leave it to Beaver!\&#39;&#34; for a good hour- and-a-half.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Proximity&#34; tells of a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him. This very ordinary film is an action/drama with a weak plot; stereotypical, poorly developed characters; and a one dimensional performance by Lowe. A forgettable film not worthy of further commentary.&#39;,
   &#39;That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a muddle. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not an edgy work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is no clever. There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That is missed theatrical release is not surprise. That the &#34;This Network&#34; airs it diminishes that venue. I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.&#39;,
   &#39;This was a big disappointment for me. I think this is the worst Mastroianni-movie ever made. Cosmatos tries too hard to make this movie a masterpiece and that makes this movie a typical &#34;art&#34;-movie. I give 4/10 for this movie.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie was different in that it didn&#39;t show the typical gay stereotypes that I&#39;m used to seeing. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline. I&#39;m sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen, since Black gay characters are seldom seen, and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed. But, how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning, middle and end. Or how about a story that was focused. There really doesn&#39;t seem to be a point to this film, and even though it is a low budget film, that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme stars in this movie.There are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting in this movie is so bad and its the worst acting i have ever seen and the 2 actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White Can not act at ALL.And this movie by far has to be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes worst movies he has done and if u what to watch him in one of his great movies u should watch Blood sport,KickBoxer or Sudden Death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this movie is crap/OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.&#39;,
   &#39;This is really a very bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It is an artificial story, combining all sorts of things together that make no sense. It just seems a wrong experiment. Secondly, the actors cannot play in a realistic manner. They cannot even talk as an actor should. Why did I buy this movie? And what must I do with it now?&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;ll have to add dissenting comment here. Various reviews I have read compared this movie to the likes of those by Wong Kar Wai or Hou Hsiao-hsien. i.e. one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years. Unfortunately this isn\&#39;t quite accurate. The film plays out rather like a film school graduate\&#39;s attempt to emulate these masters. All the pieces are there - the beautiful backdrop, the vaguely minimalist dialogue, the slow swaying camerawork, and male leads, in particular, who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative. Sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par. The dialogue is leaden. The acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type; the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving. Unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical &#34;Chekovian&#34; (i.e. very predictable) plot, the results are at best tedious and at worst painful. I couldn\&#39;t help but see the &#34;Blue Danube&#34; river scene, for example, as verging on genre parody (although the smoggy looking &#34;springtime&#34; sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour...) I actually went to this movie on the basis that Mark Li Ping was photographing it. While the setting is elegant, and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of &#34;Flowers of Shanghai&#34;, the film is not in the same league, visually. In fact I must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film, I suddenly remembered that I was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave (and I can\&#39;t recall the last film I walked out of). I\&#39;m guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point I couldn\&#39;t care. If you\&#39;d like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then I\&#39;d recommend anything by the above two directors, for example &#34;In the Mood for Love&#34; or &#34;Flowers of Shanghai&#34;, both of which were filmed by the talented Mr Ping (the former with Chris Doyle), and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this. It\&#39;s not often Mr Hoberman leads me astray, and perhaps you\&#39;d rather listen to him, but don\&#39;t say you weren\&#39;t warned. Craig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;Despite being released on DVD by Blue Underground some five years ago, I have never come across this Italian &#34;sword and sorcery&#34; item on late-night Italian TV and, now that I have seen it for myself, I know exactly why. Not because of its director\&#39;s typical predilection for extreme gore (of which there is some examples to be sure) or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time (it is set in the Dark Ages after all)\x85it is, quite simply, very poor stuff indeed. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that I have yet seen and, believe me, I have seen plenty (especially in the last few years i.e. following my excursion to the 2004 Venice Film Festival)! Reading about how the film\&#39;s failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director\&#39;s subsequent (and regrettable) career nosedive into mindless low-budget gore, I can see their point: I may prefer Fulci\&#39;s earlier &#34;giallo&#34; period (1968-77) to his more popular stuff horror (1979-82) myself but, even on the latter, his commitment was arguably unquestionable. On the other hand, CONQUEST seems not to have inspired Fulci in the least \x96 seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist, sprinkle it with incongruent characters (cannibals vs. werewolves, anyone?), irrelevant gore (we are treated to a gratuitous, nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh-eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists!) and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked, brain-slurping villainess (don\&#39;t ask) and her slimy reptilian pet!! For what it is worth, we have two heroes for the price of one here: a young magic bow-carrying boy on some manhood-affirming odyssey (Andrea Occhipinti) and his rambling muscle-bound companion (Jorge Rivero i.e. Frenchy from Howard Hawks\&#39; RIO LOBO [1970]!) who, despite being called Mace (short for Maciste, perhaps?), seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger protégé out of trouble (particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the \&#39;boils\&#39;). Unfortunately, even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex-Goblin Claudio Simonetti\&#39;s electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times. Fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness (after defeating one and all with the aid of the all-important magic bow\x85so much for his own supposed physical strength!) onto his next \x96 and thankfully unfilmed \x96 adventure!&#39;,
   &#34;I got this movie in the $5 bin at walmart. I would not recommend watching this move. I might give it to one of my friends if I am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie. It&#39;s just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another. The drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, here is my rant about this movie: To me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end. It doesn&#39;t. After the movie was over I through it behind my T.V. because I was angry that I wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.&#34;,
   &#39;I rented this back in the 80\&#39;s and honestly can\&#39;t remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is THE worst movie I have ever seen. This isn\&#39;t one of those &#34;it was so bad, it was funny&#34;. This isn\&#39;t one of those &#34;it was so gory, it leaves you with a bad feeling&#34; movies. It wasn\&#39;t even one of those &#34;what the heck was that?&#34; movies. I can\&#39;t recall the performance of the actors, but it was poorly shot, the story was disjointed, and it had no definable style. When it was over, I was angry that I had wasted the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve seen plenty of movies I didn\&#39;t understand because of unfamiliar cultures, styles and/or story-telling, but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties. The incubus has none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually contemplated NOT making a comment on this &#34;piece&#34; for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity, but I am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie.&#39;,
   &#34;Cecil B. deMille&#39;s 1922 parlor-to-prison tearjerker Manslaughter finds the lovely Leatrice Joy as a good-at-heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with. Her recklessness leads to imprisonment, which in turn leads to her regeneration. Thomas Meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in Lydia (Joy) but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released, it is up to her to rescue him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the plot doesn&#39;t sound too bad, you&#39;ll be floored by the woeful presentation. The quality of deMille&#39;s direction is very low, and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him. The photography is standard and flat, and the editing is hardly more dynamic. One could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct. DeMille gets to dress Miss Joy up in so many different types of clothes (evening gowns, golfing costumes, motoring costumes, piles of furs) that it&#39;s subtitle could be &#39;Fashions of 1922&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting, which is mostly flat and wooden. When it is not, it is merely routine silent gesturing, rolling eye balls, twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements. What would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films, is here merely dull to watch. The only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is Lois Wilson, who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally. She is convincing and endearing in tearful close-ups, as long as you don&#39;t read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak. Like I said, everybody else is droningly routine, Joy, Meighan, even Julia Faye. Her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it. Meighan&#39;s character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of America is declining in it&#39;s moral stance, and going right back to the decadence of Rome. (insert absurd flashback) This movie&#39;s moralizing has been described as Victorian, but it&#39;s further than that. It has so little bearing in reality that I have a feeling audiences at that time didn&#39;t take it any more seriously than modern viewers could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a &#39;typical&#39; silent movie, with it&#39;s archaic moral structure, wooden acting and bad direction. DeMille shows that he could be a terrible director, with no sense of pacing, camera placement, or skill in handling either script or actors. I can&#39;t imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously. Boring, slow and idiotic, I recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie should be number one on the bottom 100. The acting is so horrible that when my son and I watched it we nearly got physically ill. And the story is worse. I could go on and on about how bad it is but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob&#39;s review as I see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet. Don&#39;t waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. Thank goodness we saw it on TV so we didn&#39;t spend anything on it. Had we, I would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed watching Carrie Fisher act. But I am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film. Don&#39;t spoil your opinion of Carrie by viewing it.&#34;,
   &#39;Rather than move linearly from beginning to end, this story line of a gay couple impacted by AIDS &#34;orbits&#34; in time around their &#34;perfect day.&#34; The film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The narration has its lyrical moments, particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced. The dialog unfortunately lacks such grace. The script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment. On their second accidental encounter, clearly smitten with each other, sensitive Phillip encourages a reluctant Guy to tell him about his difficult week. But the moment Guy begins to open up, Phillip, an English Major, blurts out &#34;You\&#39;re not a Crisis Fairy, are you?&#34; Later, watching his lover\&#39;s naked, chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him, our young Shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words, &#34;The way you cut through space....I can\&#39;t even describe it&#34;--but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought. This kind of drivel continues through the AIDS Hospice scenes, bejeweled with lines like, &#34;What made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons?&#34; and &#34;You make Florence Nightingale look like Nurse Ratchet.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety. Unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller-flattened than they need to be. Phillip\&#39;s thoroughly annoying friends--an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining, needy dweeb--maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path. Such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary, but sadly, their remarks are merely unpleasant, ungraced by wit or insight. It\&#39;s hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether\&#39;s perimeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film. It does seriously explore 1980\&#39;s US middle class gay life: first encounters, courting, coupling, nesting, the complexity of open relationships, friction and fracturing, dissolution, physical abuse, rapprochement, forgiveness, terminal illness, death and survival. Leads Phelan and Spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time. Their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film\&#39;s painful weaknesses. The decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out-of-sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility, and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could I recommend the film? To sticklers for literary and technical quality, absolutely not! For easy going viewers in serious need of an AIDS survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty-pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in, maybe. But better written alternatives exploring the impact of AIDS on relationships of that era include: Philadelphia, And the band played on, Longtime companion, Angels in America, An early frost, Parting glances, Love! Valour! Compassion! and even Jeffrey.&#39;,
   &#34;F*ck Me! I&#39;ve seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p*ss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I can&#39;t express in words how bad this film actually is. Besides the plot that isn&#39;t really there, the comically crap acting, the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this film is either stupid, pointless, crap or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... don&#39;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m ashamed to say, I have this on my rack. It&#39;s hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile. I couldn&#39;t even give this horse-sh*t excuse for a film away. That&#39;s how bad it is.&#34;,
   &#34;DVD has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit, the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like The Border. There were great expectations for this back in 1982 \x96 a script co-written by The Wild Bunch&#39;s Walon Green, Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast (Harvey Keitel, Warren Oates, Valerie Perrine), Tony Richardson directing (although he was pretty much a spent force by then) \x96 but now it doesn&#39;t even turn up on TV. The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption, with Nicholson&#39;s border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife&#39;s relentless materialism, until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. Unfortunately, he never really gets his hands dirty, barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and, sadly, the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original, nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film&#39;s trailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While that probably wasn&#39;t too convincing considering how low-key Nicholson&#39;s crisis of conscience is in the film, it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point he&#39;s holding characters at gunpoint, then he&#39;s somewhere else and they&#39;re free trying to kill him, one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrine&#39;s character gets dumber on an exponential level. The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease (and one impressive car stunt) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. Unfortunately Ry Cooder&#39;s beautiful title song, Across the Borderline, says it all much more economically. But if you want to know the film&#39;s real crime, it&#39;s completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part. When even he can&#39;t make an impression, you know something&#39;s really wrong. All in all, all too easy to remember why I found this so forgettable at the time.&#34;,
   &#34;Without a doubt one of the worst movies I&#39;ve seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with. It&#39;s tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops are on to us, they know who we are, what do we do?...Let&#39;s rob one more bank then we&#39;re outta here! What!?! Every character is a stereotype and it&#39;s easy to tell who&#39;s gonna end up dead.&#34;,
   &#34;East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It&#39;s a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop&#39;s self-image as a manly man. The story&#39;s about the gay man&#39;s life (which include flashbacks) are tolerable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for China&#39;s gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can&#39;t relate.&#34;,
   &#39;Chris Rock, apparently desperate for a cozy star-vehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences, updates the hit 1978 comedy &#34;Heaven Can Wait&#34; with an urban agenda. He plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his body--consequently, his angels must find another body to place him in, and can only come up with that of a white businessman. Rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as &#34;Heaven Can Wait&#34; only shows that Rock\&#39;s eye was on the box-office (this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of Hollywood players). Why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an Evening at the Apollo? Terrific supporting cast (including the usually-reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and terrific Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout. *1/2 from ****&#39;,
   &#39;I was at this film\&#39;s premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the writer/director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any. Rarely has a film been so poorly directed (why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes?), wretchedly acted (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional gamut from A to B. He parks at A and brings a lunch) and utterly pointless. Characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. At long last, the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that\&#39;s supposed to &#34;really make you think.&#34; Unfortunately, what it makes you think is, &#34;Well, there\&#39;s 90 minutes of my life I\&#39;m never getting back.&#34;&#39;,
   &#39;Even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans, it felt this was a combination of PC mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. Talk to those who have lived on horse back, most treat their animals like family members, regardless of background. Regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. I had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how PC showed a world different than what they knew in reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you may end up answering questions.&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;m going to say first off that I have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought. I was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count. But that would be about it. Let me explain. I paid literally £1 for this DVD in a supermarket because I tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks, B-movies especially. But if this film was aiming for B status as I suspect it was for a number of reasons (which I&#39;ll touch on in a sec) then it failed magnificently. Not only did it shoot for B and miss, it landed somewhere around F. This film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts. I say above that it&#39;s likely this film was aiming for B status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror, which can either be very good or very bad. For example, later Freddy films (Dream Warriors onwards) are all about Freddy&#39;s style and nose-thumbing, which works out great! But this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid. I will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good. In fact, for about half an hour I liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find. BUT what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills. For instance, when &#39;Satan&#39; smashes the cat against the board and writes &#39;boo&#39; with it&#39;s blood using its body as a brush. Or when &#39;Satan&#39; slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman. Now I&#39;m not usually too against senseless kills in films-hey, thats the point, right? But in those two cases I just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film-plot especially. For me, the film went downwards from then on. One major bad point about this film is that I hated every character in it. The kid, Dougie was just ridiculously annoying!!! I&#39;m at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick! I mean, come on!!! I completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid, like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help, but this kid took the biscuit! I wanted to kill him myself by the end of it! It was completely unbelievable and if I had to hear him say &#39;duh!&#39; one more time I was going to bang my head against a wall-because thats what watching this film felt like. Why didn&#39;t i just turn the film off? Mainly because I honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film. But I was wrong in this case. The ending did NOT redeem this film, it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line. I get it already! The killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else, be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume! I GET IT! This film made me physically angry because it was so stupid! And if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film, watch out for the intestines. Frankly, if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that, I&#39;d be surprised he wasn&#39;t already dead, let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I&#39;ll even go so far as to say that the only character I liked at all in this film was actually the killer. Purely because when his &#39;comedy routine&#39; worked, it did work. All in all, the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down. Why was the killer killing? I don&#39;t know. I can live without knowing who he actually was, thats fairly typical, but without some kind of motive - hell i don&#39;t know, i&#39;d settle for him having a bad Halloween as a kid! -it just seems more than senseless, just stupid. Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. In fact, i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with IMDb just so i could comment on it. Save your money, save your sanity. Stay away from it!&#34;,
   &#39;I can\&#39;t stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with Paris Hilton, and sure it\&#39;s his company. But &#34;you\&#39;re fired&#34; or &#34;you\&#39;re hired&#34;, for how many seasons now? After watching the show I wouldn\&#39;t want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;d love to hear just one person get up and say &#34;Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo&#34;. I see he\&#39;s even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I don\&#39;t have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. I\&#39;d give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it doesn\&#39;t deserve that.&#39;,
   &#34;On Steve Irwin&#39;s show, he&#39;s hillarious. He doesn&#39;t even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn&#39;t even what I would call a movie-I mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he&#39;s just saying &#39;Oh, this is one nasty bloke!&#39; and looking straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too much! And then when the guy falls off the car wouldn&#39;t you expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst acting I&#39;d ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve she just says &#39;Steve&#39;. She didn&#39;t sound scared or anything, it was just &#39;Steve&#39;. I mean I hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin but his movie was just too stupid.&#34;,
   &#39;This is surely one of the worst films ever made. Each scene is painful. You will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor, the awkward camera work, the sexism and racism, the ridiculous story line, the wooden acting. Poor Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment. In all, dreadful.&#39;,
   &#39;Oh man is this movie bad. It flows horribly. The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself, and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this, doesn\&#39;t love himself. He tries getting out of the contract and horrible, painfully unfunny gags ensue. Jim Nabors seems as if he\&#39;s sleepwalking, not acting. You\&#39;ll miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker. Loni Anderson\&#39;s hair is downright scary, proving that tons of hairspray didn\&#39;t go out in the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of, Burt\&#39;s wig wasn\&#39;t bad in this film. His worst &#34;wig day&#34; was in &#34;Smokey and the Bandit 2&#34;. Anyhow, this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie, ever, ever, right up there with &#34;Cannonball Run 2&#34;. The original &#34;Smokey&#34; and &#34;Cannonball&#34; (and &#34;Hooper&#34; which, thankfully, had no sequel) are great, funny films. This one isn\&#39;t. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. You\&#39;ll long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate. And mind you, this isn\&#39;t one of those fun movies to bag on. It\&#39;s lousy, pure and simple. Even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring, and worst of all, unfunny. And least I forget, &#34;Stroker Ace&#34; was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt\&#39;s coffin before his somewhat-revival years later in &#34;Boogie Nights&#34;, another film that, like &#34;Deliverance&#34; years earlier, shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.&#39;,
   &#34;I am 17, and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn&#39;t expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw of it, I wasn&#39;t impressed at all. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate had slightly better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero, something they would&#39;ve never had done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune wasn&#39;t very good either, I can&#39;t even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. Though, I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn&#39;t been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might I add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was awful, and I am not trying to discredit it, it&#39;s what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox&#34;,
   &#39;This adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester\&#39;s character. I get the feeling he never even read the book, just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read &#34;Grumpy, broody, murky past.&#34; He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave. GO AND REREAD THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. AND BY THE WAY: A &#34;PASSIONATE&#34; LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO EAT HER FACE.&#39;,
   &#34;I did not enjoy the film, Joshua, at all. Perhaps it is because I saw another, much better similar film titled Orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it&#39;s really just because this film was not very good. I am going with the ladder. Sure, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn&#39;t mean the film could not succeed. It could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building, boring, uneventful and really didn&#39;t leave me thinking anything more than &#39;that wasn&#39;t very good&#39; when it was all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end, Joshua&#39;s motivations are revealed. I won&#39;t give that away but the reality is that he didn&#39;t really accomplish his goals since despite Vera Farmiga as his mother, Abby, disappearing about 3/4th through the movie, all arrows point to her returning home soon. She was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then Joshua&#39;s Father/Her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically. So.. shouldn&#39;t she be coming home soon? Won&#39;t Joshua have failed? Won&#39;t his Mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his Father soon? I question the Father since his future is left open ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I didn&#39;t care about the characters. The evil demon child Joshua wasn&#39;t really scary. The storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring. Suspense fell flat every single time. When it was over I couldn&#39;t believe I had sat through the whole thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially Vera Farmiga as the Mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil &#39;child&#39; go see Orphan. Now that&#39;s a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie.&#34;,
   &#34;I would have given it a one instead of a two, but I suppose it COULD have been worse. I guess the acting isn&#39;t all that bad, but the plot lacks anything even remotely close to interesting. It is a terrible movie!! TERRIBLE! Complete waste of time! I strongly suggest you do not watch this movie.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#34;,
   &#34;If you&#39;re going to look after a child, make sure they don&#39;t live anywhere near a graveyard. Especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her &#39;friends&#39;. But, our long haired heroine, oblivious to all the signs, shacks up with her family the Nortons, which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter. Even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast&#39;s tendency to talk even when their lips aren&#39;t moving, and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths. But enough of that.. domestic animals are being sacrificed, old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won&#39;t shut up during any scene, even the quiet ones. Oh, and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather, smelt what they&#39;d signed up for and gone AWOL. Yes, I know it&#39;s hard to get into movies these days, but this sort of starter point is not one on your CV you&#39;d want. If would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting. Featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill Laurel Barnett, and another almost equally as bad by the charisma-free child actress Rosalie Cole (The next Dakota Fanning she ain&#39;t) the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed, while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood, a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on. But back up a minute.. earlier on they were in the car, and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it. So do they stay where they are safe? No of course not, they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere, so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she&#39;s having a nervous breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the film closes. It doesn&#39;t end, it just goes to a grinding halt. The main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood, as if nothing horrible had happened. But, my dear viewer, something horrible has happened. You have just sat through one of the most lamebrained, boring horror films you&#39;re ever likely to see, and lost 82 minutes of your life you&#39;ll never get back. Just think.. years from now on your deathbed, what you&#39;d trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family. Sadly, it&#39;s already too late for me. Don&#39;t you make the same mistake :( 2/10&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this movie the other night and I have to honestly say it\&#39;s one of the worst films I\&#39;ve ever seen. The acting is fair, but the plot is totally ridiculous. A killer is born because of all the &#34;energy used to make the movie&#34; and if the film is burned the killer will die? How unbelievable is that? The characters were underdeveloped to say the least...for example, all of a sudden the man mentions &#34;Aren\&#39;t you trying to complete the film because your mother couldn\&#39;t?&#34; So we\&#39;re supposed to go along with this? We had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film. The movie really didn\&#39;t spotlight on anyone, we didn\&#39;t know anything about the main people who survived except Ringwald\&#39;s character was a whiney actress, the guy was on the set when the people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like her mother. Not truly diving in to know who they are. Seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings. The whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap, obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making. I can\&#39;t believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture. It\&#39;s not funny, it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film. I found myself predicting what would happen before each scene, which believe you me wasn\&#39;t hard at all to do. It\&#39;s a disgrace and I\&#39;m deeply sorry I wasted an hour and a half watching the mess. 1/10.&#39;,
   &#34;What in God&#39;s name happened here? How does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of Redneck Zombies? Was Zombie &#39;90 ever supposed to entertain someone ...anyone, or even make a dollars profit? But mainly, what happened here? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zombie &#39;90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of Andreas Schnaas, who specializes in earth-shattering gore films, such as Goblet of Gore, and Anthropophagus 2000, and some of which contain profanity in the titles. In the gore department, this one isn&#39;t much different than the rest. Although, the level of ineptness ...well, earth-shattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zombie &#39;90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson&#39;s Dead-Alive is gory, think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time. An accident, involving chemicals causes the dead to come back, and eat the living. Never has the concept been treated in such a manner. The gore effects are a whole, new low. Just a Z-grade nightmare. I can&#39;t tell whether, or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow, I doubt the English dubbing was being very true to the original script, but stranger things have happened. The whole thing just reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction to a Troma movie, except it lasts a hell of a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve seen only one film that was worse than this, The Chooper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For proof that Andreas Schnaas is an actual director, I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie, give Extreme Pestilence a try, but you&#39;ve been warned. It takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through. But if gore is all you&#39;re here for, then you might be able to stomach this one. Other than that, no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 7/5/09: After a few more viewings of Zombie &#39;90, I&#39;ve had a change of heart, or I guess I just get it now. Zombie &#39;90 is hilarious, so nevermind the harsh words, Although, Extreme Pestilence still only deserves one star.&#34;,
   &#34;I remember watching this film back in 86&#39; when it first came out &amp; what an awful film. The acting was atrocious the plot was so flimsy it would or is that should have blew away in a breath of wind. I think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion &amp; i was not tired that i remember. Please avoid at all costs better still have all your teeth taken out with no anaesthetic cos that would be more entertaining. It&#39;s just a pity i couldn&#39;t give it a zero or a negative score. I wish i had not wasted my money getting this one from the video shop all i can say was that the tape it was on was still brand new practically hardly surprising as the film was so poor. If i remember right i sat &amp; watched it with a girl i really wanted to go out with &amp; the fact she was sat next to me was still not enough to keep me awake thats how bad this film was.&#34;,
   &#34;Sogo Ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a scion of the Genji clan. The film-making has the main hallmarks of a low-budget production, including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages (the kind you might find in an under-produced dorama). The monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards Gojoe bridge at night, but he doesn&#39;t realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time - but which could earn him enlightenment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no absence of ambitiousness, however, in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly. Artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film-making style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A disappointment.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie barely followed the story line of the movie. All of the fascinating points in the book didn\&#39;t even exist in the movie. They ended up turning it into a cheesy &#34;tween&#34; Disney movie &#34;crush&#34; story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad it should have been Hillary Duff playing the part, or one of the likes. This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can\&#39;t believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap, basic rendition. If you\&#39;ve ever read the book, I think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; equivalence. This movie should have never been able to use the title of A Wrinkle in Time. Poorly done.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie was amazingly bad. I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve ever seen a movie where every attempt at humor failed as miserably. Let\&#39;s see...the acting was pathetic, the &#34;special effects&#34; where horrible, the plot non-existant...that pretty much sums up this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;*review may contain spoilers*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feeling to it. the idea of the UN as being taken over by Satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible. the premise is interesting, but its excution falls waaaay short. if you want to convert people to Christianity with a film like this, at least make it a quality one! i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck. can&#39;t say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago, and there isn&#39;t really much to say about this film other than.....skip it!&#34;,
   &#34;A great concept gone wrong. Poor acting, even worse writing....After watching the first two episodes I was wondering why it ever made it to season two. The characters are forgettable, the writing is poor, the sets are just OK. The special effects are simply sad - so much better has been made in the same time-frame - where is the money going on this one? The first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast - the precept of the whole show is just silly. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I am a huge Sci-Fi fan and &#39;geek&#39; - but this show simply doesn&#39;t cut it. As I said in the beginning, I am truly surprised it made it to season two - so much better has been canceled after only one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This show was just bad.&#34;,
   &#39;The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of &#34;posh totty&#34; to have been committed to celluloid. Of her era and ilk, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close. What was it about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, the movie is very poor and being of its time, very cheaply made. The song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling.&#39;,
   &#39;A huge hit upon release with Australian audiences, it can still be funny today, but its over-the-top political incorrectness and blunt, unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer. It goes on far too long; some of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; the content could have been saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, which desperately needed some new stuff anyway. Granted, his ocker Aussie attitude is funny, but also becomes annoying as the film drags on. Some say Crocker\&#39;s songs are the best bits, and they are certainly original, but &#34;hilarious&#34;? The Adventures of Barry McKenzie will go down as a landmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or, for that matter, Mick Dundees!). Rating: 5/10&#39;,
   &#39;A little girl\&#39;s dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed to be the body of a couple\&#39;s missing daughter. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence. All of this changes when one day, many years later, she receives a phone call from her daughter! With the help of an ex-cop and a reporter, she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive. &#34;Los Sin Nombre&#34; is a mess plot-wise, moves at an achingly slow pace, and is completely unscary. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the ending, but I\&#39;m not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film. Beware of the English subtitles on the recent R1 release--they aren\&#39;t very accurate.&#39;,
   &#39;I read comments about this being the best Chinese movie ever. Perhaps if the only Chinese movies you\&#39;ve seen contained no dialogue, long drawn-out far-away stares and silences, and hack editing, then you\&#39;re spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complicated story-line? Hardly. Try juvenile and amateurish. Exquisite moods and haunting memories? Hardly. Try flat-out boring and trite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was awful. I could not wait for it to be over. Particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of &#34;How are you? I\&#39;m fine. Are you sure? Yes.&#34; Wow! What depth of character. I guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a huge fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed in this. Even Zhang\&#39;s sentimentally sappy &#34;The Road Home&#34; was better than this.&#39;,
   &#39;As someone who lived through,and still remembers that decade vividly,if the actual \&#39;70s had been half this funny and (semi)normal,they would have been so much more enjoyable.Actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright-eyed and normal as these kids did.The country\&#39;s youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that \&#39;60s rebellion that it spawned,especially in the behavior department;the petulance,the smugness,the self-righteousness,the childishness,the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters exhibit any of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone compared to &#34;Happy Days&#34;,and I can see why:They were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast,and they both offer only surface ,cliched depictions of the actual eras,not even close to the full scope of it,just showing the obvious things - the fashions,toys,music,contraptions,etc,and that\&#39;s it.For those too young to remember,or weren\&#39;t born then,trust me,the \&#39;70s weren\&#39;t like that,any more than &#34;Happy Days&#34; were like the actual \&#39;50s,as &#34;M*A*S*H*&#34; didn\&#39;t accurately portray life at a US Army medical base during the Korean War,etc.&#39;,
   &#39;What do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are excruciatingly long, terrible lighting, painful editing, and awful effects? You get Jessica: A Ghost Story Seems its shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this medium. In this case it does not. There are a few CU\&#39;s where the person\&#39;s face is entirely in shadow. One scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists. It\&#39;s a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half... but I guess then they wouldn\&#39;t have a film at feature length. The main character is incredibly flat. He\&#39;s the LEAD male, so he should have some &#34;hero&#34; elements to his character, but he does not. He whines and is scared the entire film. I could go on, but I don\&#39;t want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they did have nice camera movement. Too bad the lighting didn\&#39;t compliment it. The cover of the DVD is nice, and that\&#39;s where it ends. Just terrible.&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;m a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I&#39;ve seen in some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To have a good movie, you need to have a well-written screenplay. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing, it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film, but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, there is zero character development. When characters in the story get saved (I won&#39;t say who), the book makes it clear that it&#39;s a long, soul-searching process. In the film it&#39;s quick and artificial. The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind (again, I won&#39;t say who), it seems artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize as a Christian it&#39;s unedifying for me to say I disliked this film, but I can&#39;t in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would&#39;ve been better to make the first book into 2-3 films. Either way, Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind, but that&#39;s the way I see it.&#34;,
   &#34;9, the film I&#39;ve been looking forward to for months.... was little more then a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was deeply surprised by 9&#39;s lack of story and strange character development. All the awesome action sequences in the world don&#39;t make up for a single unsympathetic character. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strange, almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place, they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How, what, when, why.... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd. Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 could have been awesome... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators.&#34;,
   &#34;I love Dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when i was younger, and i thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I don&#39;t know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, looks, attraction and the evil underneath that. Or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But can you imagine Dracula with an snobbish English accent and the body language to go along with it? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension..? Then this is a movie for you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise - don&#39;t see it! I only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home. Cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid, and i think that sums up the whole thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe you like this film because of it&#39;s place in Dracula cinema history, perhaps being fascinated by how the Dracula story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Cause as movie it isn&#39;t that appealing, it doesn&#39;t pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the Vampyre myth so fascinating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it. The scenery looks like cheap Theatre. And i don&#39;t say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies. Cause i can love old film as well as new.&#34;,
   &#34;Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. Some feature extensive effects work, others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it&#39;s painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $750,000 if not considerably less than that. Few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly directed, poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P.T. Barnum.&#34;,
   &#39;Boy oh boy oh golly gee,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create Mom\&#39;s &#34;invisibility.&#34; They looked like they were shot on cheap video, and it looks totally unreal, and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT end up loving this movie. The attempted &#34;steadicam&#34; shots were really pathetic as well. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget flick, that\&#39;s fine. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. But, a BAD movie and a low budget AND effects. That makes for a bad combination. In this case, such a doomed combo created the craptastic film, &#34;Invisible Mom.&#34; If you have kids, and your kids have no taste, perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one.&#39;,
   &#34;While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review, I really didn&#39;t like this film even though it had so many similarities. Both were made just a few years apart, both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies. However, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, overall, just seemed like a cheaper film--with poor writing, little energy and some VERY broad performances--even when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this A-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio. Plus, there wasn&#39;t much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grant--an actor generally loved for his grace and class. It&#39;s sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.&#34;,
   &#39;This is a typical &#34;perfect crime&#34; thriller. A perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who guilty is. The audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. The result is like every single episode of &#34;Columbo&#34; or &#34;murder she wrote&#34;. The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock! This story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book. Skip this one, you are not missing anything.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m not sure this is a spoiler; perhaps it is a public service. If you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits, you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer\&#39;s voice-over, which states the U.S. has just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945 to end WWII. Here are just a few of the problems with this close: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)The older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more UNHOLY movies in their mind\&#39;s eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)The average person will really kick themselves that they did not &#34;watch&#34; one of these UNHOLY fill-in-the-blanks flicks created in their own head for free, instead of shelling out time and money to see this UNHOLY from the video store (or on cable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)This end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about WWII, leading them to the conclusion that George W. Bush is the latest heir to the Nazi throne.&#39;,
   &#39;...and you can look at that statement in different ways, by the way. First of all, it\&#39;s a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes. Your wildest imagination doesn\&#39;t even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick, disgusting, offensive, brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. Now, I love horror movies and I am very \&#39;pro-violence\&#39;, but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. The &#34;movie&#34; contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. This results in endless showing of torture, murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. Not very informative, if you ask me. And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential. It\&#39;s about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. Personally, I think that is an interesting topic, so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the whole production of this movie was a mess. They didn\&#39;t have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts...Tons of it !! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I\&#39;ve ever seen. Any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish ( Like that attempt to a realistic car crash, for example ). There\&#39;s no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere...not even an attempt to build up one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least. With the presence of death-metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth..get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial. Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this. And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing...Bah. I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you\&#39;re easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind. For every self-respecting horror fan, this movie is an insult.&#39;,
   &#39;(Spoilers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very curious to see this film, after having heard that it was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole film were two things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if, by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the overall sloppiness of the production, with dialogues that were barely understandable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad.&#39;,
   &#39;The plot line of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest. But, throughout watching this film, we were saying aloud, &#34;These filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations, the lighting is good, makeup and hair are good...why is the sound so bad?&#34; Throughout the film the sound was echoy, garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some good acting in this film, and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a high-budget film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can\&#39;t reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget, dedicate more to good sound. Sound is as much a part of a film as the image, and it\&#39;s worth doing right. Could\&#39;ve earned a 6.&#39;,
   &#39;There are two groups of people...those who love every Fellini movie they see and normal people. While I will admit that I have really enjoyed some of his films, I can also honestly say that I can\&#39;t stand some of them. My opinion, by the way, is not just some knee-jerk reaction--I have seen most of Fellini\&#39;s films and have also seen many films by the world\&#39;s most famous directors. With this in mind, I feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both Godard and Fellini. They both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the &#34;intelligensia&#34;, while the average person would never sit through some of their films. Heck, even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films. So, since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses, it\&#39;s not surprising that their films are so often praised--it\&#39;s like a cult! If you don\&#39;t believe me, think about many of Godard\&#39;s films such as FIRST NAME CARMEN or ALPHAVILLE,...or what about FELLINI SATYRICON or JULIET OF THE SPIRITS? These films abound with boredom, weirdness and incomprehensibility. Now I am NOT saying a film can\&#39;t be weird (after all I love HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS and SHAOLIN SOCCER), but it must be watchable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to this movie. Somehow, Fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy. This is no small task--it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable. Instead of cheap sexual thrills, the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of Casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that Donald Sutherland looks like a ghoul. I know some of this must have been Fellini\&#39;s intention, but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance--especially since Sutherland\&#39;s lines are all poorly dubbed into Italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself! Unfortunately, when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades, there really isn\&#39;t anything else to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of Fellini\&#39;s wife, Giulietta Masina. Considering that in addition to this, that in previous decades Fellini had Masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman, it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen. I read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well. This is about the only aspect of this turgid film that I found at all interesting. Don\&#39;t say I didn\&#39;t warn you!&#39;,
   &#39;Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about three 20 second cameos and what is Gene Barry doing all over this movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that makes no sense whatsoever. The inept writer/director (same dude) butchered up everyone\&#39;s talent with his horrendous uh...work. I got the DVD for a penny so can\&#39;t complain! But it\&#39;s weird!And it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way. This was the 70\&#39;s and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it\&#39;s like to be inside his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it quickly plays foul. It has that &#34;Manson family on acid&#34; vibe to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie? Maybe they worked in it back when? At any rate, be prepared to lose 80+ min of your life you\&#39;ll never get back. Yes, it\&#39;s that awful!&#39;,
   &#34;I have to say this is an awful movie, for the mere fact that when you see this movie on the guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I watched it, I started laughing, thinking to myself, does this guy actually expect me to believe this is real? So I had to look it up, and now see that it is a movie, but now since it isn&#39;t a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting. SO, either way, it is pretty bad. I actually didn&#39;t make it to the end. I had to shut it off. I am a NYC Police Officer, and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers. So, I took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded by that, and it isn&#39;t as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.&#34;,
   &#39;At the end of &#34;Dragon Heat,&#34; all I could think of was why I bothered sitting through the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s premise is interesting and that - as well as Maggie Q - is what attracted me to the film in the first place. But was I ever disappointed. Writer-director Daniel Lee can\&#39;t hold a candle to the likes of John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be one of the most annoyingly-directed films I have ever seen. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I use that phrase incredibly loosely - that he fills the film with completely needless black-and-white stills, freeze frames, slow-motion, fast-motion and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hopped-up music video more than anything else. There is little to care about any of the characters - including two supposedly professional snipers who couldn\&#39;t hit the broad side of a barn from the inside! - who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is devoid of any twists and turns - from the initial set-up, everything unfolds in predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters\&#39; back stories in case we didn\&#39;t get it the first several times. This is awfully amateurish writing and film-making and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Though, to be frank, I am hard-pressed to remember Biehn being in any good film that was not directed by James Cameron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really are in the mood for a great Hong Kong actioner, you are much better off sticking to some of the staples - John Woo\&#39;s &#34;The Killer&#34; (1989) and &#34;Hard-Boiled&#34; (1992), Ringo Lam\&#39;s &#34;City on Fire&#34; (1987) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for &#34;Reservoir Dogs&#34; (1992) - or his &#34;Point Blank&#34; (1967) remake, &#34;Full Contact&#34; (1992). Or, even check out Yuen\&#39;s &#34;So Close&#34; (2002), a supremely entertaining, yet preposterous, popcorn flick. And there\&#39;s always the terrific French police actioner, &#34;The Nest&#34; (2002).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, most, if not all, are a bit over-the-top, but they were films that remain exciting, thrilling and even suspenseful. They have characters we care about and mind-blowing action sequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Dragon Heat,&#34; on the other hand, is just terribly mediocre. The trouble is that Lee has not made a bad action film, he has made a dull one.&#39;,
   &#39;Awlright, damn it, the MooCow will grudgingly admit the truth: I kinda\&#39; like this cheap, cheesy 70\&#39;s parody. The idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the US is a great idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie does provide some decent chuckles, moostly the sight of terrified extras running away from large, obviously fake tomatoes. This film, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earlier attempts at spoofs, which became so popular in the 80\&#39;s &amp; 90\&#39;s, thanks largely to Airplane!. This one, like moost spoofs, is pretty poor. Many attempts at humor are dismal failures, and will induce much groaning. But thanks to the ravenous tomatoes hordes, the obnoxious &#34;Puberty Love&#34; song, and the awesome helicopter crash scene, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes does provide some goods, though largely for the wrong reasons. There are sooooo many things wrong with this film...and so right, it\&#39;s hard to explain. Enough people must also have enjoyed it as the Tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films, and a cartoon series!! Large chunks of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty dull. And dig those 70\&#39;s clothes, dude!! ;=8) This tomato is seedy and cheesy, but worth a chuckle or two; the MooCow says grab a pizza and pop in the Tomatoes!! :\x8d&#39;,
   &#39;The lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the &#34;I do\&#39;s&#34; with fiancé Henry(Paul Rudd). After two years Henry has yet to move on and his sister Chloe(Lindsay Sloane)is very concerned. Chloe arranges for Henry to talk with an attractive psychic Ashley(Lake Bell). Ashley is to contact Kate\&#39;s spirit hoping to help Henry get on with his life. When the psychic starts getting attracted to Henry, Kate\&#39;s ghost appears to nip the romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you\&#39;ve seen the trailers you have seen the substance of the film. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought that Bell stole the show from Parker. And Biggs as usual a pain in the butt. Still this movie was over-hyped.&#39;,
   &#34;I purchased this film for $5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only, Chase Masterson, but I should have crumbled up the five, thrown it in a toilet and flushed. The film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death, who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died. There problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one. The acting is abysmal, these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old. The entire set looks like someone&#39;s backyard in Malibu. The people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and/or actors. Avoid this pile of garbage at ALL costs.&#34;,
   &#34;I go to the cinema to be entertained. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film. From beginning to end, there is no respite from the gray, grinding reality of this woman&#39;s life. It is one-paced, with no change of mood. I remained until the end only because I was convinced that things must get better. They don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t think I was the only one, as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close. Honestly depicting social depravation is no crime, but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public. A dreadful film.&#34;,
   &#39;I have two very major complaints regarding this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. That my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the &#34;suspense&#34; category. (Had I known what it was, I would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place. And yes, this movie is a soft core porn.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. No one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, make that three major complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. That I for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list. Boy do I regret that. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This movie is valueless on virtually every level.&#39;,
   &#39;I regret every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie, really. Unhappily, I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it. Especially, when it\&#39;s such a classic or what people use to call a classic. I think that this is one of those movies every movie-lover should have watched at least one time, so that was why I watched it. Don\&#39;t get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion. No really good plot, neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres. Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether \&#39;Bogey\&#39; and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another. I think &#34;To Have and Have Not&#34; is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the 1940s.&#39;,
   &#39;First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES...I don\&#39;t read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). I am simply a fan of the films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. Taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it\&#39;s terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I don\&#39;t understand how you can say this is an amazing movie. For all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie R2 suddenly being a badass, and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch), HORRIBLE acting, and noted plot holes...how is this good? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the &#34;NOOOOOO!&#34; Frankenstein scene). When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is NOT A GREAT MOVIE. For a film with such a &#34;dark&#34; tone, there was too much levity in the speech of ALL characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I close with a question: From the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?&#39;,
   &#39;Discovery Channel/Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves. This Fantasy is modeled after the &#34;Walking with Dinosuars&#34; series. Even though this is 100% fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T-rexs and the extinction of the dinos. Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say Sci-Fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes. But the way in which it is presented I have to give it a 1/10. Don\&#39;t get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong. I can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think this weakens the great &#34;Walking with Dinosuars&#34; series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series.&#39;,
   &#39;I give this marriage 3 years and thats stretching it. Adrianne Curry is fouled mouth, spoiled, controlling, loud, and her bi sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending. Her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth. Here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce. I don\&#39;t think his old &#34; Brady Family&#34; is gonna fit into his new life. I see them being shut out. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. The supported him and was there for him.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress. His head is chopped off and buried separately of his body...sounds like &#34;The Thing that wouldn\&#39;t die&#34; doesn\&#39;t it? Well it does play out a little like that, but once the body is reunited with the head, all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly. I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking &#34;When is it going to end&#34;? The characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery. The only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track. Still I want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable. And don\&#39;t read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town, there isn\&#39;t...only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless. So for the most part I say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap.&#39;,
   &#39;First, I am not really a fan of the whole &#34;things eating flesh in disgusting new ways&#34; genre of film but I am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever. This one. So we start watching it. First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod! Second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man! Third, none of the dialogue makes any sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe the director (and my next door neighbor) are in need of psychological help. It\&#39;s funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast. It\&#39;s so amateurish it\&#39;s like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook.... with zombies. A note to anyone involved with this movie - I want the 20 minutes of my life I spent watching this, before I fell asleep, back.&#39;,
   &#34;There are some Stallone movies I like, but this movie didn&#39;t meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days. Also, in all this wilderness Stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short-cuts or plot devices. Also, the Treasury cops don&#39;t seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. Also, bad guys who couldn&#39;t hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked John Lithgow&#39;s villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn&#39;t care at all about any of his own bad guys, or all of them getting killed. Eventually I just couldn&#39;t believe the character anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price of a rental, not even worth taking the time to watch.&#34;,
   &#39;I have to admit that I stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen, besides the dead body in the first scenes... and her disposal of him. I was wrong. It was a cinema verite of Betty hits the Beach encased for the first part by Mordant Morven. I really don\&#39;t care what young lassies from Scotland do these days, who thy screw, what drugs they take. Visually, the stroll through the Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me. The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend. As the movie came to a close I had two thoughts... 1. That\&#39;s all there is? 2. Now I see why her boyfriend killed himself. Rename it. &#34;Bare Bitch Boredom, or What I did on my trip to Spain.&#34; I\&#39;m such a sucker for sticking these things out.&#39;,
   &#39;I really didn\&#39;t have high expectations and I must admit that I wasn\&#39;t disappointed. This movie is so terrible that I felt obligated to register an account here at IMDb just to warn others not to waste their time. The storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie &#34;can it get any worse?&#34; YES, it can! somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking &#34;I want my 1 hour 35 minutes back!&#34;. Somebody got to pay for this! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dare you to find a movie which is worst that this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn\&#39;t have high expectations and I must admit that I wasn\&#39;t disappointed.

   &#39;WOW is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it. trust me watch it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny! I cant believe they superimposed the school sign! I must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time. If a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies. even the costume was bad. it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it. heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well. all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first. its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done. hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out, just not like this one.&#39;,
   &#34;Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you&#39;re a better person than me! This movie, while a great attempt at &#39;imitating&#39; Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls very short of honoring them, or even being a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from old L+H movies and planted in unrealistically, the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars, Pinchot&#39;s accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie&#39;s accent, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? Editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap sets?), and overall it&#39;s a terrible thing to witness. It&#39;s even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950&#39;s era writing and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can, and learn how things WERE. You know what a MAGNATE is, don&#39;t you? Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pity anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update/honor of the boys. Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG?!? Why ruin &#39;Here&#39;s another fine mess&#39;? Why skip &#39;any the wiser&#39;? Why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ???? WHY MUST LARRY HARMON BE IN IT? WHY BOZO!? And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, really. Fart jokes, for God&#39;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FART JOKES.&#34;,
   &#34;Just picked up this film for a buck at National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I feel like I got ripped-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve seen a worse film than this. Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of a film had I not such enormous respect for the subject matter, that is, Stephen Foster and his music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, what is it? It&#39;s a musical biography? Yeah, lot&#39;s of tunes by Foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers that reek more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, somebody got PAID to write this drivel? Secondly, the REAL story of Foster is a fascinating one. Why not even come CLOSE to it? Thirdly, what did they have on the great Ray Middleton to get him to do this film? Pictures of him with small boys?? With communists? What a waste of a great talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, friends of Foster, and the truth, and good entertainment, be afraid... be very, very, afraid.&#34;,
   &#39;Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. This was such a bad movie, about such and interesting true story. It had such promise, but the acting was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something out of a theme park. I found myself laughing as I watched, what was suppose to be, serious scenes. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn\&#39;t. The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the &#34;King&#34; dying. I liked the Queens\&#39; punishment. And, the final shot made a beautiful picture, though. There are so many better movies to watch. I don\&#39;t recommend this.&#39;,
   &#39;I do not believe all the praise for this movie. The play and movie were a ripoff of Sleuth. Michael Caine wishes he were Olivier, and Reeves wishes he were Caine. Caine even had the nerve to do a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original part. Jude Law? You mean the one that did the remake of &#34;Alfie&#34;? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was made during a period of Caine\&#39;s career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would star in such award winning movies such as this, and &#34;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure&#34;. What seems to be driving the praise for this movie is Reeves death. He deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie. And so does Caine. This movie can be found in the $5.97 bin at Walmart. Along with gems like &#34;The Island&#34;, and &#34;Blame it on Rio&#34;.&#39;,
   &#34;I decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the BBC in the weeks prior to it starting. I watched it despite the fact that I don&#39;t like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry to his fans but I think we have a case of the emperor&#39;s new clothes with this author&#39;s work). I admit that the acting is excellent, it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it - however- I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production. The &#39;explicit&#39; gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on TV - several times - so it was nothing very shocking I&#39;m afraid. Full marks for production values but low ones for storyline/content I&#39;m afraid.&#34;,
   &#39;Poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original setups, it uses the same closet/under the bed/person-behind-you-in-the-mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring, and NOT in a foreshadowing way either, and the fact that NOBODY ever &#34;really&#34; gets killed (at least not on screen) , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve MORE cheated for spending money on their admission ticket....its a horror film w/o any horror LMAO. The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this, or you were high/drunk at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I have a life and don\&#39;t bother writing reviews that often unless I really really hated something, or enjoyed it tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this film is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty of sorts to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one thing to rent a &#34;bad&#34; movie at blockbuster from the Weinsteins, its another when you have to sit through it in a theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in case you want some remake nostalgia, forget it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a re-imagining. It is not scary, nor engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be &#34;funny&#34; like others on IMDb have claimed...it is just stale and booooring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what you will take away from this film: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow\&#39;s head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST be having some sexual affair with J.S. Cardone of &#34;The Forsaken&#34; to have gotten another role as a killer(because he is as frightening as my poodle, and too cute to kill just about anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of person would NOT get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn\&#39;t show up? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste you\&#39;re money like I did. The &#34;original&#34; sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, though no way near as bad as this piece of crap (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but once you see this, you will understand why I say what I say).&#39;,
   &#39;This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case, here. There\&#39;s an agreeable amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart\&#39;s weapons, but the editing film is a seriously disjointed, the film-making itself rougher than usual. At times, the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the &#34;cub,&#34; who nearly gets lost early on. All in all, disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there\&#39;s a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers. This installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy, who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.&#39;,
   &#39;This piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor film making aside, the story is vile just sick evil sh*t If you like rape, murder and self harm this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed. I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out. Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty.&#39;,
   &#34;I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she did very well acting her role. Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host, and model, it was not surprising. I was left wondering why she was killed, and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#39;t really sure about the genre of this movie, and although I liked the actors I felt like it was for a college audience. I tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn&#39;t my favorite genre, but felt like I had outgrown the gags. It seemed to drag out in some places, leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had, and, like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having written a couple of scripts, I know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions, how many movies you have seen &amp; studied, and those you relate with at a point in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I found it interesting, but not a satisfying plot and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone&#39;s ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating.&#34;,
   &#39;Although the likeliness of someone focusing on THIS comment among the other 80+ for this movie is low, I feel that I have to say something about this one. I am not the kind of movie-watcher who pays attention to production value, thought-provoking dialog, or brilliant acting &amp; directing. However, I claim that this movie sucks. I don\&#39;t know why I don\&#39;t like it... I mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie: blood, outrageousness, unintentional humor, etc. According to this evidence it should be my favorite. Still, Zombi 3 is a baaad movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just too many things that compels you to yell at the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water (this spoils nothing so don\&#39;t worry). She walks into what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Did she not see that there was a friggin\&#39; lake in the middle of the building??? Yes she\&#39;s looking for water and passes up a lake. Why? Cuz she wants to know why the people (who aren\&#39;t there cuz the place is abandoned) won\&#39;t answer her when she calls out: &#34;Is anybody there?&#34; Oh this is just a little, insignificant piece of the big picture I\&#39;m painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason, though, why I gave this film more than 1 star. It\&#39;s one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is, like I have a few times, you\&#39;ll want to watch it again because it\&#39;s just so over-the-top in every aspect. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has an ocean of gore. Also, it has pretty weird creatures in it as well: a zombie-baby (with an adult-size hand???) and a magically flying head to name just two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know when you try to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with \&#39;50\&#39;s sci-fi movies? I believe that Zombi 3 and movies like it should top those. It has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies battling monsters, and so on. This IS the Plan 9 of the \&#39;80\&#39;s! While I won\&#39;t say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, just expect the very worst. And when you find out that expecting the worst is underestimating Zombi 3, it won\&#39;t be all that bad. You might actually like it, I\&#39;m not saying that\&#39;s impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t think I hate this movie, I don\&#39;t... really. Oh, P.S. Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5) rules! (did I just blow my credibility?)&#39;,
   &#39;A never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film. The &#34;Blonde Wig&#34; half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self-indulgence by its makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Wong Faye half (featuring a very playful, if Karen Carpenter looking, Faye Wong) holds much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the girl-meets-boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness. Character development is uneven. Emotion is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For music lovers, Wong Faye\&#39;s &#34;Mung Jung Yun&#34; (Cantonese version of the Cranberry\&#39;s smash hit &#34;Dreams&#34;) is used effectively in Chungking Express. Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin language version called &#34;Zhen Tuo.&#34; Both are on CD, although only &#34;Mung Jung Yun&#34; is found on the official movie soundtrack CD.&#39;,
   &#39;I rented the dubbed-English version of Lensman, hoping that since it came from well-known novels it would have some substance. While there were hints of substance in the movie, it mostly didn\&#39;t rise above the level of kiddie cartoon. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or maybe even the source novels were lightweight. But for whatever reason, there wasn\&#39;t much there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed lots of details that were derivative, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise deficient. Some examples: The opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 &#34;star gate&#34; scene and the Star Wars image of hyperspace. The robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized &#34;R2-D2&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of Star Wars, but mercifully (since the humor doesn\&#39;t work) gives up on comedy and plays it serious. In that sense, it\&#39;s superior to the Star Wars franchise, which started with a clever sense of humor, and eventually deteriorated to Jar-Jar\&#39;s annoying silliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. The harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field, dumping silage onto unharvested crops, rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already-harvested rows or into a truck. Corn (maize) was pouring out the grain chute, but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was time for Kim\&#39;s father had to face his fate, there wasn\&#39;t any dramatic weight to the scene. That could have been partly the fault of the English-language voice actor, but the drawings didn\&#39;t show much weight either. Kim\&#39;s reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, even though they were apparently supposed to have been close. (Henderson\&#39;s death is no spoiler; his name isn\&#39;t revealed until his death scene.) She seems to promptly forget him. Someone\&#39;s expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does. I think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case; there\&#39;s at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of Chris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On several occasions, villains fail to accomplish their orders. A villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths. I can\&#39;t say whether that\&#39;s lifted from Star Wars, or if that comes from an earlier source -- possibly the Lensman books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s a scene where a space ship crash-lands. As it plunges toward the ground, parts are break off the ship. But so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in most cases Chris seems like a competent, tough space hero, there\&#39;s a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress. Someone tough enough to get over Henderson\&#39;s death so quickly should at least be able to shout, &#34;help, it\&#39;s got me and I can\&#39;t reach my gun!&#34; instead of just shrieking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The character with the most personality (almost too much at times) is D.J. Bill. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, the D.J. in American Graffiti. I wonder if he\&#39;s as well-voiced in the original language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two planets in the movie exploded. The explosions were unimpressive, and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to Star Wars. To its credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the Death Star\&#39;s primary weapon. The dialog had a good, interesting explanation for the cause. Many other explosions in the movie did look good, just not the planetary explosions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game. Some of the images look like primitive video games, and some influence from Tron is visible too. On the other hand, the sound effects are often pretty decent, although that emphasizes the cheesy-sounding parts. The art is good too, particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy-looking computer graphics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there\&#39;s the story. If a movie tells a good story, it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings. But the plot here was pretty lightweight. A naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship, and acquires a great power he doesn\&#39;t understand. He and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful, unredeemably evil enemy. He makes friends, learns about his special power, and grows into a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous enough, he might even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline, but there\&#39;s very little more than that in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it\&#39;s just a kiddie cartoon. But then, since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children, maybe it doesn\&#39;t need to be anything more than that.&#39;,
   &#39;Be warned: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe. Their roles are in fact minor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, with neither being really engaging. Especially I find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist, not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fiancé. The plot drags terribly, and I turned this one off after about 2/3 - unusual for me, as I like to finish what I start. The good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10&#39;,
   &#39;Nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing! This time, it\&#39;s being brought to you by the never-inevitable Fred Olen Ray! As far as exploitation movies go, this one doesn\&#39;t click! As science fiction, it\&#39;s plain unoriginal! All that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the Earth, and showing off all that\&#39;s nearly bare to resist! Give me a f---ing break!!! If this kind of entertainment is your thing, then why not dust off those old SI swimsuit mags from the attic for a change?! This would have been much better if it didn\&#39;t set the sleaze factor on very high, but that still wouldn\&#39;t make this one great. I\&#39;d like to point out another film called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR. It illustrates why top-notch 1st-person &#34;femme fatale&#34; action movies don\&#39;t translate well in America. Sorry, fellas!&#39;,
   &#39;VAMPYRES &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspect ratio: 1.85:1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound format: Mono&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and becomes enmeshed in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle, but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied lust for human blood...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director Jean Rollin in France, and consolidated by the success of Hammer\&#39;s &#34;Carmilla&#34; series in the UK, Jose Ramon Larraz\&#39; daring shocker VAMPYRES pushed the concept of Adult Horror much further than British censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974, and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original British release. It isn\&#39;t difficult to see why! Using its Gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the film\&#39;s short running time will allow, Larraz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym \&#39;D. Daubeney\&#39;) uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life, death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot on location at a picturesque country house during the Autumn of 1973, Harry Waxman\&#39;s haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding, in which the desolate countryside - bleak and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with SYMPTOMS, a low-key thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel). However, despite its pretensions, VAMPYRES\&#39; wafer-thin plot and rough-hewn production values will divide audiences from the outset, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished, the male lead (Brown, past his prime at the time of filming) is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud. A must-see item for cult movie fans, an amusing curio for everyone else, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Watch out for silent era superstar Bessie Love in a brief cameo at the end of the movie.&#39;,
   &#39;An ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting, if only you could bring yourself to care. This &#34;twisting and turning&#34; I speak of refers not to the story (which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole) but to the director\&#39;s inability to keep the characters\&#39; faces even remotely centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it. When you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all-star cast, you might be inclined to think something stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And indeed, it does.&#39;,
   &#39;This is a very old and cheaply made film--a typical low-budget B-Western in so many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of John Wayne that were done for &#34;poverty row&#34; studios. With both actors, their familiar style and persona were still not completely formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper doesn\&#39;t seem exactly like the Cooper of just a few years later (he talks faster in this early film, among other things).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, unlike the average B-movie of the era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you ever want to see the woman that was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very, very odd casting choice, as she has a heavy accent (she was French) and wasn\&#39;t even close to being &#34;movie star pretty&#34;. Incidentally, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me, the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot--sort of like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (and we thought this was a NEW idea). Gary Cooper\&#39;s character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep Cooper clear of females. This misogyny alone doesn\&#39;t necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls--with his arms cradled around him! This was pretty edgy stuff for the time and I think this makes this dull film really fascinating today! As far as Cooper and the plot go, the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip-able. Unless you are curious about Damita or the homosexual undertones, do yourself a favor and find a better Western.&#39;,
   &#34;This was a new alltime low among westerns. The writing is excruciatingly bad, characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland, the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed. And Tobey Maguire shows us the flip side of his talent, sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism. &#39;Ride With the Devil&#39; is among my five worst movie experiences ever, a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie was amusing at times, hell sometimes it was even downright funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The underlying message I got from the film though, was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man. Every time a woman is depicted in the film, she is being lazy, being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason. I don&#39;t think the message involved is good for women or gay men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it is a comedy, and a piece of art, so it is simply someones point of view. Even if I don&#39;t agree with it, they are still entitled to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An amusing film, but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid. Best film ever my foot.&#34;,
   &#39;This is definitely one of the weirder 70\&#39;s movies out there, and it\&#39;s most notable for kicking off a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie, especially when the dark, moody first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, who paddles around in a canoe for a while, then... leaves, never to be seen again). Although it\&#39;s painfully dated now, i\&#39;s still a fun scary movie to show to kids, and anyone who enjoys either Bigfoot lore or 70\&#39;s hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this. My favorite part: a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door (!?) and the narrator explains he went unconscious from &#34;shock.&#34; Uh, I\&#39;d say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious, but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m a big fan of the old westerns, and do not believe that Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy. fallen but virtuous woman, bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation, etc. I can\&#39;t help but notice the last names of the writer and young &#34;actor&#34; who plays Granger\&#39;s son. Any nepotism there? I\&#39;ve seen better acting in high school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Have I reached the 1000 words yet?&#39;,
   &#34;A pretty average scifi film. The plot was more or less obvious from the start. Although the acting was reasonably good, the writing seemed very cliched, using ideas taken from numerous films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic plot: Scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting. Onboard they find a stasis pod, which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment. After 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the pod waking up, you realise that he is a complete lunatic. Something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims, overall I think Speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter, which I didn&#39;t consider to be a good film either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good film, get Aliens out and watch that again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;A Damsel in Distress&#34; is definitely not one of Fred Astaire\&#39;s better musicals. But even Astaire\&#39;s bad films always had some good moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &#34;Damsel,&#34; Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family\&#39;s country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice\&#39;s romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry\&#39;s publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it\&#39;s time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include: \uf0b7 &#34;I\&#39;m Dancing and I Can\&#39;t Be Bothered Now&#34; -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great &#34;cane-twirling&#34; with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, &#34;Crazy For You,&#34; Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\uf0b7 &#34;Put Me To The Test&#34; -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\uf0b7 &#34;Stiff Upper Lip&#34; (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It\&#39;s the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\uf0b7 &#34;Things Are Looking Up&#34; -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it\&#39;s a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\uf0b7 &#34;A Foggy Day in London Town&#34; -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he\&#39;s not sure which way he\&#39;s going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\uf0b7 &#34;Nice Work If You Can Get It&#34; -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in &#34;Crazy For You.&#34;) \uf0b7 &#34;Drum Dance Number&#34; -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it\&#39;s a great dance number. But there\&#39;s absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that\&#39;s right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred\&#39;s clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The &gt;&gt;FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.&#39;,
   &#34;This is the biggest piece of crap ever. It looks like they spent more time, effort, and money making the DVD cover than they did on the actual movie. I really thought the DVD had been switched out with someone&#39;s homemade porno until I recognized one of the actors from the cover. This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats. The picture is really clear, but that, along with the very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, if that is actually what they are doing, and script, if they had one, makes this movie look worse than an old porno. At least the old porno has a point. This just looks like some PETA members got together and decided to make a really disturbing, pointless PSA about animals rights and feelings. This is so not worth the money or the time. It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims. The people who made this movie should be glad he&#39;s not still free, or he might have come after them just for screwing up this movie so bad.&#34;,
   &#34;Horror fans (I&#39;m speaking to the over 12&#39;s, although if you&#39;re under 12 I apologise for what you might deem an insult): In short, if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by well written, original storytelling, punctuated by unpredictable well planted scares, and delivered via convincing performances, then I can heartily recommend - AVOIDING THESE STEAMERS - made by directors who have apparently long since past their sell by date. It&#39;s no accident that almost every episode feels as if it were made in the 1980&#39;s. Not to put blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these old boys (or indeed the 80&#39;s) because where would we be without certain movies from the likes of Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (Actually Clive, WTF are you doing in there?! Glad to see Romero had the good sense to give it a miss as I&#39;m sure he was asked to partake...). More perhaps we should point the finger at creator Mick Garris whose credentials include the logic defying and depressingly ill-advised TV remake of Stanley Kubrick&#39;s masterpiece &#39;The Shining&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today. Are we so starved of good TV horror that we applaud any old sloppy schlock that the networks excrete onto our sets? Sadly, maybe so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I wouldn&#39;t see the point of adding a comment that doesn&#39;t argue the faults and merits of a production, I&#39;d just rate it accordingly. However, as this series is woefully lacking in any merit (with perhaps the sole exception of the theme tune) I write this as more of a warning than a review: DON&#39;T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. If you disagree with me then it&#39;s more than likely that you haven&#39;t seen enough decent horror. Perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors would be a much better place to start, but if these &#39;Masters&#39; of Horror were being assessed on these works alone, they&#39;d never have been allowed to graduate with even their Bachelor&#39;s degree. Unless of course they were studying for a degree from the University Of S**t.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Land of Plenty&#34; is not a film. It is a tombstone for the directorial career of German Director Wim Wenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many felt it in &#34;The Million Dollar Hotel&#34; and now &#34;Land of Plenty&#34; makes it perfectly clear; not only has Wenders lost it, he\&#39;s actually turned into a BAD director, creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might argue that the &#34;time you lose it&#34; comes for every director, but Wenders\&#39; case is extreme. It\&#39;s as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - only to get sloppish results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a few words, this film does not deserve your time.&#39;,
   &#39;National Treasure is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come. Nicholas Cage is in no way a believable action hero, and this film is no &#34;Indiana Jones&#34;. People who have compared this movie to the Indian Jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for. Maybe the pre-teen audience will like it, but I found it to be absolutely ludicrous. I also can\&#39;t imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film. Simply put: it\&#39;s just OK at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;National Treasure is unimagined and uninspired, borrowing what it does have from &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;. I would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006, and passing on this nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole idea of being able to so easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run around all over Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (while never damaging it once), while fighting the &#34;bad guys&#34; and experiencing what is supposed to be &#34;non-stop action&#34; is absurd. I particularly loved the scene with the Declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it. Oh brother! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminded me of that episode of the &#34;Brady Bunch&#34; where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Except, that episode of the Brady Bunch was much better than this whole film! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the US is outlandish. Literally, there are thousand of undiscovered &#34;priceless&#34; items in this treasure trove. Yeah right!! Ridiculous!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, the speed and accuracy of which Cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be &#34;tough&#34; clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterous!!! Oh.. the humanity! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances by Cage, Voight, and the other actors in &#34;National Treasure&#34; are as stiff ,wooden, and flat as they come. However, when you\&#39;re working with such lousy dialogue, it\&#39;s hard to fault the actor\&#39;s 100% for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;National Treasure is an OK film to see once. I can\&#39;t recommend it beyond that and would definitely NOT purchase this over the top, outlandish scavenger hunt of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rent it if you must see it first.......&#39;,
   &#34;If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, don&#39;t bother with Gawi. The film scarcely deserves mention alongside A-list work such as Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure, and Ju-On (or even such good material as The Eye or Inner Senses). Those films brim with subtleties, unexpected imagery, rich characters, and a decidedly non-Western take on what&#39;s frightening. Gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made American horror lousy for the past twenty-five years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film tries to blend Asian ghost story and Hollywood slasher flick, but it&#39;s a bad fit. One aesthetic is bound to smother the other; guess which? Having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot Ringu for an evil-child subplot, but the situation is hopeless. Clichés, crap characters, witless plotting, a dull ghost, ho hum.&#34;,
   &#39;In a far away Galaxy is a planet called Ceta. It\&#39;s native people worship cats. But the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people up for food. This is one of the stupidest f#@k!ng ideas for a movie I\&#39;ve seen. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films. It\&#39;s like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of Limbo. How low can he go? The only losers in the scenario are US the viewer. Mr. Mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who STILL buy this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: F &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DVD Extras: Commentary by Ted Mikels; the Story behind the Making of (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds of Behind the scenes footage; Ted Mikels filmography; and Trailers for &#34;The Worm Eaters&#34; &#34;Girl in Gold Boots&#34;, &#34;the Doll Squad&#34;, &#34;Ten Violent Women&#34; (featuring nudity), &#34;Blood Orgy of the She Devils&#34;, &amp; &#34;the Corpse Grinders&#34;&#39;,
   &#39;Let\&#39;s face it-- if you rented a STDVD sequel of a forgotten 80\&#39;s gem, and expected it to be better than the aforementioned, then you are an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily. Movies like this don\&#39;t need spoilers, because YOU already know them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;plot&#34; for this &#34;film&#34;, is as follows: Nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with Top Secret Government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by Government suits in the other country; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the &#34;film&#34;; nerd and girl are captured; the Top Secret Government computer gets crazy; nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats Top Secret Computer by using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames &#34;film&#34;; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting, script, effects, score, and cinematography are what you would expect-- B-grade. Some familiar faces are in here, and unless you are a mega fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid this one. Granted, the movie won\&#39;t make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap looking STDVD sequels, then you are right at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, Mathew Broderick was too involved with some &#34;masterpiece&#34;, that he couldn\&#39;t even do a five second cameo in this one. But can you blame him?&#39;,
   &#34;Big Bad Ralph is also on the not so squeazy truck commercials, and can be found at numerous brothels around Melbourne any given night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible Film by the way, wasn&#39;t shocking just bad, uninteresting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main guy was in charge of the metal section on countdown , and was the lead bouncer at a gay night club in Melbourne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dunno who the women where? probably pros&#39;s that Ralph knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No story of interest, its one of those fast forward jobs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please look up Big Bad Ralph at brothels around Melbourne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hes famous in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish i could give 0/10 but ill give it 1. Only cos i cant give 0&#34;,
   &#34;The secret is...this movie blows. Sorry, but it just did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****SPOILER****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this bad riff on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM, Beth, played admirably by Dorie Barton, joins several friends on a Spring Break trip. The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. Then, the deaths begin. First one then another then another of the friends is murdered, leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, Dorie Barton is the poor man&#39;s Reese Witherspoon\x96she looks like Reese, acts like Reese and could pass for Reese in a police lineup. Maybe that&#39;s how they cast her? Anyhoo, decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing.&#34;,
   &#39;Strictly a routine, by-the-numbers western (directed by genre-mainstay Andrew V. McLaglen, so is that any wonder?). Army colonel Brian Keith spars with smarmy bandit Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped the colonel\&#39;s wife (Honor Blackman, who never found her niche after playing Pussy Galore in &#34;Goldfinger&#34;). Fist-fights, shoot-outs, stagecoach robberies and Denver Pyle in a supporting role...in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Talking in a low monotone throughout, Keith gets to dally with a prostitute (something of a shock after his run on TV\&#39;s &#34;Family Affair&#34;), but otherwise this low-rent material wastes Keith\&#39;s amiable talents. It\&#39;s also bad news for Dino, who doesn\&#39;t seem to notice or care. Hack direction, poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor. * from ****&#39;,
   &#39;(Very light spoilers, maybe.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch this tonight. I had to switch it off before the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both came across as self-absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter also adding in rude, disrespectful and reckless to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, &#34;At least we won\&#39;t have to watch her anymore.&#34; Keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving, but it was too far gone for me by then. I simply wasn\&#39;t enjoying it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to care for the protagonist, you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner--if it\&#39;s nearly an hour in and I don\&#39;t care, it\&#39;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast was sincere and well played--I felt for *them!*--and the gay best friend was wonderful, but even combined, that wasn\&#39;t enough to carry the film for me.&#39;,
   &#39;Sorry this movie did not scare me it just annoyed me. It was just so frustrating when I saw the potential and that, all that, fell by the wayside. The children! The father! The premonition! Had so much potential and ziltch! zero, nada! I have heard it all before. Scary! No! I can scare myself alone, here where I sit, than they could in the movie. Are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying? Huh? This movie was quite atmospheric. Or at least it could have been, had the director/writer bothered to work it. We could have had some good music that would have added to the tension too, if someone had made the effort. What I really want to know is why do they get the money? Just give it to me and save all that hassle. Abandoned?... No we where betrayed&#39;,
   &#39;In fact, it never was. I\&#39;m not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy. What a vacuous shambles! None of these people come close to a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc, and anyway, today\&#39;s audience isn\&#39;t as receptive to this facile muck. Writing is trivial. The hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious. The chemistry between the leading characters is non-existent. It\&#39;s interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she\&#39;s a reincarnation of some big star from the &#34;golden age of Hollywood&#34;, whenever that may be. It\&#39;s an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.&#39;,
   &#39;Much of &#34;Over Her Dead Body&#34; is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva Longoria proves that she can\&#39;t carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy, and further, that she doesn\&#39;t really even have any comedic timing. She\&#39;s grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé. The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd, drippy and charmless, while the psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has. I felt most sorry for Bell, as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work. Unfortunately, she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable, and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of &#34;Titanic.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Over Her Dead Body&#34; actually pi**ed me off, because of its laziness and utter lack of effort. I started to think of all the interesting projects that can\&#39;t get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this. Seriously, does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How stupid do they really think the movie-going public is? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: F&#39;,
   &#39;I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest: &#34; I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo &#34; and &#34; I\&#39;ll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle\&#39;s head in my bed &#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 ) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year\&#39;s award ceremony wasn\&#39;t too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasn\&#39;t the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better )but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) I\&#39;m sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Rock wasn\&#39;t too bad , but he\&#39;s no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the &#34; minor &#34; Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There\&#39;s no such thing as a &#34; minor &#34; Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they\&#39;re as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn\&#39;t for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of America\&#39;s greatest living character actors &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he\&#39;d never won one . Actually I\&#39;m glad about this because if he didn\&#39;t deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didn\&#39;t deserve it for THE AVIATOR &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB\&#39;s controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven\&#39;t done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd\&#39;s sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts&#39;,
   &#34;Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field? Well this happens about 25 times in this movie(clearly the directors&#39; favorite scare tactic). In one of the opening scenes the smooth talking/hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film. Shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and, although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute. After about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown&#39;s history in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie check out the ladies chest.. her ribs go all the way to her neck, it was flat out disgusting. Most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors backyard. The movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely RENT THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN SNUCK UP ON IN AN OPEN FIELD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIGNED, THE ANSWER&#34;,
   &#34;Upon viewing Tobe Hooper&#39;s gem, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre. I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we&#39;d need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Tobe Hooper&#39;s crocky opus referenced his own movies, Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/rip-offs to Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones&#39; Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000, and any James Bond movie. Also, try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed the crock didn&#39;t get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism...or crocky appreciation, but the quasi-Captain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach. Perhaps, in the coming years, we&#39;ll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset. Or hopefully, a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-G monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me.&#34;,
   &#39;There\&#39;s a lot of movies that have set release dates, only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind, and then put in limbo for a long time. You can only wish a film as rotten as &#34;Slackers&#34; remained in a coma for what it\&#39;s worth, which is miniscule. Release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves. The premise kicks off under the guise of Ethan, a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell Angela. Ethan devilishly enlists the aid of David and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win Angela. I don\&#39;t like to give spoilers out, but for a piece of crap like this I can make an exception. Angela falls for David, Ethan intentionally screws everything up, the good guys win. That\&#39;s what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre. Gross humor is funny, it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic &#34;Animal House&#34;, to the likes of contemporaries like &#34;There\&#39;s Something About Mary&#34; and &#34;Road Trip&#34; amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention. But when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far, case in point, Ethan has an Angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it. No one wants to take witness to watch Ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself. No one wants to watch a young man singing &#34;She\&#39;ll be coming around the mountain&#34; with a sock on his penis. But nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50\&#39;s bombshell Mamie Van Doren bare her breasts at 71 years old. I don\&#39;t know if it\&#39;s the story\&#39;s lack of coherence, which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense. Director Dewey Nicks was a former fashion photographer, and after reviewing this film, you can only wish he\&#39;ll go back to the profession. The worst thing you can do on any film, is to make it look like you\&#39;re having fun, because you detract from your objectives, just like &#34;Slackers&#34; does, by burying it\&#39;s plot outline under a pile of gross out gags, pointless vignettes, and lack of construction. It\&#39;s like a bunch of college students got drunk, took one\&#39;s camcorder, and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together. If you want to see a teen gross out comedy that\&#39;s actually good, then I suggest &#34;American Pie&#34; and &#34;Animal House&#34;, or &#34;Road Trip&#34;, just something that\&#39;s entertaining, and not dreadfully bad like &#34;Slackers&#34;. Coincidentally Cameron Diaz makes a cameo in this film, just as she did in another bad film such as &#34;The Sweetest Thing&#34; where the story treats gross humor like another plot, instead of a device much like this disaster.. If you pass by &#34;Slackers&#34; at your local video store, just keep on walking, and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves.&#39;,
   &#34;This film is shoddily-made, unoriginal garbage. I like romantic comedies sometimes. Watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner. It&#39;s not something you are going to do all the time, but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being. This movie made me think about how stupid I was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time. Everything about it screamed made on the cheap. It actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out. It boasts cheesy CGI and lame sets, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing was clunky. I know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy, but you usually don&#39;t really care because you are laughing. This movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved. Events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition. Sure, this is how all movies work, but you shouldn&#39;t notice that it&#39;s happening. Inelegant. That&#39;s the term I should use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was almost no one in the movie who was really likable. I didn&#39;t care who ended up with whom, as long as they all stayed the hell away from me, and I didn&#39;t have to listen to them talk about it anymore. Why would the only really cool character in the movie, the Paul Rudd character, want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy, condescending, control freak played by Eva Longoria? Also, almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation. A straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out (and bathe with) with a woman he is attracted to? The best feel-good moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with Rudd&#39;s equally annoying lying, kleptomaniac sister? Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, appealing women. Maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road.&#34;,
   &#34;First, let&#39;s get it out of the way. . . yeah, this film steals a LOT from &#39;Darkness Falls&#39; (2003). The plot for &#39;Darkness Falls&#39; goes something like this: The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge. In &#39;The Tooth Fairy&#39; (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (who, yeah, hides her face) unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone. A little too similar to be coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, what must be asked is this: If you&#39;re going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie, why choose something as mediocre as &#39;Darkness Falls&#39;? Sure it made a few bucks at the box office, but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered. A low-budget, straight-to-video movie will not have that same effect. And it didn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I watched the opening 15-20 minutes of the film, my expectations actually rose. There seemed to be at least SOME production value. The story didn&#39;t seem terrible, just blatantly ripped off. Past the first scene, we get an okay cast of characters including an ex-doctor with secrets (played by that guy who looks like a Busey) and some hot veterinary student (Jenifer from Argento&#39;s &#39;Masters of Horror: Jenifer&#39;). After those few minutes, however, the film just slowly goes down the drain. It serves all the basic horrible clichés including, but not limited to: some crazy old person with an unheeded warning, the buff dumb jock, the psychic, and the stripper with the heart-of-gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience. It&#39;s kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time. When the adults were on screen, it had a more mature feel. When Star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the jock) were on screen, the dialogue went down to a more stupid, err immature, level. When the kid was on screen, it felt like an episode of &#39;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&#39;. . . only less scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically, the film is all over the place. The visuals range from fairly good to plain boring. The writing is subpar, as is the acting for the most part. On the plus side, there&#39;s some excessive gore at parts (including a fairly cool (yet painfully predictable)) woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene. Also, if you&#39;re looking for a bit of the sexy stuff, there&#39;s a brief topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better films to do that). Other than that, there&#39;s not much to bother with when it comes to this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re a huge fan of &#39;Darkness Falls&#39; (do those exist?), maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way. . . but, that&#39;s about the only reason I can find to see this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict: 3/10 -AP3-&#34;,
   &#39;With a title like that, it\&#39;s above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did NOT appeal to me. Granted, there\&#39;s a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse &#34;shock&#34; tactics... The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a &#34;grabby&#34; neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... Surely, &#34;I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave&#34; was intended as an unofficial sequel to &#34;I Spit on Your Grave&#34; - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion! This movie is a boring, amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably...&#39;,
   &#34;Richard Pryor&#39;s early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow. In his stand up,he jokes about it getting great laughs. It seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose. The Toy is about the lamest he ever chose,aside from I guess Another You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? Nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing. It&#39;s seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end. I wanted to see Pryor get even with this brat,instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his &#39;70s stuff. This is a waste of any movie watcher&#39;s time!&#34;,
   &#34;Saw it yesterday night at the Midnight Slam of the Festival des films du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly over rated by IMDb fans. The acting was only but regular. The directing didn&#39;t bring anything new or interesting. The plot lacks considerably : the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls(7eventy 5ive). And on top of that, you can predict the movie&#39;s end in the first five minutes. If you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie, you might like it. If you don&#39;t, this movie is not worth it.&#34;,
   &#34;I was really disappointed with this film. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I watched Polyester and really sort of hated it. The only thing I liked about that movie was DIVINE. She/He had a hell of a lot of talent. I was truly surprised. As a whole, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this film...&#34;,
   &#39;I was so disappointed by this show. After hearing and reading all the hoopla about it, how it was a &#34;ground breaking show&#34; and all sorts of wild promises if quality, I tried to watch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a letdown!! The acting was way forced and exaggerated. The story made very little sense. As for any hint of the vaunted &#34;look into teenagers\&#39; lives&#34;, I could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it\&#39;s really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is.&#39;,
   &#34;People love the original story for its ending. The Hollywood style ending made this 99 version of &#39;A Dog of Flanders&#39; just for kids movie. I didn&#39;t cry this time because the story was too Hollywood. Japanese TV series are much better.&#34;,
   &#34;Even though there&#39;s a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this &#39;Succubus&#39; is often named as THE best Jess Franco film. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts &#39;Succubus&#39; among his personal favorites. So, maybe it&#39;s me but I thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie. The opening is great, though, and shows Janine Reynaud performing an SM act on stage. It&#39;s all downhill from here, unfortunately. Reynaud&#39;s character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance. Franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations, beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score. This COULD have been his greatest film indeed, if it wasn&#39;t for the lame and uninteresting story. It&#39;s supposed to be psychedelic but I&#39;d say sophomoric is a better term to describe what&#39;s shown here. Half of the time, you don&#39;t have a clue what&#39;s going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages. This most certainly isn&#39;t Franco&#39;s best film according to me. I wouldn&#39;t even recommend it to die-hard exploitation fans. If you&#39;re looking for more superior Jess Franco film, try to get your hands on &#39;Las Vampiras&#39;, &#39;The awful Dr. Orloff&#39; or &#39;Female Vampire&#39;.&#34;,
   &#39;Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. In many of films, such &#34;Do The Right Thing,&#34; most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism once again being the entire issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Lee does, however, is once again demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity. It\&#39;s amazing the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified, but Christians? Hey, it\&#39;s &#34;open season&#34; on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible. They zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it. Hey, folks, here\&#39;s another Bible reader and look what he\&#39;\&#39;s like! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing? However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness toward white people doesn\&#39;t help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, Spike: start &#34;doing the right thing&#34; and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, &#34;get over it.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought- provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.&#39;,
   &#34;I am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original -- have not seen, and doubt I will. It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (Jimmy Fallon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. He&#39;s supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot. Not Fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells Fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she&#39;s moving on. And rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago. But of course the plot mechanics won&#39;t allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. Its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.&#34;,
   &#34;A terrible movie containing a bevy of D-list Canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is badly written, badly edited, and badly directed. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with. It&#39;s not even camp enough to be funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#39;t the director see that the &#39;creature&#39; looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske&#39;s orange wisps of &#39;magic&#39; (!?! for lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, with no choreographer, overlaid with completely derivative special effects. Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film (not the good kind)? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn from the mistakes of others ... don&#39;t even waste your time with this one, you&#39;ll regret it like I did. I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid.&#34;,
   &#34;I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many that just didn&#39;t work. I didn&#39;t like the idea of bringing in Sherlock Holmes&#39; and Moriarty&#39;s descendants. It was confusing. It would have been more funny if they just had someone new, instead of Moriarty resurrected. Some of the things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. The McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett-like. Connie Booth obviously is very good with accents. She is from Indiana, but played English and a New Yorker pretty well. Unfortunately, she was not presented much into the script. I was expecting a more funny film. Instead, I got a rather confusing movie with a poor script. Rather ironic, since both Booth and Cleese were together on this one. Maybe they were about to break up in 77.&#34;,
   &#39;The only redemption was the small part by Larry Miller. It seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be &#34;Something About Mary,&#34; but I didn\&#39;t even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of her Cruel Intentions character. James Brolin was great, but Paul\&#39;s father seemed like he was trying too hard to be the Randy Quaid character from the National Lampoon\&#39;s Vacation movies.&#39;,
   &#39;This film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be forewarned that &#34;Art Heist&#34; doesn\&#39;t add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no clue what to do with the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Baldwin keeps reappearing in films, and frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent, or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks, complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies. The only good movie in which he has appeared, is &#34;The Squid and the Whale&#34;, in which he only speaks two, or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, doesn\&#39;t fare much better; there is no chemistry between Ms. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A movie to be seen at the viewer\&#39;s own risk.&#39;,
   &#39;This is the worst, and I mean THE worst computers based movie I have ever seen. The whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person. Now you probably think this must be some super cool high-tech computer, well , it is, but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic interface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the main idea how to overload the &#34;super&#34; computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid. My mobile phone will shut the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this genius computer cant decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are also some other bad things about it but I just don\&#39;t have time for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just cant believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this&#39;,
   &#34;i saw switching goals ..twice....and always the same feeling...you see the Olsen twins make same movie....they like play different sports and then fall in love to boys..OK now about the movie....first off all such little boys and girls don&#39;t play on such big goals...2.football does not play on time outs...3.if the game is at its end the referee gives some overtime (a minute or more)...and the finish is so foreseen....i think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football knowledgement....if it were done by European producers it would be better..and also the mane actors aren&#39;t the wright choice...they suffer from lack of authentic..OK they played some seasons in full house but that doesn&#39;t make them big stars....you have got to show your talent....and that is what is missing in the Olsen twins&#34;,
   &#39;This is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads. After all, Feierstein\&#39;s Flex Crush will have you know that Real Men don\&#39;t watch anything by Truffaut. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might have been interesting if Truffaut had anything to -say- here. The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Sica\&#39;s &#34;Bicycle Thief&#34;? Or anything by Hitchcock?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as Truffaut, who spends all his free time \&#39;screwing up his eyes\&#39; at the movies, who wrecks schoolroom discipline, gets accused of plagiarism(the many petty thefts), and ultimately escapes societal confines to make \&#39;his own movie\&#39;. Sorry...been there, done that too many times for this to matter.&#39;,
   &#39;This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I\&#39;ve seen in a long time. Sadly I was duped into sticking with it, since Donald Sutherland\&#39;s presence misleadingly gave it some credibility. [That\&#39;s the last time that\&#39;ll happen.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesley Ann Warren\&#39;s character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come. There were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film. Thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask, &#34;Where is the justice?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is late-night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered. This film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process. All it ends up doing is turning the viewer\&#39;s stomach with its sickness, and insulting the viewer\&#39;s intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is misleadingly good. My guess is that they BAGGED Sutherland first, and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m kicking myself for wasting time, giving this piece of garbage a chance.&#39;,
   &#34;Attack Force has a horrendous title, and can almost certainly be judged by it&#39;s awful cover, because the film is horrible! A mish-mash of plot lines, a choppy mess, and a horribly stagnated pace, make the film hard to watch start to finish. I managed this and I&#39;m proud. As a fan of Seagal&#39;s work (mostly of his old days), it&#39;s painful to see him star in such tripe. True Seagal&#39;s last half dozen movies or so, have sucked a lot, but some of them at least had some redeeming features. Attack Force is a mess. From conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes, from an alien plot line, to the current one about a highly addictive super drug, about to be unleashed on the Romanian (the film has several settings, none of which are Romanian, but all look like Romania because they are in Romania!) populace. The film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was. Plot-holes and loose ends are abound in the film that&#39;s for sure. That&#39;s been a problem in Seagal&#39;s last few films as well, but never has the result been so boring. There&#39;s a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with CTX (that&#39;s the drugs cool name) that is never resolved! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course in recent years the plot&#39;s haven&#39;t been the main draw in the Seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments, especially the action. Before I regard the action though, all the other departments are poor. The direction is poor, or perhaps better put, made to look poor. Who knows how director Michael Keusch originally intended this film? Between him finishing his job, the re-shoots by stunt man Tom Delmar, and the editing, a coherent auteur vision is completely lost. The best way to describe the film is that it&#39;s just all over the shop! The cinematography is dull, nearly inducing sleep, while the droning score (sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers) does nothing to excite matters. The cast too are poor, unable to salvage anything here. Seagal looks bored beyond recognition, and is dubbed through much of the picture, clearly when plot-points are being changed. He looks tired and overweight, and lethargic, unlike he&#39;s looked in previous pictures too (remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in Seagal&#39;s recent pictures). The only redeemable cast member is Adam Croasdell as one of the villains, doing a slimy Brit routine. He seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line, because he&#39;s playing it inhuman. He seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire (ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion, seemingly waiting for her husband\x85 Dracula).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the action. Well it&#39;s poor. Poorly conceived, poorly shot. There&#39;s not much either, and there&#39;s even less featuring Seagal. Stevo doesn&#39;t really bring out the stunt double here, because there&#39;s so little to do. There&#39;s even a lengthy (repetitive and boring) action scene on the hour mark that inter-cuts occasionally with little flashes of Seagal&#39;s stand in because clearly Seagal wasn&#39;t there while the scene was being shot, and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene. Seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head. Seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit, but from what I understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it&#39;s in. Seagal will apparently not be working with these people again, or with Castel Studio&#39;s who continue to deliver horrifically sub-Nu-Image (that&#39;s saying something), material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is one to avoid if you are not a Seagal fan. Seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably won&#39;t want to do anything this bad again. Unfortunately his next film which has already been shot, with the same people, promises to be even worse than this. *&#34;,
   &#34;The five or so really good westerns that Mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in Hollywood. Even John Ford never made that many with so much quality. The curious thing about them all is how uneven they are. Ford&#39;s My Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real hero of them besides Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase being responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote far country, bend of the river, and probably some others. But none of them are as finished as My Darling Clementine, but then very few films, western or otherwise are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the five films of Mann have huge gaps, or is it six, lets see. Bend, Far, Man of the West, Furies, Winchester 73, and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene, with fairly glaring lapses. Yet so does Red River, which is still the single greatest western ever made. So perfection isn&#39;t everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But The Far Country has huge, huge holes. It&#39;s mawkish, and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are locking horns. The rest is pretty pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann&#39;s camera. Mann&#39;s camera is a one man course in cinematography. It is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film. It is almost never in the wrong place, never. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Far Country has one amazing moment. And as usual it comes from Stewart. Nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man. He is absolutely amazing: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester, and Man from Laramie: in Bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from Dachau, in Far he is shot off a raft with such violence, it looks so convincing that you wince, and of course when he is dragged through the fire in Man, well you find yourself looking for the burn marks. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room, also as well as anybody ever did it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was Mann&#39;s territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. Cooper while not being quite as convincing as Stewart, nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as Mann. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great, great director. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See every western he ever made. They are his real monuments, even if all are scetchy. But so what. When he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody, including Ford. And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Anthony.&#34;,
   &#39;It was 1 a.m. in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Don\&#39;t judge me... please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We\&#39;re back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group have made their way onto an island. It doesn\&#39;t take too long before they encounter a large &#34;reptile&#34;, which gobbles up their horse. Soon they\&#39;re captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the &#34;reptile gods.&#34; THE CG sucks; it reminds me of the CG of early console video games. The encounters were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit. Otherwise it\&#39;s just a middling effort.&#39;,
   &#39;The title above is used to introduce the film &#34;Gen&#34; to its audience. Gen is about a young doctor(Doga Rutkay) with an ill mother. The film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While she drives, we realise that she is not that close home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital, she sees the death body of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two policemen comes to the hospital so as to investigate the suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with outside world is cut off too. There is no way out!! In those few days, there will be more nasty murders. Now everybody suspects from each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are positive sides of the movie of course. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially, when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. Actings are okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary though. I think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie. What I am saying is, it was a good twist but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realised that was coming when we see what is happening. The director needed to explain it altogether which I think didn\&#39;t work well. Also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Lastly, I would like to say a few things about the director. I am sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I have recently found out that he is only 21 years old. That made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I am not going to rate this film * out of ***** though.&#39;,
   &#39;This move is about as bad as they come. I was, however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery. There are many great shots of the southwest including many in Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the US. It is also, starting with John Ford, one of the most filmed. In fact one scene with Kris and the girl was filmed on a place called John Ford point.&#39;,
   &#39;i should qualify that title, now that i think about it. Checkout is not entirely worthless. i\&#39;ve had the opportunity to see it twice, and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie\&#39;s expense. so i guess it\&#39;s worth something for that. and also it\&#39;s worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing. as another reviewer pointed out, this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word. not a single original thought went into this movie (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me). the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie. it is definitely not the next Clerks, it is definitely not original, and it is absolutely not &#34;good, clean fun.&#34; the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated (after seeing it a first time, the second time can be quite funny, in an insulting sort of way). as i looked around the theater, it was obvious that nearly everyone, barring perhaps the elderly, were completely bored or pained by this movie. during some of the particularly emotional scenes, like where Nick chews out his mother, the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done. i even heard someone *groan* in the theater, something i had heretofore never witnessed. i don\&#39;t care where you have the chance to see this movie, be it at a film festival, or in a indie theater, or wherever. do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you\&#39;re like me and just can\&#39;t resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made.&#39;,
   &#34;and not in a fun-to-watch way. it&#39;s just bad. it&#39;s shocking that people have posted positive things about it here. the story sucks, the acting is bad, it&#39;s not scary, the special effects aren&#39;t special--oh no! the blackboard has hands coming out of it! oh gee--the mirror turned into water! the hair, clothes and makeup in the &#39;50s scenes aren&#39;t accurate, and they got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play the high-school version of himself. this is like later-on nightmare on elm street stuff. i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else, but there are better bad ones out there to choose from.&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this film a while ago on a Video CD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will 1st mention the good points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie, at first, at least tries to appear that it is not biased, like not showing one character as black and the other as white. Both main characters are friends and co-exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing. Their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport, Sport Rifle shooting, as comrades not as competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, after the 1st 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other. That for some unknown reason Bosnia is now on a path to conflict. Sure, the script adds in TV footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in English, but the clips are from 1993 not 1992 when the war began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The history, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The movie tries to place the blame with Karadzic, who had been a Presidential candidate and leader of the Bosnian Parliament\&#39;s 2nd Largest Party(SDP). According to the Constitution of Bosnia, the SDP was to have the Presidency in 1992, but there was a Coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in March in which it declared itself the law in Bosnia and announced Secession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The history of the IDAP begins with Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from &#34;STtH&#34;. He was a student of Nazism in WW2. He even wrote his own &#34;Mein Kampf&#34; in which he stated: &#34;It is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between \&#39;the Islamic Religion\&#39; and non-Islamic social and political institutions&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1990 he lost the IDAP elections to &#34;pro-Yugoslavia Moderate&#34; Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim, that worked with Christian Serbs during the Civil War, and who treated his supporters like brothers. Abdic was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the elections but seized the seat of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The events from above are missing from the movie, but they are the factual events that lead to the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were problems with props too. Serb soldiers in the movie were wearing Soviet WW2 helmets, which they did not use. Also the one soldier was holding an M-1944 WW2 rifle only used by USSR not Yugoslavia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Director and Script Writers had a chance, but they chose to re-write history.&#39;,
   &#34;Sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give this is that it maintains that old tradition. These three tales aren&#39;t anything as good as any from the original Creepshow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners. The second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop, makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it. The third story includes a cameo from Stephen King as a truck driver, but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the original Creepshow instead, or if you already have done then be happy with that.&#34;,
   &#34;Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was obviously received in different ways: Some were appalled, some were shocked others applauded the courage. I however am completely untouched, bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent, inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was this movie actually about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I&#39;ve seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream (in the nude) of beasts. Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent, the girl having sex with the black butler (is he also characterized as a beast?) has a very grown up attitude to sexuality, so where is the consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire towards two young boys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it about bestiality? The metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality, especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the topic? I don&#39;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I don&#39;t know. I only know that showing a fired gun doesn&#39;t make a film a war movie. Dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So look across the controversy. Don&#39;t be scared by the bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and stuff. I am not. Look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made, poorly edited, poorly acted, really poorly written (okay, some pictures are quite nice, and the main character is a really good looking girl) cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent. It doesn&#39;t. It makes it boring.&#34;,
   &#34;My life is about saving animals. I do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I couldn&#39;t kill an animal even to sustain my life. I can&#39;t even kill a spider, I put it outdoors. The scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies, with Sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and has haunted me ever since. It simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance. The ending - the foster parents adopt Sooner - does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty. Why would anyone want their child to see this film?&#34;,
   &#34;It&#39;s been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad.. The acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and I&#39;m at a loss for words as to the execution. It was completely unoriginal. O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood&#39;s a pregnant Schwarzenegger! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let&#39;s face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might never happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who&#39;s an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it&#39;s a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.&#34;,
   &#34;Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I felt that the film wasn&#39;t the best I had seen. At the end of the movie I was left feeling like there was something missing in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bette Davis did a perfect job, though, and she made me hate her and pity her all the while. Leslie Howard did very good as the lovelorn Philip Carey, and I so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame. It&#39;s such a sad thing when one finds him/herself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it&#39;s someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, though pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the acting was what came through and not the plot. The ending scene was particularly good, but I am not one to give it away. Although others may find this movie good, I was one who found it so-so. I should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person.&#34;,
   &#34;99.999% pure crap. And the other .001% was a brief moment where I thought the blond chick was going to disrobe. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue was legendarily bad. The action sucked, and there was no sex (the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed, alas, the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I&#39;ve ever seen on film, and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring. Acting was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only &#39;names&#39; in this movie. And Marina Sirtis looked really, really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve seen high school plays more capably produced. This is the kind of movie that MST3K thrived on. Heads should roll at Sci-Fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air.&#34;,
   &#34;Yes there are great performances here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that doesn&#39;t seem to have a clue what it&#39;s doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour in, the characters who, until this point, had always spoken to each other, suddenly start singing to each other. To further confuse things, a little further in, out of nowhere, they actually do about 15 minutes of sung-through dialog, then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things, such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section. On top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used, is the composers&#39; clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed. While the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound, the rest of the film is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there&#39;s the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder I couldn&#39;t help laughing out loud. This was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth and resent that I wasted two hours of it watching this film.&#34;,
   &#34;Well, finally got to see the remake last night in London, unintentionally hilarious, sexless and devoid of any real humour. I don&#39;t really know where to start, whilst I was entertained by this strange homage, it didn&#39;t really move me. The acting is screamingly hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are far too &#39;Disney&#39; there is a ridiculous &#39;six months later&#39; insert after the burning of Nic Cage (which didn&#39;t come soon enough for my liking) The bit with Cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various &#39;baddies&#39; on the island. It&#39;s such a weird remake that I cant quite believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip presents would have done in the eighties, a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the Miner&#39;s Strike, very strange!&#34;,
   &#39;To sat how awful The Shield is, you\&#39;d have to write pages and pages, so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;When Directors Go Awry&#34; should have been the title of this production. Indeed, directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling that propels the story forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a &#34;style&#34;? How is it propelling the story forward? Of course there\&#39;s also the &#34;editing by random numbers&#34; nonsense. Apparently it\&#39;s become hip to just cut randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it\&#39;s too much work to do good editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that made it too much work for most people to watch The Shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched shows of all time.&#39;,
   &#34;It&#39;s about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old Indian traditions. At times it is clear how most of the &#39;doctors&#39; are charlatans, even lying about how they don&#39;t charge their clients. While they are wearing their gold watches, the &#39;donation&#39; box is mandatory. Notice that there are only a couple of people who get &#39;cured&#39; while we see quite a few cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest Indian bank note is 5 rupee, while the average salary in India is 1,700 ru/month.&#34;,
   &#34;Saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970&#39;s and hated, hated, hated it! Easily the most booooring movie I have ever seen in my life. Don&#39;t know where Leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie, just long, long silences with people unable to articulate what they are (presumably) feeling. If you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this! Yes, Leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss.&#34;,
   &#39;I have no idea why they made this version of &#34;Persuasion&#34; when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose that they wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; alas, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the lovely wit and humour, leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool). That is something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this level-headed heroine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have said they found this antic laughable; my reaction was not laughter, but outrage. The very idea of such a corruption of an Austen work is beneath contempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was ghastly.&#39;,
   &#34;If you hit your teens in the 70s, as I did, you probably remember the stories about Studio 54 whether or not you liked disco. An exclusive club, it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self-absorption; there&#39;s even an excellent VH1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday, and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this isn&#39;t it. 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees, a bartender named Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a busboy named Greg (Breckin Meyer), his wife, a coat-check girl, Anita (Selma Hayek), and of course the master of ceremonies himself, Steve Rubell (Mike Meyers). While the goings-on at the club are well represented, this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers, following Shane&#39;s story the closest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie works in spurts. Sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture (such as when Shane is taken to a dinner party and doesn&#39;t know who &#39;Errol Flynt&#39; is), and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama. Some of that is inherent in the premise \x96 following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous \x96 but a lot of it is due to the kid-gloved treatment with which both the club and Rubell are given throughout the movie. While Rubell certainly electrified the scene in New York with his penchant for over-the-top spectacle and his exclusive hand-picking of the crowds each night, the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on; and Rubell himself, while his excesses are mentioned, come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar, a cheat, a drug abuser, and promiscuous as all hell. Not that I was looking for the man to be pilloried here, but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate. A final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meyers does his best to capture Rubell, but he&#39;s given so little to work with here it&#39;s surprising his performance is effective; but he&#39;s good, and he helps to anchor the film. Philippe, whom I find generally to be a good actor, is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character; he&#39;s limited to a deer-in-the-headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown, and even he can&#39;t translate that into a strong performance. Hayek and Meyer are both okay, again, undercut by the writing, and Neve Campbell \x96 prominently featured on the DVD cover \x96 appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I still find myself interested, even fascinated, by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies. But even given that, this is not a film that particularly engaged me, despite a predisposition to like it. I&#39;d say if that era, or that club, has any interest for you, track down the VH1 special rather than this middle-of-the-road melodrama.&#34;,
   &#39;I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently. The sci fi channel has run worse, but not by much. A shameless ripoff of Jurassic Park, ATTACK substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are on the loose, devouring as many extras as possible. The CGI is pretty bad, and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable. We get some gore, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it. Other than Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently this was shot in Fiji. Nice work if you can get it. Reminds me of all those low-budget monster STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.&#39;,
   &#34;Sundown - featuring the weakest, dorkiest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unfitting, pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, who&#39;s every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vampires don&#39;t seem to have any special powers at all - except for strength (sometimes), being able to switch off a lamp with their mind (one time) and... that&#39;s it, really. Ever imagine count Dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight &#39;cause he ran out of bullets? Neither did I. Practically any other movie-Dracula would eat this one for breakfast, skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight - Dracula&#39;s vs. some old geezer&#39;s. It could have been some good old B-flick fun, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously, and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats, mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it&#39;s just too silly to be funny. Sure, it has some amusing moments, but they&#39;re few, and far apart.&#34;,
   &#34;SCARECROWS seems to be a botched horror meets supernatural film. A group of thugs pull off a paramilitary-like robbery of the payroll at Camp Pendleton in California. They high-jack a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demands to be flown to Mexico. Along the way one greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a cornfield monitored by strange looking scarecrows. These aren&#39;t just any run-of-the-mill scarecrows...they can kill. The acting is no better than the horrible dialog. And the attempts at humor are not funny. Very low budget and shot entirely in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.&#34;,
   &#34;Don&#39;t spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography.When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves a lot to be said. I was expecting something better from award winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as Maldeamores. A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example) but it should not permeate the plot. The movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film.&#34;,
   &#39;After seeing the credits with only one name that I recognize and that was the preacher in this film (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this film and I was not disappointed. A man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life. Unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses, in contrast, a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull. A simple plot with a twist of irony at the end. If you are tired late one night and in need of sleep, this will help you to sleep that sleep.&#39;,
   &#39;Opening scene \&#39;explains\&#39; why Hurt is later \&#39;immune\&#39; to the \&#39;Contaminated Man\&#39;. Too bad it doesn\&#39;t explain anything else: How did he get whatever he \&#39;caught\&#39;/what was it/why does it work so fast. Then we go to &#34;Present Day Budapest&#34;. OK, was the opener in the past or the future? It turns out to be the past, of course, but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid closer attention, huh? Or maybe it\&#39;s just badly done. Then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he\&#39;s had in related fields, and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him. Aha! So the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects? He must have been one of the top guys, he\&#39;s friends with the c e o of the Chemical company, for God sakes. Then there\&#39;s the substance itself: Technically a poison, but it mutates in immune \&#39;carriers\&#39;, so we can have whatever we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it\&#39;s not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How convenient. Then there\&#39;s the h a z m a t protocol: They jump into a situation without having any idea what\&#39;s in store, or how prepare for it. Did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash-down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance? I kept thinking Hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique, and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after all.&#39;,
   &#34;OK Hollywood is not liberal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I&#39;m lieing because it is. Im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie. This movie was anti bush, anti middle east , anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fist off i will give credit where credit is due. i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot was impossible for me to decode however. I have been tested and have an IQ of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story, which it very well may be, i have no idea exactly what was going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique! If you cant dazzle them with brilliance, then baffle them with Bull S.&#34;,
   &#34;I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film, and of the few reviews that there are to be positive. I saw the movie and was pretty dissapointed. I didn&#39;t find it very enjoyable at all. It was slow, and lacks the entertainment value. Even the murder scenes are lackluster, with real close-up shots of generic stabbings that don&#39;t look good at all. And the supposed great twist ending is really not much, I did see it coming, and then the ending just seemed cliche. This movie may not get much mention, but by the little that it does get, it is overrated. I would not recommend this movie.&#34;,
   &#34;I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites, budget constraints, production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. And my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn&#39;t make the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s watchable, but barely so. There are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would ya wrassle us up some Hamburger Helper Sally, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to MREs. Once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rationale for the encounter with the fearsome Rook is that it can&#39;t be killed single handedly. Yet only one scene ago, the hero making that case abandoned King to do exactly that. Huh? Vivian Woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie. But that&#39;s not saying much.&#34;,
   &#34;A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski&#39;s - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. &#39;Ask the Dust&#39; was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. In the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a &#39;wounded&#39; admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, with no touching Hollywood ending. The film adaptation stays true to the book for a while, but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism, sickness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f-ing crazy, and their love never was and never would be the real thing, no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other. This movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock. I can&#39;t believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the man\&#39;s version of &#34;Mommy Dearest.&#34; It depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are God. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone told me it was funny. No way, I say! It is sick humor at best. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who don\&#39;t understand mental illness or don\&#39;t believe what we families actually do live through.&#39;,
   &#39;OK this movie was really &#34;unique&#34; shall we say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the movie, even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie. but she said that she can\&#39;t remember to much of it. well thats her excuse but whats everyone else\&#39;s??? i can\&#39;t imagine they all had a coke problem.whatever it wasn\&#39;t all that bad i mean i guess the plot was OK and it had some pretty funny moments. although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste. oh well i guess i was disappointed cause Carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her.&#39;,
   &#34;So they hyped the violence and it&#39;s been branded as sick. Well, the violence is the best bit I&#39;m afraid, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their (entirely predictable) rampage. This film has a truly dreadful script. We never get a chance to get to know Robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic. The acting isn&#39;t much better, either, the worst of them being the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the pace enough to send you to sleep. And what on earth is the school film project all about? A comment on the film itself perhaps? The use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable. These guys obviously think they&#39;re intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth. How on earth they got the great Yorgos Arvanitis to light it I&#39;ll never know. And how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery. Absolutely awful beyond comprehension.&#34;,
   &#34;Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential, they just didn&#39;t put enough time in perfecting it. The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, but it was lacking. It&#39;s a good movie, but after you&#39;ve seen it once, you might want to see it again. This movie could of been better.&#34;,
   &#39;Who likes awful &#34;comedy&#34; shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this are: One, Muslims and self-proclaimed Liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about Muslims that it doesn\&#39;t even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). Two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left. I\&#39;d be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think it\&#39;s actually Muslims, or hip, funny young people? No, I bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you look at the CBC comedy shows there are, Air Farce was only finally just taken off the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for &#34;comedy&#34; Little Mosque on the Prairie. It is supposed to be offencive and funny? Only the CBC would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny. Shame on the CBC for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie was horrible. I swear they didn&#39;t even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. *SPOILERS Phht more like reasons not to watch it* They sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he coulda been long gone. The ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs. And when ICE-T is on that Hill and uses that Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN like its a sniper rifle (and then cuts down a tree with eight shells?? It would take 1000&#39;s of shells to cut down a tree that size.) Shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light?? I didn&#39;t see a scope on that thing. Also when he got shot in the gut and kept going, that was retarded he would of bled to death right there. PlusThe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel. It wouldn&#39;t blow up and kill him. The bullet would still fire kill Ice T but mess up the barrel.&#34;,
   &#39;It wasn\&#39;t good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories I had of the previous movie which contrasted with the \&#39;new\&#39; personalities (or lack thereof). I seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by Ariel because of how absurd it was. It was serious. It just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the Disney channel-everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most disappointing part was the horrible songs-not catchy, not amazing. In the original Ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun. You remember them and want to sing them. But the songs in this movie weren\&#39;t creative in the least; it\&#39;s as if they\&#39;re talking in a annoying sing-song voice-quite weakly, disappointing. I don\&#39;t have that want-to-sing-them feeling you normally get from a Disney movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s as if not one wanted to do this movie, so they barely made an effort . . . this movie would needs a new story line, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying &#34;look at me! look at me! I\&#39;m so annoying!&#34; mentality of this generation of Disney. :\&#39;(&#39;,
   &#39;Oh my, I think this may be the single cheesiest movie I\&#39;ve ever seen. I\&#39;m serious, this is one of the ultimate b-movies. The first proof is that it isn\&#39;t a $5 DVD. Oh no, that\&#39;s too mainstream for this. I got this on VHS, from a bin full of ex-rental videos at my local video store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I may quote the blurb: &#34;In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan.&#34; It then goes on to say &#34;A multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must have seen a different movie. This was no epic, and it certainly wasn\&#39;t a multi million dollar anything. No, \&#39;Shogun Mayeda\&#39; is really just the crazy adventures of the Engrish-speaking Mayeda (Sho Kosugi). He isn\&#39;t even a Shogun really, but thats not important. What is important, is that he does a really cool impression of John Cleese\&#39;s repeated charging of the one castle in \&#39;Monty Python and the Holy Grail\&#39;, and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest thing about this movie is Sho Kosugi\&#39;s Engrish accent. The movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie, but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines ever, delivered by the coolest Engrish accent ever. And honestly, do you really want anything else? You could fast forward \&#39;Shogun Mayeda\&#39; to the end, and replay Kosugi\&#39;s final line over and over. The tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that one line. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10 - So very very cheesy.&#39;,
   &#39;Woman with wig, who &#34;dyes&#34; her hair in the middle of the film (=takes of wig) presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** begin spoiler alert *** that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her. *** end of spoiler alert ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a spoiler that was: the title already gives it away, doesn\&#39;t it? Bad acting, bad script: waste of time Oh yeah: in the end, she lives happily ever after....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you liked this movie, you\&#39;ll really love &#34;Cannibal women in the Avocado Jungle of Death&#34;....&#39;,
   &#34;I had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end... having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom. What really horrifies me, I mean truly disturbs me, is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as &#39;delightful&#39; or a &#39;must see.&#39; I would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten. It is decidedly unfunny, poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold, canned rice pudding. To be kind to Ms Kramer, the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity, for having read the synopsis before I watched it, I had expected something more challenging. The possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co-dependence, the unexpected awakening of &#39;sisterly&#39; sexuality, and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry (for the affections of the same girl) were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration, yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations, with clichéd characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction. The lack of directorial control seems astounding; on the one hand, Moynahan, Cavanagh and Spacek all give very pedestrian performances, while Heather Graham and Molly Shannon - the latter in particular - veer towards embarrassing over-compensation at times. One could lay the blame for this on the director - maybe Sue Kramer hopes that if her actors over-act, they will force a bigger laugh from the audience. But then again, the cast is a veteran one; one would expect them to do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sue Kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make, and for whom. Given the possible issues Gray Matters alludes to, and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy, perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead. I know it is never easy to make films about women and women&#39;s issues, especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone, but whatever direction she takes, inconsequential and flimsy characters like Gray are not going to cut mustard.&#34;,
   &#39;I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first &#34;grown-up&#34; role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I\&#39;ll never get back! No noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all, I couldn\&#39;t have cared less. The story of California teens in the 1970\&#39;s, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don\&#39;t waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.&#39;,
   &#39;I was China in this film. I choose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was modeling at the time in Italy and they couldn\&#39;t pronounce my real name correctly, so I choose Sheeba and then added Alahani since it was similar to Alohalani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never acted before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to film. They gave me &#34;acting lessons&#34; each morning (which obviously were not useful). They dubbed my voice (thank goodness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David and Peter were a blast on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This film was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax write off according to inside information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had &#34;acting&#34; in it.&#39;,
   &#34;This film is overblown, predictable, pretentious, and hollow to its core. The settings are faithful to the era but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure. The lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as Bruce Willis did in Hart&#39;s War. Tom, you can&#39;t give depth to a character simply by making your face blank! The content did not warrant the histrionic acting by Paul Newman. This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.&#34;,
   &#34;i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan(releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture) ,it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences.So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction.Give us more of herapheri&#39;s and malamal weekly&#39;s rather than giving duds like garam masala!&#34;,
   &#34;Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because I was left a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where hasn&#39;t this set up been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin I can&#39;t fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately the film is pulled down by it&#39;s own designs; it&#39;s too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick. The mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#34;,
   &#34;I do have the `guts&#39; to inform you to please stay away from `Dahmer&#39;, the biographical film based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer. `Dahmer&#39; strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts, was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful `dahm&#39; project. This is not an easy film to digest, even though Jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery `brainsadillas&#39; appetizers or even some real-life `Mr. Potato skins&#39;. * Failure&#34;,
   &#34;This is one of the most atrocious rewrites I&#39;ve ever viewed. If they want to make a movie with a lousy story, they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book. There is hardly a relation between Wolfe&#39;s book and this movie other than the title. I don&#39;t mind changes if they help a story flow on screen. At least the changes shouldn&#39;t hurt the final product. The last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. The actors are miscast. The director and/or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;ve seen this movie and disliked it, try the book. If you&#39;ve seen this movie and liked it, read the book.&#34;,
   &#39;Apparently none of the previous reviewers,most of whom praise the film for its accuracy, have actually read a biography of Louis Pasteur.The most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between Pasteur and Napoleon III.Back in the 1930\&#39;s the latter was invariably shown in a bad light.While far from an admirable character-he was an inept politician and a self-appointed &#34;military genius&#34; who allowed France to be dragged into a disastrous war,he was not the stupid reactionary depicted here. He had an intelligent interest in science,and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring.Far from exiling Pasteur, he was his PATRON,building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research.While the lab was under construction, Pasteur became gravely ill.A bureaucrat, deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead, ordered work halted on his own authority.When the emperor heard about this, his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buck-passing, and work promptly resumed.The Emperor personally visited Pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab.The emperor would often bring members of his court to admire Pasteur\&#39;s projects,and it was obvious to everyone that Pasteur was one of the emperor\&#39;s favorites.Pasteur\&#39;s main worry concerning the Emperor was that Napoleon thought Pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything, and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience.Pasteur, a very modest man, was always protesting this, but Napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him,and Pasteur despite his misgivings, always came through.They always had a close and friendly relationship,and after the Emperor was overthrown, Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him,grateful to the end of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part about his daughter having the baby, and Pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor, never happened.The part about the anthrax and rabies, for which he was famous, is generally correct, but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false.He was famous and respected at the time this happened.This movie is OK from a dramatic standpoint,but very distorted as biography.&#39;,
   &#34;this video is 100% retarded. besides the brain cell killing acting and plot, it&#39;s way too long. don&#39;t waste your money at the video store. i actually was mad that i sat through this garbage and spent money on it. just absolutely awful.&#34;,
   &#34;Just because an event really happened doesn&#39;t mean that it will make a good screenplay/ movie. The Cat&#39;s Meow, by Peter Bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hurst. The writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit. The key moments of the story seem implausible; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing him to be Chaplin. Basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived. The story attempts to be a dark comedy, but The Cat&#39;s Meow misses an important piece of this equation, comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. It hardly matters who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is not a strong character to cheer for. As a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental.&#34;,
   &#39;No doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie married, it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers. If you\&#39;ve been through the ordeal of watching &#34;Swept Away,&#34; then you know at that level it was a match made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or &#34;octress&#34; as she might have pronounced it in &#34;The Next Best Thing&#34;), she still can\&#39;t get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. And that\&#39;s the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen: that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience. If there\&#39;s any justice in this universe, she just blew her last chance.&#39;,
   &#34;This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It offers nothing in the death department. The one-liners are bad and are something that shouldn&#39;t be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th one, but still one the worst movies of the series. My rating 2/10&#34;,
   &#39;Once again the same familiar story about a man (writer here) who sell his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambition in life: success. Unfunny script (we should &#34;go home and write better&#34;), ridiculous lines in order to understand the &#34;strong&#34; &#34;Christmanish&#34; message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent Hopkins beat the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is no sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character. Not bad efforts from the actors (Baldwin also as a director, Cattrall in a &#34;Sex and the City&#34; role again, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Try also a not so popular film from Greece called &#34;Alloimono stous neous&#34;, a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth)&#39;,
   &#34;The strange people living in a town go about their lives. There&#39;s the licker a guy who licks everything, a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways...offbeat in the extreme, this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color. The monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel. Like a Troma movie, this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time-not always- but enough for it not to be fun.(Though I didn&#39;t see the cleansing coming). Worth a shot if you&#39;ve nothing else to watch and you&#39;re waiting for the next set of Golden Girls to come from Netflix.&#34;,
   &#39;I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it. Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film. He failed thank God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin won\&#39;t like her because she\&#39;s ugly. The film is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits: ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit. Those two scenes made me cringe! Janeane\&#39;s character is sickeningly arrogant (and guessing from her role as stand-up &#34;comedienne&#34; and arch-feminist is in real life too). She claims that the film is &#34;anti-feminist&#34; when in fact it\&#39;s just realistic. Men more often than not go for looks over personality. It\&#39;s interesting to note her hypocrisy too. She\&#39;d been a feminist and &#34;comedienne&#34; for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. I mean come on! She acted in it for Heaven\&#39;s sake! What this film was really was anti-men if anything. It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman\&#39;s character Noelle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplin\&#39;s character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. Is that the best the script writers could come up with? Blimey they\&#39;ve never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made. There\&#39;s also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isn\&#39;t ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm was I watching the same film as they were? She\&#39;s certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. Although having said that, I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well: she\&#39;s lanky and gaunt looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee three things about this film if you\&#39;ve never watched it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will know what the ending will be;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be bored after ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch at your own peril.&#39;,
   &#39;Tobe Hooper has made great movies so I was certain this couldn\&#39;t be BAD. I didn\&#39;t read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film. At times this made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes made me almost CRY for Hooper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this 3/10 because its 1990 &#34;horror&#34;-movie and many interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the movie I was thinking something like &#34;they simply CAN\&#39;T add more things in this movie...&#34; .. but they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tell this is some sort of Firestarter clone but truly isn\&#39;t. It\&#39;s based on that idea but thats all. This is combination of horror, comedy, weird religion/god things, funny gore, simple effects, drama, horrible acting, unbelievable script..and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*spoilers* Story is: Government tries to create ultimate weapon using nuclear power or something and fails, during process child is born for 2 test persons. When mom sings to her child after the birth, both husband and wife burns and it is SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. Government buries whole thing and leaves this child live amongst other people and ... then after x years this kid is grown up and realizes he has been born for a reason and whoa he can burn things with his brains. Then everything goes unbelievable messy nothing really explains anything and .. Well when The Government realizes &#34;okay now he can set this fire thing to work&#34; they take him to normal hospital where is some nuclear toxic what they are going to use on this man BECAUSE they could kill him, no they can\&#39;t shoot him no! .. and argh, I guess thats enough to tell, I promise there is 100 more weird things in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well if you want good laughs watch this one. Gosh.&#39;,
   &#39;(BIG SPOILERS) I\&#39;ve seen one other Takashi Miike film, and that was the very disturbing and brutal \&#39;Audition\&#39;, which was an examination of the Japanese ideals of femininity! In \&#39;Visitor Q\&#39;- which I think means \&#39;Visitor Question\&#39;- he examines, in a very disturbingly gross way, the family unit. Miike\&#39;s surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be Lynchian in terms of confusion and film-making, but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue. We, the audience, are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure (Kenichi Endo- who was actually quite good) paying for sex with his displaced daughter (Fujiko). Then, as the father returns home, he is struck on the head by &#34;the visitor&#34; (Kazushi Watanabe) wielding a fairly sizeable rock, and for some reason, they both end up back at the family home. The mother (Shungiku Uchida) is beaten and bullied by her son (Jun Muto) who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers. When the visitor enters the home, he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit. Eventually, the family begin to improve their relationship, with assistance from the visitor, through milking breasts, murder and retaining a sense of family pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together. It\&#39;s has uncomfortable humour, but is equally frustratingly silly, and over-the-top in its weirdness. There is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting, but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses. Partly because of the situation itself, and partly because you can\&#39;t believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this! The style of the film is poor to say the least, and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak. The characters themselves are all over the place, and while I understand this is not meant to be realistic, there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd! The camera-work is sloppy, and doesn\&#39;t have that cinematic feel that Lynch\&#39;s work entails. It\&#39;s hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level, or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in Japan. It just seems that Miike was out to shock, and the film seems self-aware that it\&#39;s &#34;trying&#34; to be shocking, and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously. All in all, I would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy, but it looks and feels amateurish, and seems to unnecessarily want to shock. Miike\&#39;s previous film, Audition, was finely balanced between disgusting horror, character development and technique- which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot. \&#39;Visitor Q\&#39; is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting, without really having much to say in the process! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** out of *****!&#39;,
   &#34;The plot of this terrible film is so convoluted I&#39;ve put the spoiler warning up because I&#39;m unsure if I&#39;m giving anything away. The audience first sees some man in Jack the Ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago. Then we&#39;re up to modern day and a young Australian couple is looking for a house. We&#39;re given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror. Some 105 year old woman lived there. There are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den. An old fashioned straight-razor falls out when they&#39;re renovating and the husband keeps it. I guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams. Oh yeah, the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person. Late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money &amp; the husband murders the body guard &amp; a co-worker and steals the money. His wife is suddenly pregnant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the hell is going on?? Who knows?? NOTHING is explained. Was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer? The baby sister? WHY were iron panels put on the wall? How would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar? Was he locked down there by his family &amp; starved to death or just concealed? WHO is Mr. Hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels?? He&#39;s never seen again. WHY was the serial killer killing people? We only see the one old man murdered. Was there a pattern or motive or something?? WHY does the wife suddenly become pregnant? Is it the demon spawn of the serial killer? Has he managed to infiltrate the husband&#39;s semen? And why, if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge, burly security guard, is he unable to overpower his wife? And just how powerful is the voltage system in Australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire? And why does the wife stay in the house? Is she now possessed by the serial killer? Is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was such a frustrating experience I wanted to call my PBS station and ask for my money back! The ONLY enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time, but even that couldn&#39;t redeem this muddled, incoherent mess.&#34;,
   &#39;I loved Dewaere in Series Noir. His talent is trivialized in &#34;The Waltzers&#34; aka &#34;Going Places&#34;. Okay, it\&#39;s a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most absurd and irredeemable ways; many folks find such behavior amusing. This was a boring, pointless exercise designed to shock. I find the smirk on Blier\&#39;s face, the face behind the camera, annoying. Series Noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and licentious behavior. From the first moment when we see Patric Dewaere prancing in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the bewilderingly beautiful anti-hero we\&#39;ll be spending time with for the next couple of hours. When we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy Depardieu in &#34;Going Places&#34; we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soul-draining. I have trouble eking even a &#34;3&#34; for this annoying distraction.&#39;,
   &#39;Most movies I can sit through easily, even if I do not particularly like the movie. I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre. This is the first movie I could not stand to watch. Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen--and I\&#39;ve seen a lot of movies. The acting is okay (Myers is good as the cat, it\&#39;s just that he is REALLY annoying). The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous, even for the children in the audience. The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The &#34;witty&#34; parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a &#34;ho&#34;). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can\&#39;t stand it, I do not know how any adults can. I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it. I HATED IT! So, in summary, do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this! See a GOOD movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10 stars--the lowest review I have ever given a movie.&#39;,
   &#39;Let me start by stating that I usually do like Renny Harlin\&#39;s directing style, for the most part, and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots. Unlike Harlin\&#39;s &#34;Elm Street 4&#34;, and &#34;Die Hard 2&#34; which I really liked, there is something that is missing from this movie. That, my friends, is a script. The dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful, but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity. There are so many awful lines in this movie, I don\&#39;t even want to have to remember any of them. Not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure. It\&#39;s almost like Harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said, they could improve the script. Wrong again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue. Stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is acting circles around Lithgow, Turner, and the worst of the bunch Rooker, there is something wrong with this picture. Lithgow played one of the best villains in &#34;Ricochet&#34;, yet comes across as someone who can\&#39;t act to save his life here. How is that possible? I\&#39;ve always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by Stallone, who himself still phoned-in his performance. Turner\&#39;s part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen. Michael Rooker CAN act. I know this because I have witnessed it in &#34;Days of Thunder&#34;, but he seems like he is READING his lines from cue cards. Has it come to this? When Rooker and Lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, I just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. Unfortunately, neither of those things occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me back to Harlin, who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. It\&#39;s his fault that I was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made the people actually act. The script is not very good, but still the actors\&#39; performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. I don\&#39;t care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are good, you still can\&#39;t just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the pacing of this movie seems to be off. The opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. I mean I understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene, but I really didn\&#39;t care if they got the money or not in that scene. If the bad guy\&#39;s would have won early, maybe I wouldn\&#39;t have had to witness one of the worst movies ever!&#39;,
   &#34;This film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure It had 30 actors After JAANI DUSHMAN(2002) i guess no one had the guts to do something like that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film as the title suggests is based on the Kargil war but the problem is there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with knifes, wonder which soldier does that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direction by JP Dutta pales front of BORDER Music is okay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amongst the huge cast Ajay Devgan stands tall, Saif is very good in his part and also it&#39;s his first film with kareena, Abhishek is likable Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna does his part well rest are passable Rani is good, Esha is okay rest are passable&#34;,
   &#34;This seems like two films: one a dreary, pretentious lengthy saga about an ac-tor who is taken over by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side. She drops heavy hints about the need for connections, her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modelling game. I love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain, and her terrible seducing outfit of navel-revealing, puff-sleeved crochet top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do actors get Oscars for Shakespeare? We know they Oscars for impersonating disabled people, wearing a lot of prosthetics, or pretending to be mad. The Shakespearean scenes (which go ON and ON) are embarrassing and dated. And so are the &#39;going mad&#39; scenes where Tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice-over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy. When he quotes his father&#39;s advice, he slips into a Cockney accent.&#34;,
   &#34;Down to Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who gets hit by a truck. He goes to Heaven and he gets to get another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does a few things in the body of Charles. The movie has a few laughs, but it&#39;s nothing special. It&#39;s a good movie if you&#39;re a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done way better things than this. It will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. And it&#39;s not really laugh-out-loud funny. You&#39;ll laugh to yourself and you might giggle, but you definitely won&#39;t be rolling on the floor laughing.&#34;,
   &#34;There is a DVD published in the UK in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the cover, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disk, no IFPI code in the inner rim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably a straight transfer from VHS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no much point is commenting an adult film. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. It was shown in the United States in normal cinemas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve seen it In Pensylvannia way back in 1975.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies. The DVD has no special features and no subtitles, and was probably made using a VHS tape as source&#34;,
   &#39;I am a Christian and I say this movie had terrible acting, unreal situations and a completely facade front for Christianity. You might as well watch &#34;Remember the Titans&#34; and at least not mix Christ in a football film like a formulaic steroid for losers. Let me make some really pressing comments of what bothered me in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academy school. I did not notice a single black student or player in the school. I deal with the White &#34;Christian&#34; Academies in the south and they were built for no other reason than to reestablish segregation. This is troubling when the movie is about Christianity and Christ changing lives...how about changing the hearts of segregation? (note: I loved the token black coach; like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black \&#39;Giants\&#39; players.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The uncritical acclaim by everyone Christian about this movie. Can I get a couple people to say that it was bad acting, bad filming, bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies. If we were to compare this to another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The half-baked Christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending. If Christianity is about simply reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change, then don\&#39;t wonder when no one will listen to what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a cure-all. He doesn\&#39;t need sold and He doesn\&#39;t need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles. No wonder everyone considers Christianity to be anti-intellectual with this unreal presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people. To most, it will not be. It will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension. Most importantly to me, it is not Christian by any means or stretch. It has values but it falls short as a \&#39;pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps\&#39; message as shallow as positive thinking. If you live alongside people who struggle and/or those in third world living conditions, this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion.&#39;,
   &#34;You know when you&#39;re on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti&#39;s taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. He also finds time to slag off films that he doesn&#39;t like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely being in a position like his you&#39;d think he&#39;d try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. By making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn&#39;t completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. The next time someone you don&#39;t know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a slap from me. Every blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.&#34;,
   &#34;A Cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The Cinderella plot till the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you&#39;re looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, this is definitely you&#39;re movie, but for the rest of us real world people, I&#39;d highly recommend saving your three hour watch time. Wake up people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I&#39;m missing something.. I just can&#39;t believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS!!&#34;,
   &#34;Despite the (English) title, this seems to have little to do with Devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the Philospher&#39;s Stone &amp; wants gold made from lead (&amp; virgin&#39;s blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood. He&#39;s basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he&#39;s employed and it&#39;s more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks, and the film at least has a good look to it, but otherwise there&#39;s little about this to recommend. Little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all, and most unusual, for a Molina/Naschy film, not really any unintentional humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.&#34;,
   &#39;Well, maybe the PC version of this game was impressive. Maybe. I just finished playing the PS2 version and it\&#39;s pretty much a complete mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple elements that are okay or promising. I\&#39;ll mention those first because it will be over quickly. First, the idea of a historical GTA-like game is a great one. The game Gun was a historical GTA-like game and unlike Mafia, Gun was excellent. I\&#39;d love to see a game set during Mafia\&#39;s era done right. Next, the storyline is well written. The story makes sense, it has dramatic arcs, it uses an unusual device (with much of the game being a backstory) and it\&#39;s interesting. Finally, some of the graphics--especially those used during cutscenes--are impressive. Mafia\&#39;s designers seemed to focus on getting the graphics right in the places where GTA skimped on that effort, especially the characters. Unfortunately in many other areas, the graphics kinda stink, and I\&#39;d much rather have excellent gameplay than impressive-looking characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gameplay is what sinks this title so low. First off, the controls and camera absolutely suck. That has to be the first focus of any game developers. You can\&#39;t release a game where the controls and/or camera suck. Number one, there\&#39;s no reason that the player\&#39;s character, Tom, can\&#39;t have his full range of motion controlled by the left analog stick. Unless it\&#39;s absolutely necessary, and it hardly ever is, I hate the set-up where the left stick moves the character in a &#34;strafing&#34; way and the character can only turn using the right analog stick. Here, it\&#39;s not only unnecessary, it makes most of the simplest actions a challenge. For example, Tom has to climb on a couple missions. But the game is designed so poorly that you have to frustratingly keep manipulating both the right analog stick and the camera, and then press L1 every time you need to climb, or Tom will descend instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I\&#39;ve never seen a worse fighting system. The first problem is that you can\&#39;t auto-aim or lock on to any targets. At one early point, the game seems to tell you that you can use L2 or R2 to lock on to targets, but that never worked. So to focus on any enemy, you have to struggle with the stupid right analog stick and try to keep adjusting both the character\&#39;s orientation and the camera, which tends to drift to the wrong angle or make Tom disappear all the time. By that time, you\&#39;re probably getting pummeled or shot to death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, if you\&#39;re touching or almost touching an enemy--and that\&#39;s certainly going to be the case for hand to hand combat or when using melee weapons, the fighting system--which primarily consists of tapping or holding R1, is completely useless. Enemies can pummel you almost in a bear hug, but you just can\&#39;t move unless you back off. So close fighting tends to consist of you yanking on the left analog stick, yelling at the character to move away, which it won\&#39;t do 50% of the time, then tapping R1 as much as you can before the enemy gets too close again and makes R1 useless. And if the enemy changes their angle to you in the meantime, you\&#39;re also going to struggle with the right analog stick to get your character oriented in the right way and to get the camera in position so you can see anything. By that time, you\&#39;re probably getting pummeled or shot again, and your only option will be to try to move the character away again. My fights often consisted of making Tom run circles around an area like a comedy film, hoping that I could gain enough time to struggle with the analog stick and get a couple shots in before being at the AI\&#39;s mercy again. So much for realistic fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the same problems and more exist when trying to fight with guns. If you\&#39;re touching someone, half the time the controller just won\&#39;t allow you to fire off a shot, yet they can still riddle you full of holes. Additionally, there\&#39;s no auto-aim, and the aiming system is ridiculously sensitive, even with the sensitivity set to zero under Options. Gunfights tend to consist of you hopelessly trying to aim or move away while the enemy puts shot after shot into you. Luckily or not, damage seems to be recorded almost randomly. It can take one to ten shots or more to incapacitate any character, and there\&#39;s no rhyme or reason to it. You can put five shots into an enemy\&#39;s head and near point blank range and they\&#39;ll still return fire and hurt you. Yet, the game designers seemed to care enough about realism than they built a recoil into your aiming system, so after shots with powerful enough guns, your aim will float off target, and you\&#39;ll have to fight with it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the celebrated graphics, except for the characters and textures that you\&#39;re close to, they\&#39;re actually pretty disappointing. The distance always seems mostly empty, and there are often expanses of flat colors and textures nearby when you\&#39;re driving. The city wasn\&#39;t very well designed. It\&#39;s not varied enough, and there aren\&#39;t many interesting things to see or do. The cars seem slow and they\&#39;re difficult to control. They also all drive about the same. Some have mentioned the music, but that was also pretty nondescript. A much better job could have been done on that end. Also, as many others have mentioned, the load times are ridiculous and constant. They tend to be over a minute long, and they occur between and in the middle of everything--even races.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Mafia port to PS2, at least, seems to have been very rushed. The game feels and plays like an incomplete hack job.&#39;,
   &#34;One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become satire, is that it be somewhat plausible. I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended. But I&#39;ll leave that to the physicists who might have seen Solar Crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand. They&#39;re getting close to Earth, so much so that it&#39;s become unseasonably hot, as if the entire Earth were Death Valley. The answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there. That will divert the flares off in say the direction of say Mercury providing it&#39;s not in direct alignment with the Earth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who to deliver it, but captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son, Corin Nemec. Taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson&#39;s father, and Nemec&#39;s grandfather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a villain here too, Peter Boyle who is the CEO of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world&#39;s food supply for the survivors. The idea he might not survive doesn&#39;t enter into his thinking. He&#39;s doing his best to sabotage Matheson&#39;s mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solar Crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001, A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Boyle seems to be taking his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he&#39;s the only one in the cast who realizes he&#39;s in a turkey and overacts accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the cast are stalwart, true blue and dull. Except possibly desert rat Jack Palance who finds Nemec and cares for him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key here is that the film was directed by that noted Hollywood purveyor of flop films, Allen Smithee. The film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a Thanksgiving carving.&#34;,
   &#34;Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film, I was also waxing nostalgic about it...before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Alas, my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy, and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring film-making. Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can&#39;t overcome a rancid screenplay, a horrible theme song, and some wretched &#39;special effects&#39;. In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement. Michael Weldon&#39;s original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release. Judging from the results, that is a completely believable (and baffling) scenario.&#34;,
   &#39;Watching this again recently, I found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen, even if the shoestring budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure. By any objective measure this was a disaster, but I found it easy to imagination how good a Lord of the Rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely - and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, that will not be possible for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all, then this story simply couldn\&#39;t be stuffed up. Fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film. There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that Peter Jackson did it, although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution. The way they tried to show the wraith world from Frodo\&#39;s point of view for example. Or the way that Galadriel showed Sam what was happening back home for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I really appreciated in this version - the silent moments. There were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still back-drop. Compare that to the grandiose swooping camera of the Jackson films, and the intrusive score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched. Jackson\&#39;s films were full of their own importance, this was quieter and a lot more modest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackson and co hit this with more than US$270 million dollars in production costs, at least $90 million dollars more for marketing, a massive tax break from the NZ government, and also gained massive savings from filming in NZ not the USA. However, despite the marketing claims, the intention to be faithful was never there. This is well documented. Philippa Boyens said as much in an interview, when she said they deliberately didn\&#39;t re-read the books before writing the script. Jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film &#34;along the lines of&#34; the lord of the rings, and that the one he really wanted to do was Return of the King, because it had a lot of battles but no character development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, this film tried to be more true. Of course a lot of things were wrong, the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything, and the pace was too fast. Naturally they cut a lot, and adapted other scenes, and for this they deserve credit. While Jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose, Bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway. There\&#39;s actually a curious similarity between the structure of the Jackson and Bakshi films near the beginning - in that they both deviate from the original books in the same way - although of course some of this could be coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not a good film, but the potential was there. Bakshi said in an interview to the Onion AV club that only animation could do the lord of the rings justice. His version didn\&#39;t work, but he might have been right.&#39;,
   &#39;I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. I was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so I have only myself to blame. But like most, I didn\&#39;t believe all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just Sandler haters. I couldn\&#39;t have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny. That is actually quite an accomplish. You\&#39;d think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing. But no, it\&#39;s just horrible. It\&#39;s not &#34;so bad it\&#39;s good&#34;, its just bad. You cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity. Don\&#39;t. Please don\&#39;t. Trust me, I\&#39;m doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those that think Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those that have not yet seen it.&#39;,
   &#39;The only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER: they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions. They blame bears and deer for &#34;misbehaving&#34; by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie, supposedly a thriller, had about five sub-plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end, but it ended up more as a yawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing was trite, the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym, Matt Damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business, oil and the Middle-East. I have seen documentaries provide more excitement. Watch it only if there&#39;s absolutely nothing else to do.&#34;,
   &#39;I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a &#34;thumbs in the middle&#34; review, remarking that I\&#39;d give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. I\&#39;ve seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is utter crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything\&#39;s wrong with it. Everything. Getting past just the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for God\&#39;s sake...is it just me, or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE?? Is Gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system? Or, again, is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see &#34;no character development&#34;, above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to make matters worse, every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Joker gasses people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Joker sets out to gas the whole city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Batman saves the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pfeh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one episode I saw that wasn\&#39;t a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster...the &#34;Think Thank Thunk&#34; episode with the quiz show. That was the single-worst Batman story I\&#39;ve ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than &#34;I\&#39;ve Got Batman in My Basement.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t really say what I feel this show is because it\&#39;s probably against the ToS, but it starts with &#34;B&#34; and rhymes with &#34;fastardization&#34;. Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm/Dini/etc. era of Bat-entertainment, back from the Fox and Kids WB days. Stuff that good, and I should have known this, just couldn\&#39;t possibly have lasted forever, unfortunately.&#39;,
   &#34;This film was a critical and box-office fiasco back in 1957. It was based on a novel which was later turned into a play--which flopped on Broadway. The story is about some navy officers on leave in San Francisco during WWII. They have 4 day&#39;s leave which they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama--but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesn&#39;t really pull it off. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn was initially set to play opposite Grant, but had other commitments--so Suzy parker stepped in. She had never acted before, but was America&#39;s top photographic model at the time. I think that she did a good job, considering all the pressure that she was under. Grant&#39;s pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few brief scenes--did not really work. The Studio was trying to give her some class by acting with Grant--but the character had no substance at all.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;The Dream Child&#34; of 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated) &#34;Nightmare&#34; series, and at the latest from this point on, the series became total garbage. The only good films in the series were Wes Craven\&#39;s 1984 original, and the third part, &#34;The Dream Warriors&#34; of 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for (admittedly great) visuals, and one creepy scene, a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came into existence. The rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester yelling stupid one-liners, and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses, who desperately try to avoid falling asleep, because good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, such as a super-dumb \&#39;eerie\&#39; children\&#39;s rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel... In Short: No originality, just a decline of the old formula, and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals, and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel, &#34;Freddy\&#39;s Dead&#34;, which is awful beyond belief. In case you\&#39;re not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast, &#34;The Dream Child&#34; should be avoided, and even if you are, this is more than likely to disappoint.&#39;,
   &#39;This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it sucked bad! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The &#34;wolf&#34;, if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth. When it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like he\&#39;s running in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it\&#39;s been waxed, all shiny :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed, they didn\&#39;t do a good job at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t even get me started on the actors... Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall boring and laughable horror.&#39;,
   &#39;Dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise: a young Mafia would-to-be killer (Chandler) must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to California to take some lessons with a very known professional killer (Beluschi). First and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee) that is a completely strange for all of them. But is she a easy target? The movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just bad routine; even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give this a 4 (four).&#39;,
   &#39;We all know a movie never does complete justice to the book, but this is exceptional. Important characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were essentially mushed into the same character, most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara\&#39;s clairvoyance was extremely downplayed, making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one I got to know in the book. In the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people, which in turn was a key element in the life of the family. In the movie she was no more than some special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third-, by the way, is the son and thus comes after Segundo-second-) and its connections to that between Esteban and his grandson from Pancha García (not son, who he also did recognize) is chopped in half and its importance downplayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of: this is called &#34;The House of the Spirits.&#34; Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the &#34;big house on the corner,&#34; a line stated so many times in the novel. The house in fundamental to the story, but the movie unjustly relegates it to a mere backdrop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn\&#39;t read the book before, I would have never guessed that such a sappy, shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie is really goofy! I saw it as an 11 year old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12. I really didn&#39;t care for it, but I do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of, such as: 1)Does money buy happiness? 2)Should I lie (to my parents) about things I think they wouldn&#39;t approve of? 3)Does money buy friendships? 4)Is money everything? 5)Shouldn&#39;t I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? Granted, these are very unrealistic situations, but I do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video as well, in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt.&#34;,
   &#34;I have to say that I used to be a huge fan of the series. The first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a shame since this was a great series and it just keeps getting worse. I know they are made for DVD films but some effort would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no laughs, just a couple of good one-liners that will bring a smile if that. There is pretty of nudity and very hot chicks. But neither the sexy stuff nor the jokes really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to all that this is a RACIST film too or as racist of a film one can make without asking to be called racist. I am NOT one of those people who think everything should be politically correct. But the portrayal of minorities is very offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#39;t waste any time on this garbage. See the previous versions, they will make you laugh not sick.&#34;,
   &#39;This film had so much promise. I was very excited about this film. In the end, it was laughable at best, painful at worst. The acting styles ran the gamut from really, really, flat (the angels, the wife and daughter) to over-animated (Casper\&#39;s character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the scene regarding &#34;the bug&#34;. It\&#39;s pretty much an insult to the audience\&#39;s ability to figure things out. In defense of that scene, though, it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie. I had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations. Too bad they didn\&#39;t make use of it. I didn\&#39;t feel like I was transported to exotic locations. Anybody could insert stock footage of the Coliseum in Rome. However, to end on a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers. It is my opinion(and that\&#39;s all it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much much lower and the ACTION factor would have been greatly increased, this film would have been good.&#39;,
   &#39;This is the only movie I have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site, and that is a significant statement from someone who likes &#34;The Attack of the Monolith Monsters.&#34; This movie is perfect for anyone who wants an inoffensive movie. It is devoid of sex and violence, for example. I believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged, or stimulated in any way. Adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the TV while the kids watch this movie. Don\&#39;t be surprise ,however, if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the TV off and started a board game. As an adult who enjoys being entertained, who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism, drama, comedy, and action, all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and/or stimulate the imagination, this movie has nothing to offer.&#39;,
   &#39;Relying on the positive reviews above, we saw a free screening of this last night. Now I KNOW that filmmakers plant positive reviews, because there is no way an objective individual could have written these. &#34;Destined to become a \&#39;cult classic\&#39;&#34;?? The theater was packed, apparently with friends and families of the production crew, because only a few of us walked out by the first hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs were the most literal I\&#39;ve ever heard in a musical \x96 &#34;don\&#39;t take the short cut, honey, there\&#39;s a wolf in the woods..&#34;. Debi Mazar\&#39;s eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, ex N\&#39;Syncer, living up to his last name as he\&#39;s not aged well. He\&#39;s not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school-quality makeup and out-of-tune singing. Seriously, this guy was in vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate, but can\&#39;t do much about the unimaginative script. You know, it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time \x96 see under &#34;Pixar&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the virtual sets looked nice and were well-integrated with the actors. And it wasn\&#39;t as offensive as &#34;Crash&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;Irene Dunne finished her illustrious career with this so-so movie. She should have gone out with a bang, being the classy actress she was, not in this unmemorable, almost unknown film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightweight comedy is okay, but nothing special. The first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit. Even her high-pitched voice got a bit annoying in here. Rumor has it she was not happy with this film. One can see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom. Speaking of that, I thought David Nelson from the Ozzie &amp; Harriet TV show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded just like Nelson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, so-so at best and a sub-par ending for a great actress.&#39;,
   &#39;This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks any acting skill, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. You actually hear serious dialogue that goes, &#34;I love you more.&#34; &#34;No, I love YOU more.&#34; I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn\&#39;t take it anymore. Her &#34;southern girl charm&#34; just doesn\&#39;t work and is really quite annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do this, or did he fall for Papa Joe\&#39;s (Jessica\&#39;s dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits? Hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the movie a better rating. No one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica has lots of money, right? Maybe buy some acting lessons?&#39;,
   &#34;Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn&#39;t come anywhere close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . There is no camaraderie between Heero(Ajay Devgan) and Raj(Prashant raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen was trying their best but no use. Rajpal Yadav&#39;s voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless. Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. Rest of the cast was below expectation. The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ram Gopal Varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this Aag. But there is no fire.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;A Guy Thing&#34; tries to capture the feeling of &#34;There\&#39;s Something About Mary&#34; or &#34;Meet the Parents&#34; but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting-room rejects of those two films. Thankfully I rented it on a 5-day rental because I couldn\&#39;t sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The premise is decent and I liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for Paul\&#39;s missteps (the checker at the Save-mart was great) but the script-writing is absolutely horrible. The dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight-gag is stuck in for no good reason. Plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t get me wrong, slapstick humor is great when it\&#39;s smartly done as in the other films I mentioned, but this movie simply misses the mark. Too bad as I love Julia Stiles (Ten Things I Hate About You was great) but even that couldn\&#39;t help me sit through this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go rent &#34;There\&#39;s Something About Mary&#34; one more time.&#39;,
   &#39;This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down, but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that &#34;Freddy\&#39;s Dead&#34; is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring, pointless, and nearly death free. The horrible 3-D ending and over-the-top CORNY kills are enough to drive this &#34;film&#34; into the ground. However, it doesn\&#39;t stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of cheesy cameos and you\&#39;ve got yourself this heaping pile of guano! It\&#39;s no wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two postmortem appearances. I would too if I went out like that. This is a strictly fans only movie, don\&#39;t stare at our shame.&#39;,
   &#39;It\&#39;s difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong, because I think the problem begins with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories, but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an Africa that does not exist. He\&#39;s done for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not as successfully, but based in as much fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I realised this, it ceased to gall me that Jill Scott, an American singer/actress, is cast as Mma Ramotswe. If she is to represent a land that is not Africa, how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not African? She\&#39;s not the only American on the cast; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far, far too young for the roles they\&#39;re playing, and far too glamorous. Both brutally murder the local accents, and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting. Scott\&#39;s Mma Ramotswe is bouncy, cute and soft. Rose\&#39;s Mma Makutsi is an annoying motor-mouthed bitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is almost unwatchable. The principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who turns in a decent performance as Mr JLB Matekoni. Hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books, but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for this - he\&#39;s a shining light in an ocean of suckage. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, McCall Smith\&#39;s writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad. He refuses to be edited. As a result, his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific, and characters that change name mid-sentence. It is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue is now largely Anglicised. Characters speak of &#34;opening up&#34; and &#34;sensitivity to needs&#34;. Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni flirt openly. Mma Makutsi moans about not having a computer, but given her constantly restyled hair, makeup and jewellery, I\&#39;m surprised she doesn\&#39;t have a MacBook in her handbag along with her Visa card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are we left with here? It\&#39;s difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly, most of the things I like about the original books are apocryphal anyway. McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana populated with cute, non-threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom-nuggets. It reads well despite linguistic travesty, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were. It just isn\&#39;t true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that, it\&#39;s hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does. It remains to be seen whether European and American audiences will even notice, however.&#39;,
   &#34;I think its time for Seagal to go quietly into the night. What I have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90&#39;s smash hits in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human&#39;s adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. Somehow Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world...or something. Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans, every time I look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well I know Steven&#39;s athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him? Usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close. Like I said, it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting. The problem was it wasn&#39;t really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb Seagal killed them all singlehandedly? I guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 out of 10&#34;,
   &#39;Having just seen this on TMC, it\&#39;s fresh in my mind. It\&#39;s obvious that while the stooges are featured stars, they don\&#39;t really run the show. First, they\&#39;re broken into 2 groups - Moe, as &#34;Shorty&#34; and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants, so there\&#39;s not a whole lot of full team work. The love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability, there\&#39;s another group of musical stooges that are unfunny, unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish. The music is tiresome, they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses, the dorky western wear is silly, and there\&#39;s an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera. By the way, this is obviously after Curley\&#39;s first stroke, and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early on in an uncredited role. I loved everything these guys ever did, including all the non-Curley stuff, but this little dogie is pretty lousy.&#39;,
   &#39;Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Production: MGM &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mediocre \&#39;B\&#39; mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with Simon as director. Surely he could have fit another Red Skelton film or two on his schedule! Anyway, Grand Central Murder is a shameless rip-off of the Thin Man films minus the wit, charm, and chemistry of the leads. We are treated to a paper thin plot that can barely support its 73 minutes, bad acting and weary gags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Heflin and Virginia Grey play Nick and Nora Char--er, Rocky and Butch Custer. He\&#39;s a PI and she\&#39;s his wife and sleuthing partner. They engage in &#34;humorous&#34; banter with each other. See? It\&#39;s completely different already. Heflin\&#39;s the only one here who hints at bigger and better things, although he\&#39;s real close to being a jerk in this. Virginia Grey was in Another Thin Man, but again, let me stress, THIS FILM IS NOTHING LIKE THAT ONE, no sir. And just in case we start to think that this film is absolutely nothing like another film (say, THE THIN MAN) we actually like, Sam Levene pops up as the lead detective who\&#39;s kind of dim and has to have Van Heflin subtly direct him toward all the important leads. Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quickly, the \&#39;murder\&#39; is that of bitchy schemer Mida King, who likes to trade up on rich men until she finds an even richer one. She\&#39;s played by Patricia Dane, who\&#39;s like a C- version of Hedy Lamarr, until she opens her mouth and turns into an F. There\&#39;s a whole array of wacky suspects, all with their own motivation for wanting Mida dead. There\&#39;s the society type, the tough talking dames, the thug, the ex-lover, and a shady theater impresario (Tom Conway, here saddled with the unlikely character name of \&#39;Frankie Ciro\&#39;). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, jittery type, something I believe he may have done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot cop who, in a running gag that won\&#39;t quit, can\&#39;t stop thinking about the piece of ass he\&#39;s got waiting for him once this case gets wrapped up (that\&#39;s right, Millard Mitchell, swordsman). Finally, in a completely ground breaking method of storytelling, something we\&#39;ve never seen before, all the suspects are gathered up in one place where they tell their stories (as flashbacks) to the detective, as Rocky takes mental notes, until eventually the guilty person is compelled to dramatically blurt out a confession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the actual picture being a dud, I naively thought going in that there might be a couple of location shots of the actual 1942-era Grand Central, but alas, no. There\&#39;s merely one very brief shot at the beginning. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. So, to sum up, a wee bit formulaic, but Heflin was okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*½ out of 4&#39;,
   &#39;If you can make it thru &#34;classic Meyer&#34; titles/intro, you can wade thru anything. But would you want to? I did not find a lot there to dig my teeth into. I suppose if you go into it with low enuff expectations you will be delighted (a la Charlie\&#39;s Angels.) But for my money I\&#39;d like a little something more, more visual, more moving. More. I feel like I\&#39;m begging for gruel @ the foot of the master . the mans got the goods . but he just won\&#39;t share.&#39;,
   &#34;and shot in Vancouver with the &#39;mountains&#39; of the low country of South Carolina visible in the background. For heaven&#39;s sake, they should have reset the location. There are no coastal mountains in South Carolina. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lame visuals. They should have been beautiful. And the story limped along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#39;t understand why it was such a hit as a book, although I have to admit it&#39;s one I haven&#39;t read as yet. Usually I read the book and give the film a miss. There was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book, or even borrow it from the library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: The Mermaid Chair seemed pretty shallow to moi.&#34;,
   &#34;I can&#39;t believe it, IMDb really does have every TV show known to man! I have not seen this show in over 20 years. I only remember two episodes, and I barely remember those. I remember that Tony may not been on from the start, because one of the episodes I remember is the one in which everybody trying to get Tony to join, but he rejects them, but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of Power House, with everybody cheering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other one I remember is the one where Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead,(complete with funeral and mourners). I don&#39;t remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those shows that I convinced myself that I must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of it.&#34;,
   &#39;This show made me feel physically sick, and totally detached from British society as a whole. It was programmes such as this and Blue Peter that pretended that there were/are no class divisions in Britain. They\&#39;d always say things like; &#34;Go into your loft and you may find this..&#34; or &#34;Go into your back garden tonight and...&#34; - what about us \&#39;scummy\&#39; working class kids who never never had a &#34;loft&#34;, and a &#34;back garden&#34; which was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block? Public service broadcasting - yeah right! And on top of that, it was awfully depressing to see those stupid, middle class, up-their-own-backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having \&#39;fun\&#39;... do me a favour, and &#34;why don\&#39;t you&#34; go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on &#34;Mama and Papa\&#39;s&#34; money... you make me sick&#39;,
   &#34;... Bad at being intentionally bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gem shot straight onto the MST3k big screen. While it&#39;s obvious the movie isn&#39;t trying to be taken seriously (Hopefully that their goal, anyway...), the movie is still plain bad. Hell, it makes Leprechaun In Space look big budgeted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: Paint my muscle car prune colored!&#34;,
   &#34;I am definitely a Burt Reynolds fan, but sorry, this one really stinks. Most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie. I can&#39;t believe he even made this one. Is he actually that hard up for money?&#34;,
   &#39;VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be something of a big disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay, along with Robert Towne, it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished Buzz Kulik. Firstly, top billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He\&#39;s not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one note performance lacks the fire and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought to the role. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed up like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Also, second billed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture! His part as a biplane flying ace lobbing home-made bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star. Mitch hasn\&#39;t a decent line in the entire movie and brings to one\&#39;s mind his other Mexican revolution picture the far superior &#34;Bandido&#34; (1956) which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on DVD. Besides lacking any kind of style &#34;Villa Rides&#34; also suffers badly without the presence of a female star! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect Panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive Maurice Jarre theme tune doesn\&#39;t help matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is Paramount\&#39;s wont there are no extras - not even a trailer! Yup, a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better.&#39;,
   &#39;Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever watched was &#34;42nd Street.&#34; I then expected all of his stuff to be that good. I found out that wasn\&#39;t necessarily the case, even here, with my all-time favorite classic-era actor James Cagney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as always, but the story is like many of the others and quite tiresome. They seem to always involve screaming, unhappy show producers. In this film, it\&#39;s Cagney who winds up shouting things out so often that he gives me a headache after awhile and his character wears thin....fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the songs in here are anywhere near &#34;42nd Street&#34; class, songs you could hum for years and years - decades, I should say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of the few early Cagney films - and Berkeley films - I totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching.&#39;,
   &#34;Released in 1965, but clearly shot years earlier, this is an inept little crime melodrama with some inept sexploitation up front. As usual for grindhouse flicks of era, there&#39;s a fair amount of undressing and dressing for no reason complemented by lousy music, annoying narration, and awkward editing. The coffee shop scene lays the excruciating groundwork, as we chop back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines. All we get are reaction shots to the off-screen character&#39;s voice! 50s-pretty Misty Ayers strips to her French-cut panties a couple of times before the action gets started. She&#39;s accompanied continuously by what is apparently stock music from romantic to western to mother-does-the-dishes, mixed randomly to produce, among other things, the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film. Watch as he taps it! Watch as he strikes the match! Will he inhale or will he be captured by Apaches? Only time will tell!! The film tells the sordid tale of how Sally gets tricked into working in a whorehouse, falls for a dope, and can&#39;t escape. For some reason, we&#39;re treated to some of the most bored and boring hookers ever committed to film, literally doing their nails or knitting rather than entertaining the clientèle. Some stupendously lame comedy (boozy dame accidentally drinks milk! Har dee har!) and silent film acting doesn&#39;t help. This is one of the worst feature films I&#39;ve ever seen, even on the Something Weird Video marquee. It&#39;s really more of a film curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema--very bad cinema.&#34;,
   &#39;So far after week two of &#34;The lone of Beauty&#34; I am a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the acting is good, as long as we except that it is only drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is &#34;factual&#34; coverage of the &#34;Thatcher&#34; years - it is okay as drama, but I feel the award winning book is still much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with &#34;Things Can Only Get Better&#34; finishing with 2006 and the Fact that we are still waiting! with that promise from a Government that is full of sleaze.&#39;,
   &#34;Slasher films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and frankly unoriginal. I happen to to be a horror movie fan, but this film was just so poor, words fail me. The script is severely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting astoundingly bad. Just an all round stinker, that I wasted time of my life on. This had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who greenlit this mess?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer&#39;s mask - which was nice. The second was the Austrailian affinity with humourous profanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself, and avoid this hideous mess.&#34;,
   &#39;Depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this, &#34;Christmas Evil&#34; can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lame holiday-themed slashers ever made. Me, personally, I\&#39;m tempted to opt for the latter because I didn\&#39;t bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early 80\&#39;s slasher with a nutcase in a Santa Clause costume butchering people. Wrong! The movie actually handles about a bloke named Harry Stadling; who\&#39;s obsessed with Christmas, works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment. Harry\&#39;s issues all started when he witnessed Santa \x96 his daddy in a costume obviously \x96 caress his mommy\&#39;s naked legs at a tenderly young age. After that he just developed into a social outcast, much to the irritation of his younger brother, who\&#39;s bound to snap one (holi)day. I fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie, but did it really have to be so boring? There are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed, but this movie doesn\&#39;t even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists (with the notable exception of the finale, I must admit). Also, I would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children! He doesn\&#39;t and exclusively kills misbehaving adults. How are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original Christmas thriller serious when Santa doesn\&#39;t even commit one miserable child murder? THAT would have made &#34;Christmas Evil&#34; a classic, whereas now it\&#39;s just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk.&#39;,
   &#34;Warning: Spoilers Galore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh, that&#39;s right, some idiot already did that - I rest my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he&#39;s not that smart from the outset. Marky Mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship a-bustle with genetic experiments on apes. Must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marky&#39;s chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci-fi cinema - the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the space station&#39;s mind-boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep-space rescue mission into a worm-hole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before anyone can say `Pointless Remake&#39; Marky has surfed the worm-hole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it weren&#39;t for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise! It&#39;s APES doing the chasing - or at least, it *would* have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTY-THREE YEARS AGO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncan&#39;s gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing *his* lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka irritating chimp activist), at a loss without a Shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes `re-imagining&#39;: `The Apes Of Roth&#39;. While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as Chimpanzee Thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: Thade is mad when we first meet him... and he&#39;s pretty much at the same level of mad at film&#39;s end. Nice twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original POTA (1968) featured a leading character, Charlton Heston&#39;s Taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets - yet as that film progressed, Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind&#39;s worth - as their sole champion! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed. Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Mark&#39;s Leo? Or Roth&#39;s Thade? No, but there&#39;s lots of running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slogans cry: Take Back The Planet .but it&#39;s the APES&#39; planet. In this movie, humans and apes crash-landed here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators, simply because they&#39;re there. `Taking it back&#39; is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, `A planet where men evolved from APES??!!&#39; and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he WAS Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience&#39;s expectations: how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot command respect? Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it&#39;s like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanity&#39;s icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant. In the original film, the apes deem Taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity. That irony again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was apt that a man who elevated scene-chewing to an acting technique - Heston - should play the father of this film&#39;s primo scene-chewer, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth&#39;s ape-dad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the HUMANS this time, `Damn them! Damn them all to hell!&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky an ass-beating lesson, a pod descends from on high with Marky&#39;s chimpnaut in it. Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, `Let&#39;s teach these monkeys about evolution.&#39; Firstly, they&#39;re not monkeys, you ape! Secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren&#39;s half-nekkid role was actually integral to the plot (be still my pants.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter that he was humankind&#39;s last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating, `It&#39;s a madhouse! A MADHOUSE!!...&#39;&#34;,
   &#39;To be honest, i\&#39;m surprised by the positive votes that this film has received. The movie just drags along its 81 minute life span, and the audience has to suffer the whole way through. Actually there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well. Scott Valentine(Merrideth\&#39;s boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough watch. I guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies....give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day(to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in &#34;Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4&#34;). The movie moves so slow and is only positively punctuated by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling\&#39;s dance scenes. This movie can honestly only be recommended to the die hard fans of Charlie Spradling (which i am, and i still had a rough time watching it!).&#39;,
   &#39;I could name plenty of funny movies. There are comedies that set out to be funny, and are. Some movies, like a Gymkata for example, try to be serious but end up funny. The Ladies Man is a film that is desperately trying to be funny, but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust. It\&#39;s anti-funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t think I laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie. It\&#39;s simply unfunny. It\&#39;s boring, stupid, inane, annoying, mind-bogglingly bad, but not funny. I don\&#39;t particularly care for Tim Meadows, or this character from SNL, but I expected better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is completely lacking logic or common sense. It\&#39;s like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was typing and he couldn\&#39;t see which keys he was hitting. They tell the &#34;origin&#34; of the Ladies Man, but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like it\&#39;s still the seventies. The movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to pleasuring himself to porn, shortly after he tried to hang himself. This is comedy? I like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor (Spending a lot of time writing comedy as I do), but maybe I\&#39;m just not quite bright enough for this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee Evans, so funny as Tucker in There\&#39;s Something About Mary, is outrageously bad here. I was pleading with him in my head to shut up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end I was pounding on my chair, muttering under my breath, and had the film gone on any longer, would probably have attempted suicide. This film might not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it\&#39;s the first movie I\&#39;ve seen that\&#39;s come close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity don&#39;t exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn&#39;t social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And this is why this film is truly despicable.&#34;,
   &#39;I personally hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotypical ,and the whole idea was a rip off of &#34;The Cutting Edge&#34;, and &#34;Cadet Kelly&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character is a snotty girl who gets shipped of to a place where she doesn\&#39;t belong. The whole place hates her, and to make things worse there is a hot guy that seemingly doesn\&#39;t like her ( well duh the whole damn school can\&#39;t stand you). Amazingly she finds a way to fit in and make everyone to like her plus, gets the guy to fall head over heels in love with her. Then comes the choice, where she must choose between figure skating and hockey. She chooses hockey then she goes to the figure skating nationals,and gets to be on the Olympic team. No real surprise there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole movie was so damn predictable You knew what was going to happen before you even saw it. This was so awful I nearly puked, and by the time I was finished watching it, I had an awful headache and the urge to shoot myself for watching such crap. Don\&#39;t watch this unless you are under ten, or actually like crappy tween movies.&#39;,
   &#34;This was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, itself brilliant, but not this. Nowhere did I see Mel Brook&#39;s name on here and I can guess why, he&#39;s got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. My gawd, who would find this funny. Sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn&#39;t funny, well cause it&#39;s simply not funny. It&#39;s like the writers didn&#39;t even try to be funny, just to cash in on being tied with Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out, they didn&#39;t care. It was a quick cash cow which thank god didn&#39;t cash out. I guess it&#39;s useful for historical purposes only, or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative Hollywood writers can be.&#34;,
   &#34;Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable. . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother, aided, abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget. The very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger whom I do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade. Also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads. I thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all. The movie I kept surfing back and forth to, had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much. Unless you like an unbelievable story, wooden acting, a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one. Oh and maybe a small carping criticism, but wouldn&#39;t a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this movie is the scenery&#34;,
   &#39;When a film has no fewer than FIVE different titles, it usually means several things and almost always means that the film has major flaws somewhere. Necromancy has major flaws and is just out and out bad. I saw the version on video called Rosemary\&#39;s Disciples. Yes, I am sure it differs from other versions, but I am not inclined to think that in any way is any other version and the few more minutes it might have - going to be really any better. The story is perhaps the biggest problem: the film opens with Laurie waking up and her husband taking her to a town where he has a new job at a toy factory for occultists(yep, it gets bad this early!). The town is called Lillith and has some guy with a rifle on the bridge to make sure only those selected by the &#34;owner&#34; of the town are allowed in. Soon we find that everyone living in Lillith is a witch and all follow the directives of Mr. Cato - the head of this municipal coven who wants his dead son back(hence the name Necromancy). The people in the town do witch kind of stuff - have ceremonies, some like wearing a goat\&#39;s head, and promiscuity abounds(not much really shown in this area), but none of these people are very good actors. Mr. Cato is played robustly by the figuratively and literally larger-than-life movie maverick Orson Welles. Welles is misused, but, make no mistake, he is the best thing in this movie. And that is really the saddest part of Necromancy as Welles gives a pretty poor and pedestrian performance with little directorial guidance. In one scene at a party, director Bert I Gordon keeps going back to Welles watching the action of the party using the exact same frames! It looked ridiculous. As did the scene that was repeatedly seen over and over again of a woman\&#39;s arm centered in swirling flames after a car crash. It looked like the arm of a shop mannequin. The story is never fully utilized as we never really know what happens: many scenes are shot like dreams or hallucinations and never confirmed. This also applies to the corny, hokey ending. The lead Pamela Franklin is pert and pretty and has some talent. Other than her performance, real slim pickings from the rest of the cast sans Welles. The direction and story were both done by Gordon who obviously had little gas left in the engine. This is not a good movie in any way under any name.&#39;,
   &#39;A still famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not filmed for four years. When he is invited to participate in a new project, he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket. He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he becomes attracted with her ability. His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor. But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. However, the pointless &#34;10 Items or Less&#34; is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget movie does not seem to have a storyline, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again. Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family? Or was a clash of classes, and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes? My vote is four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Um Astro em Minha Vida&#34; (&#34;A Star in My Life&#34;)&#39;,
   &#34;I picked this DVD up at the Dollar Store. The DVD was on the 2 for $1 rack, but since it had Michael Madsen in it, I thought that since I had never seen the movie, I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I didn&#39;t like the movie. The movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found that the director&#39;s use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me. I would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#39;t throw it away like one of the other commentators, but It may be quite awhile before I would consider watching this movie again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows, since it was Michael Madsen&#39;s film debut, maybe it might have some archival value at some future date.&#34;,
   &#34;My commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film. In fact, they&#39;re quite congruent with mine. What gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie, it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn&#39;t the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. A silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar, slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to Young song to the heroine, who is unaware of what&#39;s taken place. Somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the West Coast in search of????? Sorry Neal, stick with music and leave film making to Steven Stills.&#34;,
   &#34;I am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has. Haven&#39;t said that Friends was, at best an &#39;average&#39; sitcom, and not as great as others have made out. Let&#39;s face it, if it wasn&#39;t for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would&#39;ve lasted as long as it has done. I very much doubt that. Although as the series progressed, Friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I couldn&#39;t care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight, nor of who was sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when it had all these A-list Hollywood actors from the movie world, I still didn&#39;t bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending, well it was predictable to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good. The show should&#39;ve came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series waned, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way round. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon. And yet, I for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever.&#34;,
   &#34;Redundant, but again the case. If you enjoy the former SNL comedian and his antics (in this case, Schneider), then you should go. Basic comedy\x85.man&#39;s life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him. Unfortunately, he takes on each animal&#39;s characteristics. Former Survivor Colleen looks pretty good here, now that she doesn&#39;t have open sores on her legs, and a little makeup on her face! D&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;m grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent!!! Yay!!! This programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and &#39;Brand f*cking Beckham&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I used to really like &#39;Posh and Becks&#39;, I still very much admire David&#39;s talent, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has his wife&#39;s hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was clear the hand of Victoria was all over Beckham&#39;s premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened at Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds - he&#39;s sold his soul for the American Buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from Division One in England (no offence America - but at Baseball and Basketball you rule - football you don&#39;t!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - I digress. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve seen such an over-the-top, entirely false performance from &#39;Posh&#39; - this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the Rebecca Loos &#39;debacle&#39;, when instead of throwing all the cr*p at David he deserved, she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money-spinner her marriage has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole PR stunt was pathetic. Why can&#39;t she just go over there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down? When did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to America should be shrouded by this huge fan fare? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I saw the David Beckham documentary last night. At least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do with learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing Victoria - you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps. Little hint - stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck America!!&#34;,
   &#34;I blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that I paid as much as I did but I would say that it&#39;s at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting. It is not a good movie in any way but I must say that I was pretty darn entertained. I guess it could be called so-bad-it&#39;s-good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the acting is awful, I feel like I could have done a better job showing, at least, any emotion. The story is nothing new and has been done better. I guess I just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type film. I would say rent this or download it but definitely don&#39;t buy it. It is not worth more than one watch.&#34;,
   &#39;The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into &#34;horizon blue&#34; and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right.&#39;,
   &#34;To describe this film as garbage is unfair. At least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby. This flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Bacon can act superbly given the chance, so no doubt had an IRS bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay. The mad scientist story of &#39;Hollow Man&#39; has been told before, been told better, and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies. In the UK they were marketed as &#39;The Transparent Man (/Woman/Dog)&#39; which is maybe where they got the title for this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clever special effects, dire script, non-existent plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;Inept, boring, and incoherent supernatural &#34;thriller&#34; in which college student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t begin to tell you how bad this is...nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value. I did not like this cast in this particular film - they are all sadly unconvincing (then again, their roles are no good). To promote this as a horror film is a joke. Where are the scares? There\&#39;s no sense or suspense - there are a few good songs but that\&#39;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How on Earth did this project get the green light? Writer-director Steve Carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that I can sense. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alleged &#34;killer cut&#34; that I watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10&#39;,
   &#39;The first (and only) time I saw &#34;Shades&#34; was during a Sneakpreview. It hadn\&#39;t even been in premiere. I remember there was someone of the directors staff there, don\&#39;t even remember who. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he\&#39;s stands miles ahead all the rest. He plays an actor who\&#39;s star has long stopped rising. He\&#39;s helping to realise a movie in Belgium entitled &#34;Shades&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the movie started, we noticed how much swearing there is. Nothing against the occasional swear word. However this was way beyond annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the F*** word to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone from the cast, a non-English speaker uses the F**** or S*** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We quickly lost count of how many times they used the F and S words. Everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre. And we had to give a vote, but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10, and we were looking for the -10.&#39;,
   &#39;Documentary about nomadic Persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass. Watching this silent, black and white feature, marred in part by a twink-twink-twink Oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition, is even duller than it sounds. The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen, and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but despised this movie, notwithstanding the similarity of the theme. Physical hardships alone are just not that interesting.&#39;,
   &#39;Even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it\&#39;s still an awful film. If one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke.....first off, Jeroen Krabbé is i guess the poor man\&#39;s Gerard Depardieu.....naturally i hate Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny in the \&#39;Iron Mask\&#39; three musketeer one. Otherwise to me he is box office poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. The poor man\&#39;s box office poison....really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised. If the \&#39;4th Man\&#39; is supposed to be some sort of critique of the Bourgeoisie....what am i saying? it isn\&#39;t. Let\&#39;s just say hypothetically, if it was supposed to be, it wasn\&#39;t sharp enough. Satire is a tricky thing....if it isn\&#39;t sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead......i think that is what happened. The story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either.....(for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any Luis Bunuel film....very sharp satire)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[potential spoiler alert]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the blow job in the cemetery that Jeroen Krabbé\&#39;s character works so so hard to attain.... do you even care? is it funny? since Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control.....though i\&#39;m guessing he didn\&#39;t cast Jeroen Krabbé because he\&#39;s the worst actor and every character he\&#39;s played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass.... except he\&#39;s incompetent at it. So it becomes like a weird caricature. Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that on purpose? and Jeroen Krabbé is the butt of the joke as well? I just don\&#39;t see it...... So you understand the dilemma i\&#39;m faced with here right? It is the worst film ever because he\&#39;s supposed to be a good director. So there is some kind of dupery involved. I knew \&#39;Patch Adams\&#39; was horrible without even seeing it. Do not be duped by \&#39;The 4th Man&#34;s deceptively alluring packaging or mr. Voerhoven\&#39;s reputation as a good director etc. etc.&#39;,
   &#39;Words can\&#39;t simply describe how awful this film is. I watched it on video last night, and I simply could not believe what I was seeing. Basically, &#34;Snakeeater&#34; is about an ex-military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by Deliverance-style Rednecks. The film\&#39;s acting, writing, direction, photography, and editing are deplorable along with a song called &#34;Soldier&#34; that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is one treat. &#34;Horshack&#34; (Ron Pallio) from &#34;Welcome Back Carter&#34; is in the film playing a laughable bad guy. Otherwise, please avoid this mess at ALL COSTS.&#39;,
   &#34;First off, I must admit that both films I&#39;ve seen by this director I saw without titles and so may have missed the points. My Czech isn&#39;t bad but, having sat through two of his films, I wish I hadn&#39;t even tried to learn. Samotari is too cool. Way too cool. It&#39;s about ten different story lines that weave in and out together. That&#39;s not so deeply unusual in a town the size of Prague (tiny, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30. They&#39;ve got jobs and only one studies. The best character is the young Balkan girl. Her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day. That&#39;s about it. The only great character. Everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own. How can I sympathise with such obvious incompetence? Perhaps there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists but do I need another stereotype in film? If you like alright music, see this film. If you want to laugh at others&#39; stupidity, see this film. If you like irony and dry humor, see an original Jarmusch not an imitation. And under NO circumstances see Ondricek&#39;s film, Septej (Whisper.) That is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes.&#34;,
   &#34;This is one very dire production. The general consensus has always been that while Princess Margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the production&#39;s weakest point, the actress failed to get that across. It also appeared that the production budget couldn&#39;t stretch to a hairdresser - from the outset, the hair on the Princess Margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush. The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was farcical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The production was a flaw ridden, cliché ridden, embarrassing load of rubbish. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!&#34;,
   &#39;This appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988. It looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier, and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture. I weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this.&#39;,
   &#39;Even thought I\&#39;m not the biggest of Cher fans, this movie was her crowning achievement. Granted, there were long term side-effects and risks of brain damage, memory loss (and) intellectual impairment, upon the screening such a film. A 1989 survey of Moonstruck fans by the UK Advocacy Network revealed that one-third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed Moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cher plays someone very un-Cher in this movie, a dowdy young widow named Loretta living in New York with her extended family. They\&#39;re anti-American, pro-Italian and always at each other in someway. She has been going out with Johnny Camarary for a while, a nice mamma\&#39;s boy man, and he asks her to marry him. She says yes. I loved her mom\&#39;s questions: &#34;Do you love him Loretta?&#34;, &#34;No.&#34;, &#34;Good. If you love him he\&#39;ll drive you crazy because they know they can. But you like him then?&#34;, &#34;Oh yeah, he\&#39;s a sweet man Ma&#34;. When Johnny goes off to Sicily to care for his dying mother, he asks that Loretta make contact with his brother who he\&#39;s been estranged from for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This victory for human rights carries even greater significance, as Sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment. In 1938, Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti, saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs, easing the job of slitting their throats. Cerletti was inspired, and began experimenting with electroshock on humans, developing the first Electroshock machine. Broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was,in so many ways, an anti-American movie. It\&#39;s about love, to be sure, but it\&#39;s also about infidelity, secrets, lonely people, and strange behavior brought on by American policies. The characters, from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant, the aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters. It\&#39;s somewhat of a chick flick, as it\&#39;s how Loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp. It\&#39;s a Cinderella story in many ways, and that is every little girl\&#39;s dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming free and fully informed Consent, it is well to reaffirm the individual\&#39;s right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses. But we might ask ourselves whether we, as fans of cinema, though in no way sworn to any Hippocratic Oath, should be offering it.&#39;,
   &#34;While watching the film, I&#39;m not sure what direstion it was to take. There&#39;s a reason a writer shouldn&#39;t direct his work and even act in it as well, you can&#39;t do it all. I felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats. Ms. McTeer is the film. To add to her amazing talents, her portrayal of this woman was why I was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my view, conflict is what makes drama and a great story. I felt this film didn&#39;t have that. Everything was somewhat easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted. Watch the film for the sweetness, but most of all for Ms. McTeer&#39;s brilliant performance.&#34;,
   &#34;I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed. I didn&#39;t feel anything in this film. I felt sick because the gore alone was shocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film. Haven&#39;t we seen this all before? I didn&#39;t like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him. But then again I couldn&#39;t think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep? So many questions need to be answered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad film, not a good one. judge for yourself.&#34;,
   &#39;I had no background knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded cool and I\&#39;ve been wanting to see a really kick-butt Viking movie for awhile now... alas, this film was not what I was looking for. I had hoped for the best, but instead, was delivered a boring Nordic soap-opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time. The film\&#39;s premise is intriguing enough: It\&#39;s about a Viking warlord who defies his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord\&#39;s son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as a Berserker. This Barek guy is then forced to live enraged, insane, and violent lifetime after lifetime. The movie is filmed competently enough, with some rich cinematography and quasi-good performances by the actors, but again, I found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end. The filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi-unique but they dropped the ball. Perhaps it could\&#39;ve been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore... I mean, we are talking about &#34;Berserkers&#34; here, aren\&#39;t we? Vikings were supposed to be BAD enough, what with all the raping and pillaging, so aren\&#39;t Berserkers supposed to be even more extreme? All in all, unless you\&#39;re a fan of The Young and Restless (etc...) or, are yourself, in fact, an insane Berserker who likes self torture, I\&#39;d probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid.&#39;,
   &#34;Really, everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else! No wonder, the casting is done not with the left hand, but rather not at all. I haven&#39;t seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone impersonating some sort of agent, carrying a gun. You don&#39;t use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role. The only worse thing I can imagine is casting Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is likewise awful, possibly with Hurt as the sole exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but suffering. Oh, did I mention that it is a completely insane story? Jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10, because the photography could be worse.&#34;,
   &#34;Okay, if you&#39;ve seen The Ring, you&#39;ve basically seen The Grudge. It&#39;s trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds, but it fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes, for instance, how would the care center have known that Yoko didn&#39;t show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there? And it&#39;s not really clear what Bill Pullman&#39;s character had to do with anything. He just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It didn&#39;t make a lot of sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, the little boy or the dad? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it more.&#34;,
   &#34;Take one look at the cover of this movie, and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film. This is cheese filmmaking in every respect, but it does have its moments. Despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives, the story is actually interesting at some points, although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads&#39; shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality-free boyfriends. The acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot, which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience&#39;s attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In The Nutty Professor, a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer, whereas in The Invisible Maniac, a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible, allowing him to spy on (and kill, for some reason) his students. Boring fodder. Don&#39;t expect any kind of mental stimulation from this, and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick...&#34;,
   &#39;I never was an avid viewer of &#34;Crocodile Hunter&#34;, but did occasionally see an episode, or a bit of an episode, and when the news spread about Steve Irwin\&#39;s death from a stingray attack in 2006, it certainly caught my attention. This movie, with Steve and his wife, Terri, playing themselves, but in a fictional story, was released in 2002, but I didn\&#39;t hear of it until several years later, and even after that, it took me a while to get around to seeing it. Well, now I have seen it, and after looking here first (more than once), and seeing its rating, I was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be, though it could have been a BIT better. Apparently, it\&#39;s supposed to be a comedy, so a major problem with it is that it isn\&#39;t very funny at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A U.S. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in Australia, where it is swallowed by a crocodile! While Steve and Terri Irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy Brozzie Drewitt, and are unaware of what\&#39;s inside it, two CIA agents are sent to Australia to retrieve the beacon! The agents are assisted by Jo Buckley, and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them! On Steve and Terri\&#39;s mission, they face other types of dangerous wildlife, not just the crocodile, and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it, when Steve sees the CIA agents after them, he mistakes them for poachers! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I not laugh once while watching this film, the only part that really made me smile was Steve Irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the CIA agents. Apart from that, I don\&#39;t think I found anything even mildly amusing. It\&#39;s also a bit of an incoherent mess, switching back and forth from the Australian Outback to the CIA headquarters, and it seems like clips from &#34;Crocodile Hunter&#34; and clips from an action thriller (or something like that) put together for some reason. Also added to that mix are the ranch scenes, which also seem to be from somewhere else, and as funny as Brozzie Drewitt, played by Magda Szubanski, is supposed to be, she\&#39;s not. At one point, we see her farting, so we have a fart joke, a MAJOR cliché in modern comedy! Are they SO hard to resist?! I also found the typical &#34;Crocodile Hunter&#34; scenes, with Steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers, to be tedious, but I guess the fact that I was never a devout fan of the show didn\&#39;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Irwin was admired by many as a conservationist, and is sadly missed by them, while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him. No matter which side you\&#39;re on, &#34;The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course&#34; is not a well crafted movie. I\&#39;m sure it does help if you\&#39;re a big Steve Irwin fan, but even if you are, there\&#39;s no guarantee that you would like this movie, as some fans clearly haven\&#39;t been impressed. In fact, it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than I have, so maybe it WON\&#39;T help. Like I said, there\&#39;s no guarantee. I would say whatever you may think of Steve Irwin and his show, this movie was unnecessary. The attempt to combine what is usually seen in &#34;Crocodile Hunter&#34; with a fictional story unfortunately failed, and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes!&#39;,
   &#34;This adaptation, like 1949&#39;s *The Heiress*, is based on the Henry James novel. *The Heiress*, starring Olivia de Havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to James&#39; original story than this new remake, which retains James&#39; original title. It is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter (Leigh), devoted to her father (Finney) after her mother dies during childbirth. The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. When a young man (Chaplin) of good family and little fortune comes courting, the Father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress \x96 most either love her or hate her \x96 and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she&#39;s acting through gritted teeth. She&#39;s not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly \x96 it&#39;s just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. While the character garners a lot of sympathy, she&#39;s not particularly likable. The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin (previously seen in *The Truth About Cats and Dogs*) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. Finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? This is only one instance where *Washington Square* differs from *The Heiress*. Another instance is the ability to stick with it. It is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet, offering too little story in too long of a movie.&#34;,
   &#39;I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them. I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a youngster at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The entire world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings-on each day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moon liftoff, all the way to splashdown, in a multitude of languages. In school, some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on TV. During Apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate. You couldn\&#39;t go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was. The world was truly one community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down. We are left with our history books, and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to &#34;prove&#34; it with a bunch of lies and made-up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise--not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days.&#39;,
   &#34;Most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. Their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. Steven Greenstreet&#39;s documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population. As is usual, the people who scream the most get the most media attention. Other than its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set, the documentary was well made. My only dispute is that the feelings and uproar depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints, but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals.&#34;,
   &#34;I am not saying that Night of the Twisters was horrible, but it was far from great. Mediocre at absolute best. I seems though that every time one type of movie is released, a second must be around the same time. (Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante&#39;s Peak) Night of the Twisters is really just Twister except worse and with mundane special effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing against the actors who starred in it, even if they weren&#39;t great, it was the movie itself, the directing, the special effects, the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#39;t know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other, but this one would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.&#34;,
   &#39;I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time, after seeing &#34;Return to Paradise,&#34; which I found to be gritty. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which I think was partly stolen from &#34;Return to Paradise.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I was expecting too much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I didnt like Danes\&#39;s character and first and found her very annoying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt see anything realistic about the film. It could of been done so much better, for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror. It was too cheery a movie to be realistic. There could also of been more action and tension&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this film is the &#34;tragic&#34; ending. I couldnt of predicted that. But by that time I really didnt care what happened to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#39;,
   &#34;Definitely not worth the rental, but if you catch it on cable, you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos--Iman&#39;s appearance is especially self-deprecating. It&#39;s also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from The Sopranos typecast themselves.&#34;,
   &#34;Sure, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we in fact enjoy them, This however, wasn&#39;t even a guilty pleasure, it was just crap. Some guy, vince offer, who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk/high--probably both--and thought it was a great idea to make a movie. He then proceeded to show his script to equally high/drunk individuals. Overall, this movie was so bad, predictable, and unoriginal I couldn&#39;t get through 20 minutes of it before I turned it off. It makes You Got Served look like Citizen Kane. Bat Man? WTF...Some guy that walks around with a bat, real original. Almost as good as calling him Fat Man, and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit.&#34;,
   &#39;Never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent. Let\&#39;s see: FIRST, they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread. NEXT, they encourage as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget. And FINALLY, when the film hits the theaters, get as many said Christians as possible to see it yet again, bus them into the multiplexes if necessary, NOT on the merits of the film itself, but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THAT, of course, won\&#39;t be enough. I imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give &#34;Left Behind&#34; anything short of a glowing review will be deemed &#34;anti-Christian.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn\&#39;t surprise anyone. It is, after all, good old fashioned Capitalism at work. What DOES surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole &#34;Left Behind&#34; mindset. As someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality, it leaves me scratching my head. It would appear that there are many, MANY people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a &#34;Rapture&#34; is going to occur, and that millions of people all over the Earth are going to simultaneously vanish INTO THIN AIR. What kind of reality, I wonder, are these people living in? Is this &#34;Rapture&#34; something they actually believe in, or is it something they fervently WANT to believe in? And when they reach the end of their lives and realize this &#34;Rapture&#34; has not occurred, will they be disappointed and disillusioned? Will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the &#34;Rapture&#34; is imminent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a way, I almost wish that such an event would occur! What an interesting day that would be! What would be even more interesting is if the Apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion, not in the anthropological sense the authors of the &#34;Left Behind&#34; series have portrayed, but as more of a Stephen Spielberg production, with boiling clouds, trumpets, angels descending out of the sky, Moon turned to blood, the whole nine yards. Imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true, just as the evangelists had been warning for years, and that there was something more awesome than just the cold, hard, physical reality we inhabit. Wouldn\&#39;t THAT be something???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet in the final analysis, it\&#39;s that cold, hard, physical reality that I will content myself with. My life is not so meaningless that I need the fear of a &#34;Rapture&#34; and the &#34;End Times&#34; to make sense of it all ... nor do I need Heaven or Hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently, thank you very much.&#39;,
   &#34;It was all over with the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of those older movies. The Brain is well done, the script reminded me of Videodrome but then in a more cheesy way as said before. The acting can go through with it. But it&#39;s the effects that makes you laugh, the so called Brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching, the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street, remember the telephone coming alive.... Some how you keep watching this flick, waiting what is happening next. It&#39;s viewable for all freaks out there cause there isn&#39;t any gore in it and as said the blood isn&#39;t there neither but there is nudity for the perverts. I have seen worser movies than this one, only wished they had made it bloodier...&#34;,
   &#39;The plot for Descent, if it actually can be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. One near the beginning - one at the end. Together these events make up maybe 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean _everything_) in between is basically the director\&#39;s desperate effort to fill in the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I don\&#39;t get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy/dark (literally) scenes with NO storyline you have another thing coming. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. And no, she doesn\&#39;t get naked, not even in the NC-17 version, which I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch &#34;Descent&#34;, take a nap instead - you\&#39;ll probably have more interesting dreams.&#39;,
   &#34;This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen, as it&#39;s absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away!. The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn&#39;t so damn boring, and there isn&#39;t one character to root for either, plus I hope it makes it&#39;s way to the bottom 100, because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up at the end, it&#39;s a pretty good scene but it&#39;s already way too late, and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks, plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee&#39;s, as it was rather gory. I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion, plus it&#39;s lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window!. This is one of the most boring Horror films I have ever seen, as It&#39;s absolutely god awful, John Carradine has very limited screen time, and I say avoid it like the plague!, you don&#39;t want to go through the torture. The Direction is absolutely terrible!. Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible! job here, making every thing look cheap, wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace. The Acting is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but other then that he&#39;s hardly in the film other then flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled!!). Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura, as she didn&#39;t convince me at all. Ivy Bethune is OK, and somewhat creepy, but also overacted, she did have a creepy smile at the end though. Rest of the cast, I didn&#39;t pay enough attention too, as I had a lot of trouble getting through it, but they were all really bad. Overall please avoid this,It&#39;s not worth the agony!. BOMB out of 5&#34;,
   &#34;From the opening dialog and scenes, I knew I knew I was in for a train wreck. Didn&#39;t want to look, but couldn&#39;t turn away. If it weren&#39;t for the meer eye candy of this film, I would have given one star. The fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched, added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film. But this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were stuck out in the woods, your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease, other friends dying around you, stranded in a strange place, what would you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. B.) Have sex with your friends girlfriend. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs. D.) Bash in the head your childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel. E.) All of the above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Eli Roth, none of these answers are that far fetched. In fact, all are plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store. Stay away. Stay far away.&#34;,
   &#39;I didn\&#39;t know much about this movie before I watched it, but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics so I was interested. What I didn\&#39;t know is that this is NOT ACTUALLY A STORY but a bunch of New-Age blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say it belongs more in the Documentary category than Comedy or Drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marlee Matlin is in the movie, in order to give this New Age symposium *some* sort of a storyline. Her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speaker\&#39;s thoughts so we won\&#39;t die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie that crashes on her couch. We get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all &#34;means&#34; to them. The one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from India (I assume), but I think he showed up for the wrong film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like Barbara Eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs. It looks like Quark from DS9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film. There is a lot of whizbang CGI we\&#39;re supposed to be impressed with; cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds, because the filmmakers have apparently seen Flubber one too many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People in the movie say that the Arawak people on San Salvador thought Columbus\&#39;s ship the Pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before, as if people today had any way possible way of knowing. Of course they leave out all of that information and just say &#34;Columbus\&#39;s ships were invisible to the Indians in America.&#34; The film takes many such arrogant leaps. Thomas Young did a double-slit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time, and a wave some of the time. Of course you\&#39;d never *know* this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that &#34;atoms can be particles and waves.&#34; And that must mean that people can pass through walls, walk on water, and never grow old if they just wish upon a star!! Then I\&#39;m sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she just *believed* hard enough. I\&#39;m being sarcastic, but this film is chock-full of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them don\&#39;t really hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are New Age kooks who have grabbed onto Quantum Theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, etc. If these snake-oil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling, couldn\&#39;t they just *wish* their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film? We get to listen to another nameless man, with no credentials that we know of, talk on his couch in front of a fireplace (or TV screen) about how he creates his own life. Every time he was on the screen I wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face. These people take themselves WAY too seriously. Some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever *really* touches anything because there\&#39;s a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level. If only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach, screaming &#34;I\&#39;m not touching you! I\&#39;m not touching you!&#34; A moral relativist in the movie claims that there\&#39;s really &#34;no such thing as good or bad.&#34; So apparently it\&#39;s OK that Hitler gassed millions of Jews to death? Another person says that there is &#34;no such thing as love.&#34; It\&#39;s just a chemical and that we really don\&#39;t love people, we\&#39;re just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we\&#39;re around them. I suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception, seeing everything like RoboCop. They evaluate if women are cows, dogs, or foxes, and a sexual position pops onto the scree. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she\&#39;s supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she\&#39;s a beautiful and unique snowflake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked when the film said people often find evidence for their pre-conceived notions. Perhaps in this review I\&#39;m only seeing what I want to see, but I TRULY wanted to see these people get pies to the face, and it never happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;ve never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all of the ideas here. If you want to watch a good movie that talks about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, go see The Man Who Wasn\&#39;t There. If you want to read a good book about Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals, see Waking Life (although it can feel boring, self-important, and pretentious at times). All in all, you should go and read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10, but this one was a very easy for me: 1/10 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie\&#39;s title is true. The people in this film don\&#39;t know #$*! Hands down, the worst movie I\&#39;ve ever seen.&#39;,
   &#39;We see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl, but whatever he tries they won\&#39;t stay open. After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret, but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways. Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group, but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences. So, is she back from the grave seeking revenge? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh what a great and always spooky story! Well, that\&#39;s what I hoping I could say. And \&#39;hoping\&#39; was as good as it got. This is an forgettable, so-so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before, but I went in thinking it was my first viewing. So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things, but like I said it\&#39;s quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again. &#34;Nightmare\&#39; is just another type of it\&#39;s field that adds a \&#39;few\&#39; changes to the gruel. Oh, please give me something that\&#39;s a bit more fresh. It doesn\&#39;t have to be entirely original, but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J-horror flick. Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right\x85 an evil looking, vengeful chick spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old, same old story and jolts. This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals. The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality. While, the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it\&#39;s murky lighting. The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood-curdling experience, but really when it\&#39;s not trying to shock you. I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut-eye. That might be harsh, but it just didn\&#39;t go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments. You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one, the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self-centred bunch that you don\&#39;t really care what happens to them. The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship. It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it\&#39;s just plain ludicrous. The film\&#39;s haunting ending is a high point, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film looks fine, although it could have done without the snazzy, quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood. The performances tread a fine line, but Gyu-ri Kim is strong in the lead role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas, but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills. Although, I found the handling of it rather lethargic, despite the odd effective chills. A standard effort all round I guess, but still it\&#39;s equally missable.&#39;,
   &#39;After I got done watching this movie I was so upset that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. That\&#39;s 2 hours I\&#39;ll never get back. Ugh. When you start this you might think &#34;Wow this is really good!&#34; But rest assured that first impressions mean NOTHING. I was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending I have ever seen. This movie is simply pathetic. The acting is bland, the story line is anything but original and there\&#39;s nothing especially unique about this except that it\&#39;s the WORST MOVIE EVER!!! DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! WARNING!! DUMBEST MOVIE EVER YOU WILL BE SORRY IF YOU WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS!!! 1/10&#39;,
   &#34;how many minutes does it take to paint a poem? in this film much too long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the boys can&#39;t withhold touching each other and making love. after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt: exploration, fantasy, longing, lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music, close-ups and silent scenes like telling a poem. but it really takes too long, annoying long, shame, the effort was promising&#34;,
   &#34;First off there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message. So my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations. As a Christian, though an amillenialist, I believe there will be a great tribulation and I believe Christ will return as he said as much. So even though I have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why I rate this movie so low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, awful script, mediocre acting, and pitiful FX. This movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s. No, this movie ranks down there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this, but they failed. The Left Behind Series, The Apocalypse series, and the Omega Code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the FX problems and the dated look problem, but their scripts are still poor, and their acting is wooden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are great Christian films, with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. I&#39;m surprised the MST3K crew never lampooned this one.&#34;,
   &#34;An idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful. So, no new story lines here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid, disgusting film. If you enjoy watching kids vomiting, or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife&#39;s teeth out in a bloody horror-type, go see (or rent) the film. If not, move on to something else (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?)&#34;,
   &#34;This was one of the most boring movies I&#39;ve ever seen\x85 I don&#39;t really know why\x85 Just your run-of-the-mill stories about guy who is about to get married, and starts to fancy someone else instead. Story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t really know what was wrong with this film. Most of the time when these kinds of actors/actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before, it&#39;s really entertaining. There are usually little clever thing in them that aren&#39;t really in any other. For some reason, this one just doesn&#39;t hold your attention. You can pick out some funny parts, or clever ideas in it, but for some reason they&#39;re just not funny, nor clever in any way\x85 I wish I new how to explain it, but I don&#39;t\x85 Just don&#39;t waste your time on this one\x85&#34;,
   &#39;I actually had quite high hopes going into this movie, so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best. About 1/3 of the way through the film I simply had to give up, quite simply the movie is a mish-mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and it\&#39;s all disconnected. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t think it\&#39;s David Lynch-esquire as some would have you believe, it is nowhere near that realm other than some trippy visuals. Saying it\&#39;s artsy to disguise the fact there\&#39;s no apparent plot or story is just a manner or justifying why you wasted the 1.5 hours in the film. The acting was good, but that cannot save lack of story. I do agree with the one comment posted previously... &#34;it\&#39;s like being in some other person\&#39;s head... while they\&#39;re on drugs,&#34; in other words nothing makes sense.&#39;,
   &#34;This film has got several key flaws. The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! This sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life. This means that the film cannot captivate it&#39;s audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very BAD! Do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe, you&#39;ll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.&#34;,
   &#34;Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mob boss, leaving a mental institution, back to his world of gangsters. How can a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very gorgeous), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and a make such a waste of time? This movie is a comedy that is not funny, having a constellation in the cast. My vote is four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil):&#39; Prazer em Matar-te!&#39; (&#39;Pleasure in Killing You!&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Wood\&#39;s impassioned defense of cross-dressing in &#34;Glen or Glenda?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subject: playing bridge. The Park Avenue set plays it; the Bohemians play it. The Russians -- who speak very questionable &#34;Russian&#34; and have most unconvincing accents when they speak English -- play it at the restaurant where they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one isn\&#39;t interested in bridge, one -- even despite the great cast -- isn\&#39;t likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.&#39;,
   &#34;FLIGHT OF FURY takes the mantle of being the very WORST Steven Seagal flick I&#39;ve ever seen...Up to now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest, Seagal isn&#39;t really trying in this - he&#39;s fat and his voice is dubbed once more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Co-stars fare no better, being a rather sorry load of 3rd raters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Direction by Keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he&#39;s also responsible for another couple of Seagal stinkers (SHADOW MAN &amp; ATTACK FORCE) The screenplay Co-written by Seagal himself is laughably inept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to IMDb $12M was spent on this boring load of old tosh - If these figures are correct I sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for shot remake of the Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which has to be better than this tripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever,Give it a MISS! 1/2 * out of *****&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this on DVD ( It`s known as CORRUPT in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how Harvey Keitel`s character Frank is so much like the one he played BAD LIEUTENANT in &#34; This gritty and powerful police thriller &#34; . What the casing didn`t mention was that this is an old Italian movie . How old is it Theo ? Well when a character plays music he doesn`t put on the CD player , he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing , puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . You see my point about this being an old film ? The DVD case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . It`s also a film with poor production values like so many other Italian films masquerading as American ones . With the exception of Keitel the cast are awful though Johnny Rotten`s performance is bizarre rather than terrible , the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that I was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( I don`t know if it`s down to a dodgy DVD or if it`s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is Ennio Morricone`s score . It`s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for CORRUPT is the same one who did the music for those Clint Eastwood westerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this is a pity because CORRUPT does have its moments . It`s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always Keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . Just a pity the rest of the movie didn`t match up to his high standards&#39;,
   &#34;The trailers for this film were better than the movie. What waste of talent and money. Wish I would&#39;ve waited for this movie to come on DVD because at least I wouldn&#39;t be out $9. The movie totally misses the mark. What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors, turned out to be a B-movie at best. Movie moved VERY slow and just when I thought it was going somewhere, it almost did but then it didn&#39;t. In this day and age, we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film, and this film offered neither. The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good, however, not sure if it was the way it was directed, the lighting, the delivery of lines, the writing or what, but nothing came from it. Lot of hype for nothing. I was VERY disappointed in this film, and I&#39;m telling everyone NOT to see it. The cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well. And the ending had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film. What a disappointment.&#34;,
   &#34;This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen. It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps. The movie starts out bad (I would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1/10) and then it get progressively worse, minute by minute. The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety, long minutes. Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video. Somehow the video manages even to make cute, scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful. This movie is amazingly bad. I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over and with Buscemi&#39;s character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in your ear than to watch this movie. The sequels are not nearly as bad. If you have to rent a Troma film, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I would rather watch 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than to see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful, this is it.&#34;,
   &#34;I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock off, when watching it i got the chills, I even wet myself a little. When that Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord Asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time. Any way back on track Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being. Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas past. This movie is so bad I put my new born child in a box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox. He can raise my kid I&#39;m not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert Ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.&#34;,
   &#34;Contrary to another reviewer, I think that this is WELL-written, especially the more fictional it is, because greater imagination would be required; and well acted, because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen-minutes-plus, well-done monologues. But I&#39;m just not entertained by such solemn, pious rememberances. Everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everybody has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten, not-very-atypical stories and problems, exemplifying how anybody&#39;s life (or part of it) is fodder for film. Then again, I think poorly of TV&#39;s reality shows, too. So, if that&#39;s your bag, you may like this. It&#39;s the kind of stuff that would make for good &#39;phone and/or internet gossip; but absolutely without other-than-verbal action. And, although each of the speakers is female, I&#39;m gonna leave gender outta this.&#34;,
   &#34;I have been reading the reviews for this movie and now I wanna kill my self. I don&#39;t wanna live in a world where people find this move or Rob Schneider funny. What is wrong with these people. I&#39;m not angry at Rob Schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat. I watched this film in disbelief. Who would pay money to make this?? This film is so bad that its painful. Most bad films are funny because they are crap. The Animal is just DISGUSTING!!! Watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self. We don&#39;t need you. I want to raise money to get Rob Scheider off all movies. If someone killed Rob Schneider they should be given a Nobel peace prize.&#34;,
   &#39;Although there are a lot of familiar &#34;television&#34; names associated with &#34;A Man Called Sledge&#34;, there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960\&#39;s-70\&#39;s television series like &#34;The Rat Patrol&#34; is a bigger cast and a lot more violence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing (&#34;Maverick&#34;, &#34;Support Your Local Sheriff&#34;-&#34;Gunfighter&#34; etc.). Unfortunately his earthy likability works against him, as Sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of Clint Eastwood\&#39;s spaghetti western character. But Eastwood\&#39;s stuff was not this flat and uninteresting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that &#34;A Man Called Sledge&#34; could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub-genre. Fans of the slow-paced &#34;Combat&#34; television series will feel an instant connection as Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some then trendy slow-mo shots and cross-dissolves, which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story-telling purpose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is the standard &#34;big heist&#34; thing (insert &#34;The War Wagon&#34; here) with Sledge plotting how to heist a $300,000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of &#34;Alias Smith and Jones&#34; with the same plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer\&#39;s interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, what do I know? I\&#39;m only a child.&#39;,
   &#34;I can say nothing more about this movie than: Man, this SUCKS!!!!! If you really hate yourself and want to do some severe damage to your brain, watch this movie. It&#39;s the best cure in the world for taking away happiness. When I started watching this film, I was completely happy. Afterwords I could feel my brain melting, like it was struck by molten lava. God, I HATE that stupid Dinosaur. So if you want severe brain damage: Watch this movie, it will do the trick.&#34;,
   &#34;There have been some low moments in my life, when I have been bewildered and depressed. Sitting through Rancid Aluminium was one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warning signs were there. No premiere (even the stars didn&#39;t want to attend) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I sat through the film was in the hope that I might catch up on some sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing in the film was explained. The narration was idiotic. I cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot, then to my growing despair, it was revealed that he hadn&#39;t really been shot dampening my joy. I sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some positive aspects, mainly unintentional moments of humour. For example, the scene in which the main character, for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle, while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My words cannot explain the anger I feel, so I shall conclude thus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rancid Aluminium: for sadists, wastrels, and regressives only who want to torture themselves.&#34;,
   &#39;One of the lamer wedding movies you\&#39;ll see. Smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters. The ethnic stereotypes are like a Henny Youngman joke, except they just aint in the least bit funny here. Molly Ringwald, well what else needs to be said. Give you a clue to the silliness, she destroys a $10,000 wedding dress, because &#34;It just won\&#39;t be me&#34; makes it into this rag, with straps and puts on a top hat, and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy, rather than ringwalding her neck. Its a helluva a cast too, check out how heavy Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!&#39;,
   &#34;Sadly I don&#39;t remember the book anymore, but I do recall that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This Film represents a typical German Production of low quality. It does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good, it is just badly adabted. At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren&#39;t cannot rescue this poor spectacle. However there&#39;s hope ... I&#39;ve been told that the films following this one are getting better and better. So in conclusion I must say that this film doesn&#39;t deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.&#34;,
   &#39;I was p***ed when I couldn\&#39;t see this one when it was screening at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that it was going to be on cable tonight, I put it on remind as soon as I could. So was it worth the wait? Well let\&#39;s backtrack a tad as I have yet to give you the plot. Sean Crawley is a young man who doesn\&#39;t know what his path in life is. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray totally hammered asks Sean to off the guy that they had Sean following around. And it goes on from there. Which leads me back to the question posed. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the buildup was pretty good and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it\&#39;s nowhere near as violent as I was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped, but fumbled and taken in the other direction. I know where this point happened exactly, but can\&#39;t say without spoiling the film. But needless to say it happened. The ending doesn\&#39;t save the film either. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be good like &#34;Re-animator&#34; or &#34;Castle Freak&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows her ta-tas in one fantasy and then in the next more ta-tas and it pans down and...OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES!!!!!&#39;,
   &#34;I regret that I&#39;ve seen this movie. Can&#39;t believe that the creator of Best Intentions and Pelle the Conqueror could make such a bleak and boring film. What a waste!&#34;,
   &#34;There was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft. All his characters in this movie were so unlikable and I could care less. The best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause I felt so damn dirty that I wasted money on this stinking load. Hey genius....triads and yakuza are from two different places learn something about Asian culture. The dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless. This DVD does prove useful I do love my new coaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So kids don&#39;t waste your cash on this crap buy Hostel instead.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie was slower then Molasses in January... in Alaska. The man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview. I had to wake up the people I was watching it with, several times. After it was over, I felt bad for having woken them up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen, but nothing ever does. It was easy to loose track of people&#39;s motives, and the characters were flat and uninteristing. By the end of the movie, you just hoped everyone would died. Everyone runs around either being contemptible, petty, or pitiful, and usually all three. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And worse, we watched a minute or two of the added features, just for kicks and giggles you understand, and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are. If they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back, it might have been worth watching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was brought in expecting the excitement of &#39;24.&#39; I got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman.&#34;,
   &#34;Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez and it might be brilliant literature, this cinema-adaption really sucks as it&#39;s more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices. The story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight. I am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece, just perhaps that you can see Salma Hayek in here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that?

   &#34;Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve, (don&#39;t ask how) I may have been young, but I wasn&#39;t stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. I&#39;ve seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I&#39;ve seen better performances at a school play, And I&#39;ve seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer&#39;s life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.&#34;,
   &#39;I was expecting a little something from &#34;K-911&#34;, I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame\&#39;s movie, not Jerry Lee\&#39;s. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn\&#39;t have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn\&#39;t going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that\&#39;s pretty sad that they out shined the actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I\&#39;m glad it\&#39;s not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. Don\&#39;t you wish Ashlee Simpson would take that same advice? :D &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#39;,
   &#34;Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress of all the Law and Order ADA&#39;s and her acting is even worse here. Her attempts at a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. Nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child; at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed, as if she can&#39;t remember where she left her keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an important true story, so it&#39;s too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they just can&#39;t overcome Rohm&#39;s tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a Southern drawl whenever actual acting is required.&#34;,
   &#34;The pakage implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery, but that&#39;s not what I got out of it! I didn&#39;t get anything! In the first half there&#39;s a new character (without introduction) in every other scene. The first half-hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just one long, annoying, underlit chase scene. There&#39;s always an irritating sound in the background whether it&#39;s a loud watch ticking, a blaring siren, a train whistling, or even the horrible score by Quincy Jones. There are a lot of parts that are laughably bad, too. Like, the bad guys chasing Beatty on thin ice with a CAR! Or, the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times. I really hated this movie!&#34;,
   &#39;Well, I finally saw it. I didn\&#39;t go when it first came out because, well, frankly, I was afraid. Afraid of how bad it might be, or how disappointing. While not as bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it wasn\&#39;t particularly memorable, or satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience I\&#39;ll never forget. A timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more, saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comic relief--all in a space-opera setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that\&#39;s not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula. It\&#39;s an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave it new twists that made it very special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time. The great villain, Vader was Luke\&#39;s father. Wow, no one saw that coming. Of course, I\&#39;m convinced neither did Lucas till it showed up in the screenplay. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, particularly in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie--tremendous effects, plenty of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its plot--the story it is telling. Oh, certainly, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot coupled with bad acting--that\&#39;s a burden no director can overcome, certainly not one as bad as I\&#39;m forced to realize George Lucas is (The man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors--Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****SPOILERS AHEAD******** The plot. Oh my. Understand, he\&#39;s already handicapped by what\&#39;s happened in the first two films so it\&#39;s an incredible burden. One too much for him to overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First we have the sheer absurdities of the background. We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virginal, miracle birth--the &#34;chosen one&#34;. Well, this detail never gets remotely explained. Indeed, the closest explanation is Yoda\&#39;s observation that maybe they were wrong. Oh, well, okay then. Our mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he\&#39;ll come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there? Wow! How about that. Testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there, eh George? Anyway, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in Cinematic history--the great tragedy of Darth Vador--the good guy who falls from grace, only to finally achieve redemption in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How, pray tell, does this happen? Why, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, sure, he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline, but does it occur to the &#34;dark one to be&#34; to maybe check with a physician cause maybe, just maybe, this futuristic society might can do something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they\&#39;ve been chasing for two films tells him that he\&#39;s got the secret to immortality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, of course he does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can Lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, by the way, Amidala finally dies. In childbirth. Why? Well, they don\&#39;t know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of &#34;she\&#39;s lost the will to live&#34;. Well, oh, okay, of course she has. Maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows of the birth of Luke and Leia. Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them. Knows, also, the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 (curiously, 3PO\&#39;s mind is wiped, but not R2\&#39;s--why????) stating &#34;I think these droids belong to you&#34;, Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be &#34;the chosen one&#34; and apprentice to the Emperor himself, and who just happened to be built on this very planet, says &#34;strange, I don\&#39;t recall owning any droids&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh good grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas simply made this up as he went along. Once he introduced VAder as Luke\&#39;s father, sadly, the story began spinning out of control because HE DIDN\&#39;T KNOW WHAT THE STORY WAS. The plot of Episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine did made any rational sense at all. And none of this ties into the story he originally told in Star Wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s an afterthought, and it looks it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun film to watch, but entirely forgettable. Star Wars will stand in my mind forever. Thankfully, this one, and the two preceding it, will soon fade.&#39;,
   &#34;I picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no Idea what I was getting myself into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started the movie and soon I had been pulled into a world of pain and visual torture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally know what hell is like. It&#39;s this movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. It didn&#39;t even really have a plot. There was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of watching this movie I suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can. You will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t even watch it. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you watch it, then it means they win.&#34;,
   &#34;I mean, really... either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie. It&#39;s stupid, ridiculous and just not funny AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since i saw the preview i knew it wasn&#39;t going to be a great movie, i just didn&#39;t think it was gonna be that bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie? When the actors didn&#39;t have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny?. Now we find ourselves with movies like this one, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just skip this piece of garbage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. (sorry for my English)&#34;,
   &#39;Did anyone else feel as betrayed as I did? The first hour or so was pretty solid but the last. Oh my god. It seemed like it was predictable and cheesy. Not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been. Most reviews have read have been glowing but I really can\&#39;t understand why. I had seriously predicted that general ending WAY earlier on but then retracted it because I thought &#34;No, they would never do that, that\&#39;s FAR too lame.&#34; I can hardly stand it. I feel so unsatisfied. I think i\&#39;m about to walk out the door to go sell every season I own. Someone please. Change my mind. I want to love this. SO bad. Someone tell me why I\&#39;m wrong. Great show. Terrible ending.&#39;,
   &#39;This would\&#39;ve been a *great* silent film. The acting really is good, at least in a Look Ma, I\&#39;m Doing Really Big Acting! sort of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train wreck, I couldn\&#39;t tear my eyes away. This dialogue might\&#39;ve worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This script must\&#39;ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. It simply doesn\&#39;t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMDB does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled &#34;weighted score&#34;. Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn\&#39;t character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. That\&#39;s a plot contrivance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, watch it muted. Perhaps you\&#39;ll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see James Woods in all his dangly male &#34;look-at-me, I\&#39;m-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man&#34; glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t say you weren\&#39;t warned.&#39;,
   &#34;Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently, but couldn&#39;t get myself to watch it through to the end. Just awful! I can&#39;t even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. There&#39;s a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this. GEORGE 2 is probably the single worst sequel I have ever seen, and that is saying something. Jeez, because of IMDb&#39;s 10 lines rule, I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-TV sequel. Disney, hang your head in shame.&#34;,
   &#39;Much like Orson Welles thirty years earlier,Mike Sarne was given &#34;the biggest train set in the world&#34;to play with,but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe. Despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract,the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today.How anyone given the resources at Mr Sarne\&#39;s disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret.Only Michael Cimino ever came close with the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes &#34;Heaven\&#39;s Gate&#34;.Both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least Mr Cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio\&#39;s largesse,whereas Mr Sarne had only the rather fey &#34;Joanna&#34; in his locker. Furthermore,&#34;Heaven\&#39;s Gate&#34; could boast some memorable and well - handled set - pieces where,tragically,&#34;Myra Breckinridge&#34;s cupboard was bare. Simply put,it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of Hollywood.&#39;,
   &#34;As much as I dislike saying &#39;me too&#39; in response to other comments - it&#39;s completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been banned somewhere doesn&#39;t make a film watchable. Just because it doesn&#39;t resemble a Hollywood product does not make it credible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, in addition to no discernible plot (other than there are lots of muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old women, drink lots of vodka) a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating I&#39;m in to my second package of Rolaids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for spoilers - well, the film is so devoid of any narrative thread I couldn&#39;t write one if I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t waste your time or money, and don&#39;t confuse this with good Russian cinema.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie is one of the worst comedy movies i have ever seen. I hate these Napoleon Dynamite rip-offs. Just face it people the dumb humor has been mastered already. Make something new for once. All these new comedies are just horrible. And coming out of SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for a lead role yet. I hope he can bounce back from this awful movie. And Will Arnetts character is just plain bad. Hey Will, did you read the script. The plot is truly the worst ever written. Now you tell me if this is weird. (this is the movie) Rod Kimble&#39;s step dad Frank is dying and the family needs $50,000 to pay for the heart surgery so Rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for Frank. Only so that Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his manliness. Yes thats the movie, you tell me, would u spend $7.00 to see that piece of crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10 just horrible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-adam&#34;,
   &#39;Normally, I don\&#39;t like revenge films....PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise. You see, DI has action, accuracy, exotic locales(i.e. Hong Kong), awesome gun battles, and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat. Like all revenge flicks, it has villains you\&#39;d love to throw out of a plate-glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist, racist, and venomous social stereotypes that invaded &#34;Eye for an Eye&#34; and &#34;Death Wish 2&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the plot department Double Impact is as transparent as saran wrap. Chad and Alex\&#39;s parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that\&#39;s what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys were talking in French accents is a lousy one. It wasn\&#39;t the watery plot that made this movie bad, but the use of clichéd lines and moves from other movies (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really made it worse. But nonetheless Double Impact is still watchable. But why is that shitty movies like this have villains(for example,that greedy British guy that killed Chad and Alex\&#39;s parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick) you would love to hate with fiber of your being?&#39;,
   &#34;A lot of death happens in the wild. You don&#39;t need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out! But does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary? What is with this fascination with gruesome death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions? Or, a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought this was going to be a family-friendly nature film! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film&#39;s trailers? Were the filmmakers afraid of losing money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then in typical, comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent Birds-of-Paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible. It was surreal! It&#39;s as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of First and Second graders on a school field trip! Wow! From the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review, why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socializing; playing; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, like mouth brooding; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many animal species have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty, and why not be much more well-rounded - and focus on delight and inspiration, instead?&#34;,
   &#39;Don\&#39;t waste 90 minutes of your time on &#34;Fast Food, Fast Women.&#34; It\&#39;s annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing, horrific acting, and even bad music. I found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen. SHE needs the fast food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the 90 minutes you\&#39;d devote to this turkey doing something more exciting...like trimming your toenails. You\&#39;d have more entertainment value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming thing about this film is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired script. It\&#39;s as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIEWER BEWARE!&#39;,
   &#34;Yet another film about a tortured self-centered, arrogant, unfeeling hateful, self-destructive lead character we are supposed to care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong I am very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the lead character a strongly self-destructive character. What I object to about this one is that there is so little background to this guy. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? Had the script dealt with this more they might have managed to elicit some sympathy for him. As it is he just comes off as an unpleasant hateful character, not tragic, just hateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking great pains to make this guy as crazy and anti-social as possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the worst film I have ever seen but it is in there putting up a good fight! Man! Don&#39;t waste your time.&#34;,
   &#34;(aka: The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in. The film is supposed to take place in Ireland but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gothic lesbians get invited to a Count&#39;s island castle for the weekend. One by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit. Go figure...(sic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity. Directed by euro horror actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is one snoozer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty boring 2 out of 10&#34;,
   &#39;The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co-stars in this movie. She does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role. I don\&#39;t consider it a supporting role either, but rather a &#34;bit&#34; part. Also the plot has many unexplained elements. Some examples are: why does the main character reject her oldest son? Why does her youngest son drive head on into the train? He says its for a &#34;sucker&#34; bet which doesn\&#39;t explain anything. Obviously the screenwriter doesn\&#39;t know the definition of a sucker bet. This film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and view it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen.&#39;,
   &#39;Almost as tedious to watch as it was to read, Evening is a gorgeously produced failure...until Meryl Streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff. Vanessa Redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young Ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older Ann actually was dying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas. It gave me a headache.&#39;,
   &#34;This film is quite boring. There are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don&#39;t succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin--she does a masterful job handling her character, but Day-Lewis garbles most of his lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this. The incongruities in bouncing between domestic household/marriage issues and political crises are badly matched. Character attitudes change without explanation throughout. Badly disjointed.&#34;,
   &#39;Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you\&#39;re not in the mood for that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something simple, no thinking just plain action when I watched this one. It started of good and was quite entertaining, so why a bad review. Well in the end the movie lost it\&#39;s credibility. The storyline wasn\&#39;t that cheesy at all, the action was not too special but overall good, acting was OK, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But all got ruined because things happened that were over the top, and it left me with a bad feeling. They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the &#34;no thinking just plain action&#34; category. So in conclusion if you know you\&#39;ll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical: don\&#39;t watch! otherwise I\&#39;d say go ahead...&#39;,
   &#34;How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. The hero&#39;s hair probably should&#39;ve gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them. Sadly, it wouldn&#39;t have taken much.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie starts out promisingly, with an early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against Gary Cooper\&#39;s marriage to his daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, playing an unabashed gold-digger, loudly complains to Cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family - including his daughter, Anita Louise. I am a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (to my mind) a Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise a very lovely, versatile and under-appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role. I also have nothing against Teresa Wright, and while not blessed with great range, she usually delivers heart-warming performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a promising opening, the story slides downhill all the way to the end. I found nothing humorous about burning down the home of Cooper\&#39;s would-be in-laws. The butler in such a fastidious, non-smoking household would never just blithely walk away, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill-timed cigarette. Moreover, nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it. And finally, nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket! This whole sequence just made Cooper seem foolish and gauche. It is a poor contrivance - ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forced medical examination of Cooper is equally contrived. Nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent! That Cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny - it\&#39;s absurd! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense, and that, too, is nothing to laugh about. Finally, the scenes of Cooper\&#39;s overly fastidious, neurotic attention to his baby\&#39;s feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies. But to me they just seem tedious and slow. The wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes, while paradoxically, the script writer went to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lines are just not in the script to generate humor. They just miss on all cylinders. The laughs come not a mile-a-minute, but more like a light year-a-minute. The only time the movie has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene that is totally wasted is when both of Cooper\&#39;s love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together. There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine, but none of it was extracted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt. Predictably, it is the Anita Louise character, who gets jilted on her would-be-wedding night! While it is not on camera, that is her fate, and it is not particularly funny - even as a loose end. She hadn\&#39;t done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic (unlike Gail Patrick, say, in My Favorite Wife). Consequently, I was expecting (perhaps &#34;hoping&#34; is a better word in the context of the film!) for Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending, too. The fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie\&#39;s end really undermines the effect of the &#34;happy ending&#34; for Cooper and Wright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept waiting for something to happen, for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era... And it never delivered. A good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here.&#39;,
   &#34;102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believed to be cured, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life. Things are going well for Cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street. When the clock strikes on Big Ben, things turn bad. The hypnotic cure is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glenn Close reprises her role as Cruella de Vil and once again is the highlight of the film. Every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel, which feels more of a repeat of the previous film, rather than a new story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#39;s Changed. \x96 Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)&#34;,
   &#39;No matter how well meaning his &#34;message&#34; is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy.&#39;,
   &#34;A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. It contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that sounds vague it&#39;s because the movie itself is. It&#39;s well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted. Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black &amp; white. Also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does NOT shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). Still, I mostly hated this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film meanders all over the place, is full of unlikable characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moves at a snails pace. Three times I considered leaving the theatre because I was so utterly bored. But the director WAS there so I stayed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete. I really wish I could like this more (there are VERY few films dealing honestly with gay blacks) but I can&#39;t. Unless you&#39;re very interested in the Harlem Renaissance there&#39;s no reason to see this.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie is an insult to ALL submariners. It was stupid. It appeared to have been written by monkeys. The acting was absurd. If this is the view most people have of the Navy, then I weep for our defense. This movie was awful. I put it below &#34;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&#34; as far as submarine movies go. Gene Hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap. Denzel Washington must have been high. Little in the plot makes any sense. And the ending. For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage. If you haven\&#39;t figured it out yet, I didn\&#39;t like it. And if it wasn\&#39;t for all the pro comments, I would not have bothered to post.&#39;,
   &#34;Like most comments I saw this film under the name of The Witching which is the reissue title. Apparently Necromancy which is the original is better but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad. In many ways I think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value! But don&#39;t be fooled -there&#39;s only 3 scenes with nudity and it&#39;s of the people standing around variety. No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is so inherently awful it&#39;s difficult to know what to criticise first. The dialogue is awful and straight out of the Troma locker. At least Troma is tongue in cheek though. This is straight-faced boredom personified. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora the possessed kid in The Innocents would you believe!) the worst with her high-pitched screechy voice. Welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque. The other female lead has a creepy face so I don&#39;t know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the film! And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also looks worringly like Gene Wilder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy. This is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also dreadful and it&#39;s difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up. The &#39;ghost&#39; mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really this film (the witching at least) is only for the unwary. It can&#39;t have many sane fans as it&#39;s pretty unwatchable and I actually found it mind-numbingly dull! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best bit was when the credits rolled - enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie LIKE THE PLAGUE!&#34;,
   &#39;a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing. the movie twists and turns through miriad plot &#34;surprises&#34; at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing, offcourse puncturing the &#34;plot&#34; with steamy scenes they thought would help it along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie. the same applies for the other &#34;actors&#34;. the plot is quite silly and tacky. whih in itelf is not such a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous plot-twists get very tiresome and boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle. in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don\&#39;t fret if you miss this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a rather lame 4!&#39;,
   &#39;Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie. Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie, giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes. That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first it confuses you and then it puts you off. The dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers. Granted, it does that so if you are looking for that ... knock yourself out.&#39;,
   &#39;I would have liked to write about the story, but there wasn\&#39;t any. I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but &#34;hinglish&#34; is only funny for like 5 minutes, after that its overkill. I would have liked to swoon over the \&#39;keep-u-guessing suspense\&#39; but it was as predictable as... um mm, a Yash raj movie (?). I would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action, but I don\&#39;t like cartoons much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people attempting suicide - I promise it\&#39;ll push you over the edge 2. Sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da-Vinci code wore. 3. People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4. Movie Piraters: More power to them. If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton &amp; green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers. Afterthought: The director of the movie, obviously, is a species of his own. ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enough)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that could have made this a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Screenplay writer 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (Did I already say that?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who was challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor=Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - &#34;Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health&#34; ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2. The English sub-titles - &#34;Mera Dil Kho Gaya&#34; becomes - &#34;My heart is in a void&#34; , &#34;Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya&#34; turns into &#34;Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond&#34; ..priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Tashan to me, is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours! Woot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sigh*..But thats just me. I could be wrong You\&#39;ve been warned anyways.&#39;,
   &#39;What an absolute pile of pants. Having read Chris Brookmyre\&#39;s books religiously since I came across &#34;Quite Ugly...&#34;, I was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I obviously had too much faith. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesn\&#39;t quite fit. How anyone can read the book, and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entire characters are changed, situations are dropped, and to see Parlablane\&#39;s dramatic break-in reduced to Nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window... it brought tears to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dread to think what\&#39;s going to happen with &#34;Country Of The Blind&#34; if this is the benchmark...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, just avoid it...&#39;,
   &#39;Envy stars some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, one can only expect the best. However, with &#34;Envy&#34;, no one could save this disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and co-workers at a sandpaper factory. Both are making a decent living, but because Tim has a better performance at work, he\&#39;s able to afford more than his buddy Nick. Nick is a dreamer who\&#39;s always coming up with new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear (Yes, I\&#39;m serious). Falling in love with the idea, Nick decides to really invent this product. He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 50/50. Tim refuses thinking the idea will never work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick\&#39;s invention, titled &#34;va-poo-rize&#34; (again, i\&#39;m serious), ends up making millions. He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer, and fancy deserts. Tim starts feeling envy for Nick. Hence the name of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept isn\&#39;t bad, but it still turns out awful. This movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast. Then again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. Not even the great Christoper Walken, playing a homeless character named &#34;J-man&#34;, made this movie funny. The movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this movie if: *you like crap (no pun intended) *you want to see Jack Black in a white tux&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say, avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid ESPECIALLY if: *you\&#39;re offended by bathroom humor *you love animals&#39;,
   &#34;Most of the episodes on Season 1 are awful..There is no comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they programs actually had decent story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are well dull..not amazing in the least..go rent or buy the Twilight Zone series...I have heard Season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the DVD&#39;s they cut out the Ray Walston parts which further diminishes this compilation. The one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985...Most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering...&#34;,
   &#39;Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his bossy fiancé, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception. It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation. But, horror of horrors, the &#34;angel&#34; ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, arrives without wings. In an ensuing fight with the sculptor, the heavy &#34;ice&#34; maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter. Now, one year later, Henry\&#39;s sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward. Yet, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) becomes interested in Henry herself, much to the chagrin of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley, as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen. No, its not the cast, as they try gamely to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancé and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious. Biggs, a funny thespian, too, is totally wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please) he tries hardest of all and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, looks, and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable. But, nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one. Even were free tickets to fall into your lap, be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who adore love-and-laugh cinema.&#39;,
   &#34;Three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock&#39;s novel for the tube, yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn&#39;t know when to quit. Struggling artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy, enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning about the last gathering held there--Ellen&#39;s daughter&#39;s coming-out party--Tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began, nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another! Two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn&#39;t bear close scrutiny, one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity. Burstyn&#39;s role teeters on camp, while Tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy-eyed-waif routine. Only one sequence late in the film (the morning after the mural is finished) is charged with honest feeling, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.&#34;,
   &#39;I wasn\&#39;t at all a fan of the 2005 gore fest hit &#34;Hostel&#34;, and most of these lame ass knock-offs are just as bad or worse - yet &#34;Live Feed&#34; managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes. Started off with plenty of sex and sleazy settings, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese Organized Crime Squad and a 7-foot, leather-aproned butcher... What put me out of the movie was the tough \&#39;hero\&#39; with the guns and a grudge saving the day... I would call this movie mediocre, at best, since a premise mainly involving obnoxious young people being slaughtered in a seedy porno theater, doubling as a hideout for the mafia, is appealing to me. If only the torture was prolonged enough to be thoroughly effective, then my rating would have differed greatly. Unfortunately, most of the gruesomeness is heaped together in one scene, leaving the rest of the movie to conclude as a revenge-type scenario. So, basically, it IS just a low-budget &#34;Hostel&#34; rip-off with the redeeming use of gratuitous sex, almost constant during the first half of the film... Overall, I would say don\&#39;t bother with this one.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m going to write about this movie and about &#34;Irreversible&#34; (the (in)famous scene in it). So you are warned, if you haven\&#39;t seen the movie yet. This are just my thoughts, why I think the movie fails (in the end - pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting wise, Rosario Dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger (a teenager in other words). The villain guy is good, but loses his &#34;evil&#34; touch right before the end. If he really never changes, then why would he let a woman tie him up? He wouldn\&#39;t, period. Then we also have the bartender/2nd rape Dude. Actually I don\&#39;t think you would need him. At least not for the 2nd rape, but more about that later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s reprise the story. Rosarios character is sexually insecure, might even have lesbian tendencies (see her scene with a female friend). This wasn\&#39;t intentional, as Rosario states herself, but there is sexual tension between them. Rosario\&#39;s character meets a guy, who is a sexual Predator, in all the bad senses. But he makes an impression on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before. I beg to differ. Because she acts, as if it is her first boyfriend, which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. Talking about her mother, here\&#39;s another problem. After the first rape takes place, Rosarios character doesn\&#39;t tell anyone what happened. Seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one, nothing of that gets explored after that. If Rosarios character wouldn\&#39;t call her mother anymore or would behave strangely, the mother would be worried like crazy. There was so much potential here. Also her female friend: We see her at the party, it\&#39;s obvious there is something going on and &#34;boom&#34; she is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first rape is almost unbearable to watch. But feels like a pinch, when you compare it to the ending (rape), which feels like you\&#39;re getting hit with a sledge hammer! After rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. Threads are opened (such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian, as one guy states who tried to hit on her ...), but left in the open. No real social contact is established, if you leave the bartender guy out, who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. It\&#39;s apparent that he isn\&#39;t a &#34;nice&#34; guy and his character get\&#39;s fleshed out a bit. But when Rosarios character meets her rapist in class again, his being in the movie seems pointless. We get the point that Rosarios character isn\&#39;t the same anymore, that she went &#34;bad&#34; and is able to hurt people. (Too) Many scenes show exactly that, her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. Back to Rapist #1 who cheats on a test, gets caught by Rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again (really?). As absurd as that sounds, the guy meets up with her, not without us having seen him beforehand, with another girl (very likely that he raped her too, although we never see anything of that, fortunately) and his football career. Well career is a stretch and he is bullied. This is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works, but then again is too cliché to stay with you. So Rapist #1 submits to Rosarios character ... why exactly? Because he promised her, it was her day? Again, really? A guy like that never loses control, especially with a woman he raped before ... I guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. The bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something, but letting him submit like that, just feels wrong. Another possibility would have a drug in his drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So rapist #1 undresses and get\&#39;s blindfolded and let\&#39;s Rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously, that\&#39;s just crazy! But what comes next, is even crazier. First she talks to him, then she &#34;shuts&#34; him up and forces an object into him. This is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. This isn\&#39;t about what this guy deserves or not, it\&#39;s just intense. And of course that was what they were aiming for. Now after she is &#34;done&#34; the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist #1. If this really should work as a revenge movie, it would have been better if Rosarios character herself would have been doing all the &#34;revenge&#34;. Having a henchman doing the job, takes away everything that was built up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn\&#39;t supposed to be entertaining/enjoyable, it\&#39;s a hard watch &amp; it is Art-house. But the 10 minute (I didn\&#39;t count ) rape scene at the end, just smashes everything. Rosarios character is more or less, only watching what happens. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irreversible comparison: &#34;Irreversible&#34; had the rape scene, but the movie went on (even if it was back into time). Rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. First, that comes a bit too late, that should see her say that after the initial rape. And secondly and most importantly, this is where the Art-house movie should\&#39;ve come in. It is more interesting seeing were Rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope, with what she had done. But then again, she didn\&#39;t actually physically do that much (see above) ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good intentions (Talia and Rosario had worked before), but failing to convey most of the things, they set out to do (even if you can see what they meant, it has to be convincing, otherwise it doesn\&#39;t work) ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...&#39;,
   &#34;Beyond a shadow of a doubt Mysterious Planet is one of the worst movies ever made, yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes (and to be honest that&#39;s all you need to see) combine to create something that is hilariously side-splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening scene in &#39;space&#39; is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets, as washing-up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue. Before you&#39;ve had time to work out whether it&#39;s you who&#39;s gone mad, the credits roll and the action struggles to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And aside from the double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes, you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices AND the dubbed voices at the same time. Pure genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that I&#39;ve only ever seen one copy, so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely. Perhaps I own the only copy in existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;This little show is obviously some stupid little prequel/spin off of the original series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the live action series this show is utter crap. The live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines. While the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline in every episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. Thats basiclly the idea every episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were Gem says &#34;just adore me for now&#34; and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god. (which is quite right since he\&#39;s her mind control slave) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or the effort.&#39;,
   &#39;Republic pictures comes late in the game to the &#34;werewolf&#34; er Werecat genre. The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts. He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller. The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents, something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a &#34;catman&#34;. Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancé ends up dead. Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn\&#39;t know if he\&#39;s the killer or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed. There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections. The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer, he\&#39;s the most interesting thing in this film. despite its short running time (just over an hour) I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it. As good as the talk is, I just wished someone would do something. When it finally did happen, in the closing minutes, it was too little too late..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a pass.&#39;,
   &#39;I have never seen any of Spike Lee\&#39;s prior films, as their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen, and admire Denzel Washington, and Jodie Foster\&#39;s work, and have several of their DVDs. I was, however, entirely disappointed with this movie. If this film is any indication of Spike Lee\&#39;s ability as a director, my advice would be to &#34;get a job&#34;, and stop wasting the time and talent of others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that I\&#39;d seen. I can only assume, from their sappy lovelorn reviews, that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work. I only paid $2.50, in a &#34;Second Run&#34; theater, and still felt I\&#39;d wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IMDb &#34;Trivia&#34; page says it all.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &#34;Shot in 39 days&#34; -- How can you expect to shoot a big budget &#34;Blockbuster&#34;, (as the media hype promised), in such a short time? No wonder there was such a weak performance by all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &#34;Ron Howard was first going to direct the film...&#34; -- He may have done this project some justice, given more time to do so, of course. Though the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK! maybe not. I\&#39;m sorry! This film was so rife with pitiful cliché\&#39;s, implausible scenes, and lousy characterizations, that maybe even he couldn\&#39;t have made much of it. (Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell...Good call!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &#34;Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks.&#34; -- And it showed! Her portrayal of a &#34;Fixer&#34;, who makes people\&#39;s problems go away, was as unbelievable as the script she was given. Did she even want to be there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Peeves: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door, and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank, and he\&#39;d better keep away...or else? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When &#34;Detective Frazier&#34;, (Denzel Washington), comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet, how many bank robbers, without a gun, would have &#34;led&#34; a cop, (much less &#34;let&#34; a cop) back out to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Det. Frazier later claimed, to have given the robber &#34;every reason to shoot me.&#34; Why, then, in their brief struggle, didn\&#39;t he even try to expose the robber\&#39;s face? That may have gotten the response he was looking for...a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification. And why did it take &#34;Steve, Stevie, Steve-O&#34;, (the robber\&#39;s accomplice), so long to come and help out? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I understand that these weren\&#39;t your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda, and didn\&#39;t want anyone harmed. But the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn\&#39;t. To them it was a desperate situation. Why then, when two of the bad guys stepped outside to &#34;pick up the pizzas?&#34;, were they not taken down. (first of all, how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield? Is this Spike Lee\&#39;s version of NY City, or SNL\&#39;s?). Taking them down would have reduced the bad guy\&#39;s numbers, screwed up their plans, and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up. If not, there at least would be fewer bad guys inside. (Give SWAT something to do, or send them home!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* What police department in this country, would have allowed Madeline White, (Jodie Foster), to just waltz right into the bank, and discuss a matter with the robbers, that she would not disclose to them first? She had no authority, no governmental credentials; and besides, this was after all, &#34;already&#34; a hostage situation...add one more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why wouldn\&#39;t the Bank CEO, (Christopher Plummer), just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! The diamonds, he could have sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Who was that &#34;schmuck&#34;, (the character, not the actor), with the Jersey accent, that, conveniently, volunteered, and said he knew the recording was &#34;100% Albanian&#34;, but yet he himself couldn\&#39;t speak it.....SIR! PUT YOUR HAND DOWN! And his Ex-wife! What a &#34;schlump&#34; she was!!! Both were totally unbelievable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When interrogating suspects, why did Det. Frazier, continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist?, (i.e. - telling the elderly woman she could go, and then she couldn\&#39;t, then could; then couldn\&#39;t?) Give me a break! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites, couldn\&#39;t deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Near the end of the movie, a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens hid out for &#34;a week&#34;....where did the materials come from? (the drywall &amp; studs). It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer, so he could relieve himself. The bank employees hadn\&#39;t complained about the smell, all week long? Hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* After such a debacle; since the documents &#34;had&#34; fallen into the robber\&#39;s hands, what kind of &#34;references&#34; was Ms. White expecting to get from the bank CEO, seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail, due to her failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* And last, but certainly not least, What\&#39;s with the &#34;Electric Glide&#34; that Denzel did? HOW STUPID! Was that supposed to indicate his &#34;resolve&#34; to bring these guys to justice? He looked, rather, like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart, while trying to prevent a bowel movement! &#34;Cheeee-Zheeee&#34;!!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the mediocre plot; lousy script; bad acting; and overall pitiful directing......yada, yada, yada. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&#39;,
   &#39;This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. You should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here, there are SPOILERS. Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin (Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh). Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister; living together in everyone else\&#39;s eyes as man and wife. No sex but just about everything else. Early on, the movie starts with its theme: \&#39;the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions\&#39;. Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch. Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him, she does it and gets to the nitty-gritty questions too. When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3-way date. Charlie (Bridget Moynahan) is the girl of THEIR dreams, like all the right things etc\x85 Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal! That Charlie accepts! In one week Charlie, Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas. In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns (apparently Charlie has an off-the-rack figure). Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a $10,000 frock for her. While Charlie is zipping her in this \&#39;down-payment-on-a-house\&#39; gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte (I swear it was like a feed bag). What should happen but \&#39;woops!\&#39; latte all over the gown. It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdale\&#39;s bridal salon with out a $10,000 mocha colored gown. Back to \&#39;reality\&#39; \x96 Caesar\&#39;s palace Las Vegas. They have the \&#39;high roller room\&#39; (Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist \x96 were do they get all this money?) Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drink-a-thon were, you guessed it - they kiss. Gray remembers everything; Charlie remembers nada. They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line &#34;If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds&#34; Gray gets the hiccups. Gray excuses herself, for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again \&#39;hiccups\&#39;. Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets, literally. And of course one is you guessed it again! Gay. The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver (Alan Cummings) named Gordy. He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned. They become great friends. This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss. He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment. When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office. Gray works at an ad agency. This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone. It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency. Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a not-so-private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office. This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew: Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar. \&#39;Sorry no men\&#39; says the bouncer. So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag. Bad drag. He was in a sleeveless black satin-like blouse, a string of pearls, and a grandma\&#39;s church hat. No lesbian would ever confuse this \&#39;man in a dress\&#39; as a drag queen much less a woman. The bar was also the straight man\&#39;s fantasy of what a lesbian bar is: full of Victoria\&#39;s Secret models. Everything turns out peachy \x96 she goes home with her firm\&#39;s client. Gray happens to be on the woman\&#39;s account and finally does more then kiss. For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with Gray, but that is for the sequel.&#39;,
   &#39;Disney has now made straight-to-video sequels to a good bunch of their many animated features. Two of these were made for their 1991 classic, &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34;. Well, these ones aren\&#39;t really sequels, as they are both set in between the events of the first film. The first of these two straight-to-video films was &#34;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&#34;, which seems to be disliked by quite a few fans of its theatrical predecessor, but I think that can usually be expected with sequels. However, this second one, &#34;Belle\&#39;s Magical World&#34;, is definitely inferior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film features three short stories, all of which take place while Belle is in the castle, and the place is under the spell of the enchantress. The first is &#34;The Perfect Word&#34;, where a misunderstanding at the table between Belle and the Beast leads to trouble, and neither wants to be the first to apologize. The next story is &#34;Fifi\&#39;s Folly&#34;, where Fifi and Lumiere\&#39;s fifth anniversary is coming up, and Lumiere is unprepared, so Belle helps him. However, Fifi sees Lumiere practicing romance with Belle, and thinks they\&#39;re actually in love. The film ends with &#34;The Broken Wing&#34;. In this story, Belle takes care of a bird with a broken wing, but a bird in the castle will probably mean trouble if the Beast finds out, as he hates birds! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot description I gave is for the original VHS version of Disney\&#39;s third &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34; movie. Apparently, in the DVD version, there is another story added called &#34;Mrs. Potts\&#39;s Party&#34;, but I\&#39;ve only seen the original version. However, since I highly doubt that one story would stand out as a classic over the rest, I see no point in watching the special edition. Anyway, the first thing I will say about &#34;Belle\&#39;s Magical World&#34; is that the animation is very 2-dimensional compared to what we\&#39;re used to from Disney, which would obviously disappoint many people. I didn\&#39;t like &#34;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&#34; that much, but you certainly can\&#39;t say the same about its animation. I\&#39;m sure the stories in &#34;Belle\&#39;s Magical World&#34; could entertain many kids (mostly younger ones, I think), and each story has a moral, so they could also teach them some valuable lessons. However, for adults, the film really doesn\&#39;t have a lot. I personally didn\&#39;t find any good humour in it, found that the constant conflict between Belle and the Beast got tiring, and the stories did not impress me too much at all in any way (they\&#39;re not very well written). In &#34;The Perfect Word&#34;, the way Belle says to the Beast, &#34;You\&#39;re acting rude... and foolish!&#34; is a bit cheesy, and I think there are quite a few other cheesy moments in these stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time this straight-to-video movie first came out, I was around eleven or twelve years old. I don\&#39;t know what I would have thought of it at the time, as I had lost interest in Disney by then, and it would be years before I would gain any of that interest back. Even when this movie was first released, I think I was a bit past the age group it was aimed at. I never saw &#34;Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas&#34; until a couple months ago, but unlike that film, I never even heard of this one until recently, I think just after seeing the first sequel to Disney\&#39;s 1991 hit. Well, as much as I like the theatrical original, I wouldn\&#39;t have been missing much if I never became aware of this film\&#39;s existence. For little kids, I\&#39;m sure &#34;Belle\&#39;s Magical World&#34; can be highly entertaining, and probably somewhat educational with its morals, but I do not recommend it for adult Disney fans.&#39;,
   &#39;This is the kind of movie that my enemies content I watch all the time, but it\&#39;s not bloody true. I only watch it once in a while to make sure that it\&#39;s as bad as I first thought it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some kind of mobsters hijack a Boeing 747. (That, at least, is an improvement over having Boeing hijack a good part of the Pentagon.) The airplane goes down in the Bermuda triangle and sinks pressurized to the bottoms, a kind of post-facto submarine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has one of those all-star casts, the stars either falling or barely above the horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;We\&#39;re on our own!&#34;, says pilot Jack Lemon. He is so right. Except for George Kennedy. He\&#39;s in all these disaster movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch another movie instead. Oh, not &#34;Airport&#34; the original. That\&#39;s no good either. Instead, watch a decent flick about stuck airplanes like &#34;Flight of the Phoenix.&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for the advertised movie on TV. They said it was a comedy! The movie started, 10 minutes passed, after that 30 minutes and I didn&#39;t laugh not even once. The fact is that the movie ended and I didn&#39;t get even on echance to laugh. PLEASE, someone tickle me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.&#34;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m glad the folks at IMDb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into. I had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy, but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama I wasn\&#39;t sure. For a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous &#34;twist&#34; ending, which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is. It is hard to describe just how amateurish THE HAZING really is. Did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing? Actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is.&#39;,
   &#34;The first half was OK, but the last half really, really disappointed. It&#39;s funny the producers even admitted they didn&#39;t have a clue for the ending, and it really showed. Whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this. I really didn&#39;t want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn&#39;t really worth that effort. When Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited with the prospect of a better remake, it didn&#39;t happen that first season border on being space porn. They eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama, so I started watching again. But to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel, same with baltar and six was pretty dumb.&#34;,
   &#39;Misty Ayers had a smoking body, and that\&#39;s all this movie was about. Pure exploitation flick. I started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music. And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Case in point: casually walking into a room and saying &#34;Hello&#34; was scored with chase music from a roman epic. I\&#39;d like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this movie: that women\&#39;s low-rise panties existed in 1954. I\&#39;m talking Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is Misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing (except for bra and panties, sadly). Also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a &#34;Look out! Godzirra!&#34; effect.&#39;,
   &#34;As much as I like Japanese movies this one didn&#39;t just cut it... A movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photography is OK, though I&#39;ve seen much better sword fight scenes in other Japanese movies, the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didn&#39;t convince me at all. The soundtrack is so weak you don&#39;t even notice its presence.But worst of all was the way the plot evolved.I have to admit that, at some times, I had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on...Anyway the platonic love between the main character and another one was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if your looking for an action Japanese movie this isn&#39;t it. Its very slow, with very few sword fight scenes and very sentimental... in a bad way...&#34;,
   &#34;After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough &amp; Dynamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in films, Chaplin made about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing, editing, gags, location shooting, etc. This one takes place at a racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying. Mabel Normand is there with her friend also, and Chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and Mabel&#39;s friends. He then woos Mabel in the grandstand with no apparent repercussions from his behavior. Lots of slapstick in here, but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching Chaplin develop. The print I saw was badly deteriorated, which may have affected its enjoyment. Charley Chase can be glimpsed. * of 4 stars.&#34;,
   &#34;wow, the Naked Brothers Band. What should i say. I guess i can say this show just sucks. number one: they have no talent, they probably can&#39;t even play the instruments. number 2: on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on. Look, i really don&#39;t hate it that bad, i&#39;d give it like a 4 out of 10, but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and Nat is SO deep and writes deep lyrics. Deep my ass! he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. wow, i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that. And they didn&#39;t get famous by themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show. i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon.&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;ve now watched all four Bo Derek vehicles directed by her husband, John; all are quite terrible, of course, but this is certainly the pits. Featuring the usual flimsy plot, bad scripting \x96 by the director, naturally \x96 and acting, not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star, it deals with her losing much older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired Hemingway!!) but who continues to appear and talk to her. In fact, he wants to come back in another, younger body\x85but actually does so only in the very last scene! Derek is lovely as always, and still playing naïve(!) \x96 especially during a muddled mid-section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa. Quinn, too, is typically larger-than-life (read: hammy) here, but this easily constitutes his nadir; besides, for much of the duration, he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic (presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo)! His &#39;replacement&#39;, then, is obviously a handsome-looking stud who hasn&#39;t a lick of talent or even personality. Also featured in the cast are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn&#39;s best friend and Bo&#39;s business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn&#39;s guardian angel in the afterlife) \x96 plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who presumably needed this on his resume&#39;)! It also goes without saying that John Derek was his own cinematographer on the film, that the end credits are filled with useless (and corny) expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand, and that GHOSTS CAN&#39;T DO IT swept the board at the 1990 Razzie Awards!&#34;,
   &#39;You know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It was made it the 50\&#39;s 2. It\&#39;s in black and white. 3. It has no name actors! 4. Screaming makes up for the lack of special effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well not to be outdone - this movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay - shhhhh but I am gonna discuss special effects here - or lack of them - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you catch the underwater scenes? It looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium - note the cape flapping in the breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the repeated re-use of Stock Footage, (exterior house shots, the bridges scenes -- great enhanced the K-R-A-F-Tiness of this film - not since &#34;PLAN 9&#34; - have I seen such creative usage of stock footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey where there was a lack of special effects - not to worry - screaming DOES take the place of special effects in this movie as well. Yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab the popcorn - set your brain on stun (several fermented beverages DEFINITELY helps), sit back, and wonder: why the heck did they put this on film again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wayno&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;this film was a major letdown. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited. the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the lead protagonist\&#39;s character was as slimy as they come. the sickroom/hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, i\&#39;ve been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid &#34;horror&#34; was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles,as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess.i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed,this film might especially appeal to you.&#39;,
   &#34;S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself. There was absolutely no acting to speak of. The best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.The budgeting of this movie was sufficient. The filming was sub sesame street. The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book out there for this movie I&#39;m sure it&#39;s better. I would avoid this at all costs. I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.&#34;,
   &#39;...well, pop this into the DVD, waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back, and find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting? What acting? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Production values? ...Production? ...Values?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story? Don\&#39;t get me started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many years of posting on IMDb, I never thought I would see a film so bad that I truly wished for a lower rating than one. I always have found at least a reason or two to see merit - if only in the intent or the effort of the writer, the director, the cast, or the producer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, they\&#39;re all the same guy (!) who really needs to get a handle on the fact, at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape, that he has no talent. I mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high schooler\&#39;s &#34;production&#34; for his first cinema class, but the referenced &#34;artist&#34; behind this dreck was twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just how did this ever get made? Who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this? Moreover, don\&#39;t let the box cover fool you: there\&#39;s not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good &#34;exposure&#34; of the hunk on that cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two final items: there was one second when this &#34;film&#34; had redeeming value: the aforementioned &#34;talent&#34; gets roundly punched out by his lover. I cheered! And, I did learn one thing from this &#34;film.&#34;. There are times when something is so very bad that it is, indeed, truly very funny. But not in any comical manner; it\&#39;s just sadly humorous. Very sadly humorous.&#39;,
   &#39;If anybody really wants to understand Hitler, read WWI history not WWII history. Find out what happened during that war, how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time. How so many soldiers went insane, from what they saw during WWI, at the time they called it &#34;shellshocked&#34; now the call it post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the true horrors of WWI, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death, not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie unfortunately misses that, as so many others do. Read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie &#34;paths of glory&#34;, the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie, the sense of helplessness, and a utter devaluation of human life, as nothing more than bullet catchers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats what this movie misses, its really the key point to understanding Germany. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, for no real reason. Then comes an utter economic collapse, following the war. Those are the factors that create extremism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism. Unfortunately this movie ignored these factors, and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile. With really no real value, there are fictional movie\&#39;s based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of Hitler than this does. They just threw Hitlers name on this so it would sell more.&#39;,
   &#34;After Life is a Miracle, I did not expect much. It&#39;s hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for instance. Zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story. The wild and unbridled humor of Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. It appears that Kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, beginning with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked his early films so much, and this is why it&#39;s especially disappointing to see something like this. Let&#39;s hope his next one will be great.&#34;,
   &#39;Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect &#34;catch&#34; by any woman that runs across him; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film? He\&#39;s a &#34;hero&#34; whom it\&#39;s very difficult to empathize with, so the movie is in trouble right from the start. However, it\&#39;s troubles don\&#39;t end there. It has the production values of a TV-movie (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the ending cheats in a way that I can\&#39;t reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely). Let\&#39;s just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows. (*1/2)&#39;,
   &#34;This film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew. Based on Shielah Graham&#39;s autobiography, it seems like the powers that be couldn&#39;t leave well enough alone. They couldn&#39;t decide if this was to be Graham&#39;s story or Fitzgerald&#39;s story, and also how much they should soft-pedal whoever&#39;s story it turned out to be. So a film that could have been a story about two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Ms. Graham)personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either. Added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959. Clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing. However - and this saved the film for me - Kerr has never looked lovelier, and Peck is as always a very handsome man. They truly make a beautiful, mature couple, and I only wish they had better material to work with. There is one scene that does work - Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunken state, and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs. Other than that, the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other Wald produced soaps of the 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING).&#34;,
   &#39;A Blair Witch-War Movie that is as much of a letdown as Bwitch was! The title says it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as &#34;Once Upon a Time in America&#34;, &#34;The Shawshank Redemption&#34; or &#34;Enemy at the Gates&#34; (if you want to watch a GREAT &#34;war&#34; movie) etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie, if it were a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the rookies, then this movie was High school ball. It was filmed as if it were a High school drama club filming with their daddy\&#39;s old camera. Sure they went into a hostile area (to make a film) but I don\&#39;t call that brave, around here we call that plain stupid! This is a pass all the way! Now go watch it and then you tell me what you think.&#39;,
   &#39;Jesus Christ, I can\&#39;t believe I\&#39;ve wasted my time watching this movie. I only watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this film almost put me off her. This is absolutely awful! I could have been watching Survivor Series 93 over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lead guy in this was so bland and generic. I would love it if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove \&#39;91\&#39;d his ass through a glass window. I was enraging every time he was saying &#34;lake&#34; and &#34;cabin&#34;. I\&#39;d kick his ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. A true angel. But she couldn\&#39;t even save this utter joke of a film. Sadly, she couldn\&#39;t even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug. It looked hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also loved the bit where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. It reminded me of a time where...nevermind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anayways, do watch this film because of it\&#39;s awfulness.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie is just another average action flick, but it could have been so much better. When the guns come out they really needed some choreography help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in Heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the show-down, the one we had been waiting for, but was like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing hits, and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old, same old.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie kinda let me down. It seemed a lot like the movie Jaws when the Hopper was telling the Mayor to close parks was like when Roy Shider was telling the Mayor to close the beaches. They both said no way its summer! But the box says Hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one. But he really doesn&#39;t do anything too interesting or exciting. I&#39;m not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case. They just say lets do police work and we&#39;ll solve it. And whats up with all the old men with pool cues. I didn&#39;t even begin to believe that they were mob bosses. And then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer. With his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his Di@k is the size of a schoolbus. Come on what cruddy lines. I thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. I got this movie used and wouldn&#39;t buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee.&#34;,
   &#39;Hollywood\&#39;s misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits. For every &#34;Godfather II,&#34; there are dozens of &#34;More American Graffiti\&#39;s,&#34; &#34;Stayin\&#39; Alives,&#34; and &#34;Grease 2\&#39;s.&#34; While the original &#34;Grease&#34; is not a great film, the 1977 adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960\&#39;s, energetic choreography, and an appealing cast. When Paramount began work on a follow-up, the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for moviegoers, Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts. Her talent and beauty were already evident herein, and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform. Maxwell Caulfield, however, lacks even the skill to express embarrassment, and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic. What romantic interest, beyond hormones, could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory. Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden, Connie Stevens, and Sid Caesar have any wit, although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers have complained that, because &#34;Grease 2&#34; is always compared to the original, the movie comes up lacking. However, even taken on its own terms, the film is a clunker. After a frenetic opening number, which evidently exhausted the entire cast, the energy dissipates. With few exceptions, the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960\&#39;s, and the only nostalgia evoked is for &#34;Our Miss Brooks&#34; and &#34;Sid Caesar\&#39;s Comedy Hour.&#34; The jokes fall flat, and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite. However, worse films have been inflicted on audiences, and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters. Unfortunately, &#34;Grease 2&#34; is not even unintentionally funny. Instead, the film holds the viewer\&#39;s attention like a bad train wreck. Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered, the next scene plunges into even worse carnage.&#39;,
   &#39;This is, without a doubt, the most offensive &#34;chick flick&#34; I have seen in years, if not ever. The writing &amp; characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody. Before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster, we were subjected to the following themes: having a baby will solve all of your problems, &#34;performer types&#34; are miserable messes, &amp; musicians can\&#39;t be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast &amp; some great-looking sets &amp; costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life, she\&#39;ll end up - shudder - &#34;alone!&#34;, I felt queasy. I can\&#39;t believe this movie made it to theatrical release. It\&#39;s the sort of fare one expects from those &#34;women\&#39;s&#34; cable channels that I always pass right by when channel-surfing. I am female and over 35, so I should be part of this film\&#39;s target audience, but boy, does &#34;Evening&#34; miss its target.&#39;,
   &#34;While I watched this movie, I tried to figure out why they bothered making it. Though the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelated/unnecessary subplots. The marketing people in Hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys, perpetual double-crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex. It&#39;s odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the President and his mistress. The many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed - I really didn&#39;t feel like I knew any character, except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what might have been, but what was supposed to be. In the end, there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double-cross. I&#39;m surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie. This seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.&#34;,
   &#39;This film reminds me a lot of the anti-drug films of the 50\&#39;s and 60\&#39;s due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about. Tom Hanks and his buddies are &#34;role playing&#34;, but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing Hanks falling for the lady in the group. quite funny but misguided. I wonder how many poor kids had their D&amp;D stuff destroyed, and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction. As a film it\&#39;s basically an after school special, bad acting (although Hanks does show some of his talent) and relationship talks, and no one seems to be having any fun. It seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism, which is more serious, apparently, and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does. Despite my vote of 2, this is worth watching due to its unique genre, scare films, which I personally find quite funny.&#39;,
   &#34;There&#39;s not much to say about this one. Gammera is some kind of fire breathing turtle. He is loosed by a nuclear explosion. He heads for land and begins to destroy building and tanks and other junk (oh yeah, power lines. I almost forgot). At one time, early in the film, he befriends a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away, or squashing him, he places him down on the ground. Safe. From then on we have to watch this chubby faced little twerp show up and run away, show up and run away, show up and run away. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this kid from 20,000 feet away. Oh, well, the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be put on board a rocket and shot into space. As usual, the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of Americans), uses up enough ammunition and fire power to solve the national debt, and, of course, it does no good. They should know this anyway. We&#39;ve seen a lot of monsters stomp on Tokyo. Not to put these down because they can be fun, but it&#39;s really not very good.&#34;,
   &#34;what kind of sh*t is this? Power rangers vs Freddy? It was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams, it started to become childish. This sh*t should have been rated PG or PG-13 rather than R. I expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1/3 of the film. The rest are for little kids. Plus it&#39;s focused too much on Christianity. I know Freddy&#39;s a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why does it always have to be Christianity? This is total Orientalism and filled with white men/westerner&#39;s superiority. Don&#39;t&#39; watch this, show it to little kids who loves power rangers.&#34;,
   &#39;While Bondarchuk was by no means a young man when he was commissioned to work on this project, he was still a novice director with only a single pictures, a successful adaptation of a short WWII story, to his name. Bondarchuk of course had already been an established acting star for a decade but thespian skills mean little behind the camera, and as a director he was woefully unprepared to undertake a production of such scale. And it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes, often unfortunate camera positions, performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task actors were apparently left to their own devices, awkward voiceovers that sound like radio broadcast announcements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vidor\&#39;s &#34;War and Peace&#34; was probably the main reason that prompted the Soviet government to spare no expense on this production. The USSR release of the Vidor\&#39;s picture made quite a splash. Certainly, Bondarchuk wanted to emulate the greatest strength of the Hollywood film and find his own Audrey. His final choice, Lyudmila Savelyeva, a big-eyed sprightly dark-haired thing indeed somewhat resembles Hepburn. Unfortunately she was a Kirov ballet dancer without neither acting experience nor talent, so unsurprisingly the most kind word that I can find to describe her performance is &#34;awful&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it might be expected that Soviet actors, speaking the same language as Tolstoy\&#39;s characters, would have better understanding of them than foreigners but this War and Peace often proves that not to be the case. The revolutionary upheaval swept away the thin upper layer of Russian cultural soil, that the world of War and Peace grown out of, so a good share of these big name Soviet actors involved in this production often look as clueless as Americans performing Shakespeare ( I don\&#39;t mean of course that American actors can\&#39;t possibly play Shakespeare credibly, but you\&#39;ll know what I mean if you witnessed American members of the cast in Branagh\&#39;s adaptations). Of the three main characters only Bondarchuk\&#39;s Pierre is commendable, but even he was too old for the part and feels out of place in the early going.&#39;,
   &#34;This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn&#39;t every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.&#34;,
   &#34;...had I watched it in my teenage years. This movie was mildly entertaining. What I liked about Soul Survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes, and the constant flips between &#39;dream&#39; and &#39;reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had there not been movies like &#39;The 6th Sense&#39; and &#39;Don&#39;t Look Now&#39; I would have been surprised by the ending.&#34;,
   &#39;I had high expectations following &#34;My Beautiful Laundrette&#34;, &#34;Bend it like Beckham&#34; and (less so) &#34;East is East&#34;. The histories of British Asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness gracious me, etc). This one falls flat. Inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately this was a horribly typical BBC effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a &#34;those were the days&#34; soundtrack, and lots of &#34;issues&#34; in an attempt to be worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself cringing at many points during this film. The writing is predictable. Every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. In fact, I have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that weren\&#39;t. The characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy Indian parents; the working class neighbour; the \&#39;wise\&#39; profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. The script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. And why it had to be set in the 70\&#39;s (apart from needing an excuse for a 70\&#39;s soundtrack) is a mystery. Possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. I don\&#39;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. Instead, the usual &#34;BBC comedy&#34; suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. &#34;Bend it like Beckham&#34; had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story. Give it a miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Transylvania 6-5000&#34; is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80\&#39;s horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script. Two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent, very much against their will, to Transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film, like a little guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table. The wholesome of the film, however, is not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong. The Roger Corman production &#34;Transylvania Twist&#34;, which came out four years after this, is a lot funnier and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodying the classic Universal milestones of the early 30\&#39;s, so you better make sure you\&#39;ve seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references. There\&#39;s a pretty original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a mad-raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. It\&#39;s also revealed that he\&#39;s actually more of a Father Damien sort of messiah who\&#39;s only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the freaky guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I\&#39;m pretty sure John Turturro\&#39;s character in &#34;Mr. Deeds&#34; was inspired by Richards\&#39;s role here.&#39;,
   &#39;Too bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to put this together. There\&#39;s a lot of action, a lot of promise, but it all comes off hokey. The director didn\&#39;t do his job. Promising action comes off lame. So much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of &#34;The Rage&#34; (DirecTV credits it as 1996) simply isn\&#39;t worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done a better job.&#39;,
   &#39;Well, on it\&#39;s credit side (if it can be said to have one), Timothy Hines DID manage to capture the original setting of H.G. Wells\&#39; outstanding novella. But other than that - well, to call a spade a spade - it sucks bigtime. What the Master Ed Wood could have done with the alleged $20 million dollar budget! Timothy Hines really does make Mr. Wood, who was a flawed genius anyway, look like the best filmmaker of all time. The special effects (I guess you\&#39;d call them that) are not even up to computer game standards. The acting is, well, perhaps about dinner theater comparable, and the accents are atrocious. At the risk of sounding offensive, a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is (especially Poor Ogilvy), well, ahem, . . . GAY! Poor Ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus English countryside, waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor. Hey, the Stormtroopers in &#34;Star Wars&#34; had neat white body armor too, and it didn\&#39;t work either, they still got blasted. Even when Ogilvy and Company get fried by the Martians\&#39; \&#39;Heat Ray\&#39;(?), they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance, even when they\&#39;re theoretically DEAD and reduced to skeletons, which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing. Maybe Timothy Hines rented the skeletons from Ray Harryhausen, being left over from &#34;Jason And The Argonauts&#34;. Or was it &#34;Josie And The Pussycats&#34;? I dunno. The soldiers, presumably because they\&#39;re \&#39;military\&#39;, all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode, like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him. Wow! I loved it! But the \&#39;soldiers\&#39; all looked like they were either fascist troops from the Spanish Civil War, or Boer Commandos (which would be more or less correct for the period. Perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius Hines?). Oddly enough, the character of the Curate looks exactly like he\&#39;s drawn in the original illustrations by Warwick Goble, and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting. Oh, yeah. Musn\&#39;t forget the THUNDER CHILD. In the book, the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo-ram. It was MEANT to RAM enemy ships. Yet, it\&#39;s bow was crumpled after ramming the Tinker-Toy constructed Martian War Machines, with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak, and she sank. An ironclad warship like THUNDERCHILD could\&#39;ve rammed the TITANIC and survived, but I guess the Royal Navy was bound by the same lowest-bidder constraints as our own Military. The costumes are all wrong, especially the British Army and Police uniforms, cobbled together mostly from USMC Alphas. And Timbo, in an obvious homage to Western Films Of Yore, has obviously set his movie in Wild Western England, because all his riders are using western saddles. The accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of Scottish regional accent used by Clan Macabre, and magically delicious Irish accents from County Malarky. On the credit side, and contrary to what one reviewer wrote, the only genuine, authentic feature of this Thing is the artillery. The guns are not from the Civil War, but appear to my eye and research as bona-fide British nine or 12 pounder Rifled Breach Loaders, perfectly authentic to the period. So was the ammunition shown being used. But the Artilleryman, who is a driver in the Horse Artillery, was not shown correctly driving his limber. You don\&#39;t sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team, you ride the nearside wheel horses. The Opening, using what I believe is authentic period film footage, is okay, and the score\&#39;s not bad. However, to the best of my knowledge Weybridge has never had an underground, and it certainly didn\&#39;t in 1898.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But growing up reading this novel, I am very disappointed. Even more disappointed then I was at Spielberg\&#39;s zillion dollar, special effects laden version. Maybe his version would have profited by swapping Anthony Piana for Tom Cruise, and vice versa. I have a lot more to say, but I\&#39;ll let it go at this for now: I wish somebody would make a GOOD version of &#34;War Of The Worlds&#34; that\&#39;s faithful to the original. Timmy\&#39;s vision is fine for a high school film class, or maybe I should say pretentiously stupid for a college-level film student, and about as bad, which is about the best I can say for this thing, but that\&#39;s about it. Oh, yeah. Just where DID the budget go? And what happened to Michael Caine? I\&#39;d like to hear HIS comments! I have a sneaking suspicion that Timbo &#34;Orson Wood&#34; Hines\&#39; breathtaking, bound-breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk-taking director\&#39;s ticket to cult stardom, because, I must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie, which I didn\&#39;t pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a DVD copy for me, with no malicious intent that I\&#39;ve been able to determine. I must add here that I thought Blackmoon\&#39;s dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement, but an absolute, hysterically funny (in a good way) treat to watch. I find it hard to watch Master Timbo\&#39;s version after Blackmoon. Keep it up, Tim! Make your own version of &#34;DUNE&#34;, now. It just awaits the hand of a master like you! And all you headupyourass snobs who hated Cloverfield? FORGET IT. It CANNOT BEAT TIMBO HINES ARTISTRY FOR SHEER HILARIOUS AWFULNESS! HEY GET A LIFE!TIMBO IS WORSE THAN THE MASTER ED WOOD! I KID YOU NOT!&#39;,
   &#39;No, it\&#39;s not the horror movie...This one is actually a love story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them. She loves the boxer known as &#34;One Round&#34; Jack. She loves him until the champion comes along, that is. Even though she marries One Round, she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between One Round and the champion. She comes back to One Round\&#39;s corner, just when things look their bleakest, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was very early in Hitch\&#39;s career, but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film. Although there are special film tricks, and some comedy relief, this film just does not hold up to any of his later work. It must have been extremely risqué for the time period though, with the shameless adulterous wife. That may have been the draw back in 1927. While looking through all of these old films, it is amazing how I think that they could be redone on today\&#39;s screen and really come off. Maybe I should be the one....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of Hitchcock\&#39;s films. You could fall asleep in the middle.&#39;,
   &#39;I seriously can\&#39;t believe Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, two people I LOVE, signed on to produce this crap. Tim Burton is a brilliant director, but to be honest I\&#39;ve been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations. He did produce the brilliant &#34;Nightmare Before Christmas&#34;, which is one I\&#39;ve watched multiple times, and directed movies like &#34;Beetlejuice&#34; and &#34;Sleepy Hollow&#34;, which are awesome films. Bekmambetov directed 3 films that I LOVE: Night Watch, Day Watch, and Wanted. I\&#39;ve only seen those three of his, but they prove he\&#39;s an awesome director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those two people producing one of the many reasons I was excited to see 9. So today I went to go see it at the theatre. I was so excited to finally have seen it. I had waited 7 months for the movie to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is the first time I\&#39;ve walked out of a Tim Burton-related movie and said &#34;I enjoyed almost NONE of that&#34;. I felt heartbroken to even have felt that way. I mean, with him and Bekmambetov at the production helm you\&#39;d have expected this movie to be a good watch. Right now I still can\&#39;t get over how let down I was by this movie. I hadn\&#39;t even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now, I can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie. Hell, Neil Blomkamp made an AWESOME full length remake of Alive in Joburg entitled District 9, what was so hard to get right about 9??? I really wanted to think this movie was awesome. I really did. But no, it failed on so many levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot was extremely confusing and disjointed. I had no idea what was going on, let alone what it was about. Basically it\&#39;s about a bunch of rag doll robots trying to save the earth. Well, OK, that\&#39;s what I got from it. But the writing here is extremely poor. The whole film jumps around like a 6 year old with A.D.D. telling a story. There\&#39;s this big, giant clanky monster robot that 9 awakens, causing destruction and stuff. That\&#39;s the main villain. However, what else is wrong with this movie is that EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF NOWHERE. There were too many monster robots, most of which have no logical explanation behind them. They have 0 development whatsoever. I mean, that flying pterodactyl like monster just rips out of nowhere, we have no idea where it comes out of and Acker just expects us to know what it is. What was even more retarded was that snake-like creature with the strobing eyes that hypnotize. I dare you to give that description to someone else out loud and expect them not to laugh. All of the 3 people I told about it burst out laughing. Oh and it wraps victims up and sews them inside it. I\&#39;M. NOT. KIDDING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The twist in Act III is the most retarded aspect of the whole movie. So basically 9 goes back to the room he woke up in, finds this box with a hologram from the scientist in it for 9, and he tells him that the big scary machine robot was designed to bring robot life to earth, but then evil humans use it for war, and it was supposed to help protect the earth, but then the scientist gave his life to 9 so that it could help protect the world with it. And HE ONLY MENTIONS GIVING HIS LIFE TO 9. But what about the other robots? WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO THEM???????? This is the perfect example of poor, rushed writing. There\&#39;s only one of the life taking device thingy that exists so how did the other 8 get life given to them??????? The characters are not likable at all either. They risk their lives for no reason at all. The only good character is 7. 6 annoyed me with his &#34;GO BACK TO THE SOURCE!!!!!!&#34; ramblings, 1 is an overpowering idiot, 2 we don\&#39;t know ANYTHING about, 5 kept annoying me with his &#34;Are you sure...&#34; or &#34;Can I stay here instead...?&#34; questions. And that ending? UGH. I\&#39;m glad I\&#39;m not the only one who thinks that the ending was a huge WTF moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation. Everything looks realistic and beautiful, I love the gloomy and depressing look of everything. However, beauty can\&#39;t save a good movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it\&#39;s true that this movie is very pretty looking, pretty is as pretty does, and 9 does squat. I\&#39;m sure Burton fans will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie without a doubt, in fact with his and Bekmambetov\&#39;s names being thrown around the promos, people will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie. I know I may be making a big deal out of nothing, but watching this movie made me realize how much I hate movies with unlikeable characters, nonexistent plot and just pure style over content. And this movie is one of those movies.&#39;,
   &#39;That\&#39;s the question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie &#34;What was the point?&#34; This movie was nothing but an hour and a half of confusion with completely unlikable people (not going to use the word actors) and a script that you could tell didn\&#39;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that made me laugh the most about this movie was how it said &#34;Victorian story written by&#34; which means that there was actually a script to that part of the story. The entire victorian section had no dialogue, and was just comprised of shots of a guy staring at a girl and vice versa. Making that part of the movie as scripted as a camera left on at a train station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, time for the story. It starts out with a guy sitting in a chair never once getting out of it. Oh blocking, who needs you? These newspeople come to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girls. So he starts off the story in Victorian times. and here\&#39;s how the scene goes (Guy and girl are in a field. pretty music starts to play) (guy stares at girl) (girl stares at guy) (guy stares at girl) cut back to movie. That\&#39;s pretty much all that happens for about half the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the film is incredibly awkward dialogue about a bunch of models wanting to buy an apartment. So this real estate agent shows them one and when i say the dialogue is awkward i mean, if it were a dancer it would trip during the MACARENA. None of the characters in this movie are likable. The models are incredibly irritating, the victorian people don\&#39;t talk, and the guy telling the story has the personality of a sack of onions. So eventually all the girls get killed off. and by killed off, i mean drug offscreen. ooh. you showed ONE death? and by death i mean holding her face till they put the blood makeup on? awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW this guy even knows this story baffles me. He says it\&#39;s because he saw it. but how? there was no guy in that apartment! the door was locked shut with no way out, the windows were attached to a fire escape that was too rotten to work, how the HELL did he see all that? Oh plot holes. we DO love you. So the movie finishes up with the newswoman saying &#34;i think you made it up. you\&#39;re wasting our time&#34; despite the fact that she begged him for the interview in the first place. Whatever. This movie was stupid, pointless, and made no sense with a lot of plot holes. I could go on and on about this movie, but i don\&#39;t see the need. i\&#39;d much rather spend my time doing something uselful. Like widdle something. &#34;Hell\&#39;s Threshold&#34; more belongs in purgatory with 2 dumb models. out of 10.&#39;,
   &#34;This is not a very good telling of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff! Bo Derek in &#39;10&#39; was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than soft porn. If you&#39;re into that, well, then fast forward to it and skip the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show off her terrible acting. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; this was one of his few mistakes! don&#39;t waste your time on this movie...go buy the book instead.&#34;,
   &#39;I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid (even before Tolkien). I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to &#34;Fabio on the beach&#34; in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were actually decent, trying to make the best of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O\&#39;Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn\&#39;t even hold a candle to them. Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege. I wouldn\&#39;t recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was (at least they got that part right).&#39;,
   &#34;There is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. Those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so evident in, among others, DAMN YANKEES!, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that those expectations might be met and then\x85. Nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy, plunges into leaden, heavy handed melodrama, with nary a chuckle to be had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance, or lack of one, in this film, but in a movie in which even the great Cary Grant frequently appears flat and wooden, attacking Parker seems unfair. Not even as bright a light as an Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering, dreary and wholly pointless script, which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer&#39;s interest and patience down with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings, but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation. The desperate, inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film&#39;s final moments only serves to add insult to injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is nothing but a major disappointment on all levels.&#34;,
   &#34;Forgive me for stating the obvious, but some films are good and some films are bad. Of course, there are extremes within those two broad categories. Films such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply don&#39;t deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally however, someone produces a truly woeful film. A film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be. A film that is more than bad. Such a film is Maiden Voyage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Briefly, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil, scheming ship&#39;s owner. Of course, there is an all American hero on board, complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest, who saves the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a production that plumbs new depths. Everything about it is bad. The acting, the direction and the so-called plot are breath-takingly poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer. Even an American viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#39;s that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film. However, its dumber-than-dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb. Said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard. What would you do? I don&#39;t know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as I possibly could into the sea. Not this guy. He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate (for him) results. Enough said. Such a demise would merit a mention in the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team&#39;s lives.&#34;,
   &#39;When you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member, you know you\&#39;re in for a bad ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in with very, very low expectations, having read some of the other comments, and was not let down. Unlike some other cheap and failed movies, however, this one doesn\&#39;t really remain hilariously (and unintentionally) funny throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-SPOILERS FOLLOW-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, plot it very inconsistent. Looking past the &#34;small&#34; mistakes, such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours, the whole idea it\&#39;s based on is messed up. See, the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites which really were dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show some peasant poking at one with his pitchfork and the dragon pops out. Later, the obligatory &#34;crazy scientist&#34; guy babbles on about how dragons outlived the dinosaurs. So apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were, or we just have a fine little plot hole here. The other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force &#34;half as strong&#34; as what was used for Hiroshima. Then two guys later walk in to check everything out, and it\&#39;s almost unscathed! There\&#39;s even another dragon, which grew out of who knows what. All in all it\&#39;s very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned cloning, I guessed they\&#39;d clone a dragon. That means that our Mr. Smarty-pants security guy isn\&#39;t so intuitive and smart as the movie would have you believe, if you ignore that I knew this film would be about, you know, dragons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting that aside, the second worst thing is the &#34;special effects.&#34; Others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning, the CG helicopter, and the dragon. It looks a bit better than a blob, but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it trudged down the hall in the same manner time after time. To their credit, the flying dragons in the beginning looked OK from far away (although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie.) These things are funny to watch, however. The scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not. Nor are the &#34;introduction&#34; screens with the vital stats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming to the actors, they weren\&#39;t the greatest, but I guess at least they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors participating in the recent &#34;BloodRayne,&#34; for example, and you\&#39;ve got to give them points for that. One thing I noticed though was that the woman who plays Meredith often had her face covered in make-up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her. She looked like she had a bad run-in with some white-face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script is bad and cheesy. You don\&#39;t really notice the music, but it\&#39;s actually not too bad for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is don\&#39;t watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it\&#39;s bad (like I did), although the only funny things are the bad CG effects. Other than that, don\&#39;t waste your time and money.&#39;,
   &#39;Maria Bello doesn\&#39;t seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles. Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in. Maybe she needs those movies, to get off the sugar coated (aka &#34;Hollywood&#34;) ones she does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think fails to achieve what it sets out to do (I won\&#39;t spoil that), Maria Bello is as great as in her other independent/small movies she stars in. It\&#39;s her performance that elevates this movie. This combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some flaws, like bad pacing and dramaturgy), the movie is still too long&#39;,
   &#34;How do you spell washed up fat Italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication? In this movie we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment- since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career. In this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is fat, slow and very old looking in this movie, hardly a martial arts action hero, more like a laughing stock clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s time for Steven Seagal to retire- this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot: fat Italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response. This pretense, although pathetic and laughable, gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention this movie totally sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke? yeah. I did.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;The Screaming Skull&#34; opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there\&#39;s a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she\&#39;s going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man\&#39;s first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it\&#39;s just that the 1950\&#39;s didn\&#39;t have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. But then again, when I first saw &#34;House on Haunted Hill&#34; as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I\&#39;m sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. But there\&#39;s some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it\&#39;s own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the Whitlock\&#39;s make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! That at least made me jump out of my seat!&#39;,
   &#39;Joe Don Baker. He was great in &#34;Walking Tall&#34; and had a good bit-part in &#34;Goldeneye&#34;, but here in &#34;Final Justice&#34; all hope is gone...the dark side has won. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was on MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker\&#39;s ample flesh and skewer this flick completely. It\&#39;s obvious they were just beginning with &#34;Mitchell&#34; on their anti-Joe Don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes for a funny experience, though: there are plenty of choice riffs. My favorites - &#34;John Rhys-Davies for sale&#34;, &#34;It\&#39;s \&#39;Meatloaf: Texas Ranger\&#39;&#34;, &#34;none of them are sponge-worthy&#34;, &#34;Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed&#34;, and my favorite - &#34;\&#39;Son of a...\&#39;? What? What was he the son of: son of a PREACHER MAN?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By itself, &#34;Final Justice&#34; is, as Joe Don puts it in the movie, &#34;a big fat nada&#34;. But here, it actually has some entertainment value. You get a chance, catch THIS version of &#34;Final Justice&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for &#34;Final Justice&#34;. Ten for the MST3K version ONLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don\&#39;s in town.&#39;,
   &#34;I think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It does have the interesting fact of taking place in Cambodia. How many American made films of the 30&#39;s take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the conflict there is a little hard to figure out. Even the troop movements are a little confusing. What drags it to a resounding halt is the love story. Why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde I don&#39;t know. I thought he should continue to use his Zombies (such as they are) and forget all about her. The movie just plods along. The perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept. I thought they would never get there. One guy takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is insufferable. By the way, a more apt title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized.&#34;,
   &#39;I had no expectations other than to be entertained for 90 minutes, and that is exactly what I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it is campy, of course some of the dialog wasn\&#39;t perfect, of course the &#34;special effects&#34; were a bit hokey. That is exactly why I enjoyed the movie so much. It is a perfect fit for this genre of a 70\&#39;s Horror classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talent needs to start some where, that goes for the actors and the crew, and what better piece of material to sharpen your skills on than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one look forward to another film from these producers and directors.&#39;,
   &#34;After seeing MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS I am still convinced that the first decent movie about (teenage) witches yet has to be made. I didn&#39;t think much of THE CRAFT and I&#39;m not into CHARMED either. The only film I more or less enjoyed (about teenage witches) was LITTLE WITCHES (1996), and even that one wasn&#39;t very good. But changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies, you will also enjoy MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80&#39;s movie about teenage witches in high school. But I was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious. The acting is decent and serious all the time. No jokes are being played by teenagers or something. And the musical score, at first, I thought was pretty good. It added some scariness and also something &#39;classy&#39;, with the use of threatening violins and all. But as the movie progressed I came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious. They didn&#39;t have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#39;s Melissa Sue Anderson, who was the main reason for me to see this movie. A few weeks ago, I saw her in HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME, a rather enjoyable, thick-plotted (and goofy on some occasions) slasher-movie which she had done in the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS. And I must say, she was very good as the icy-cold bad witch Vivian. But the main problem with the movie is: almost nothing happens! Vivian causes a death and an accident, yes, but that&#39;s it. Then there&#39;s Robin, the good witch, who is just learning about her powers. And we expect the two of them using their powers more than once, but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles. That was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches? And what&#39;s worse, I was hoping to see a spectacular show-down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects, flaming eyes or whatever... but nothing happens. There is sort of a confrontation in the end, but it&#39;s a big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the acting of the two witches was good. The musical score was decent (even though overly ambitious). And the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times. But that doesn&#39;t make a good movie yet, does it?&#34;,
   &#34;This was a blind buy used DVD. It totally killed a nice buzz I had going when I hit play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s bubble-headed comedy, but it&#39;s um. squalid. The plot is ZANY!, but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived I ultimately found it depressing to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven, goofy caper film. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box &amp; the Academy Award nomination mean nothing.)&#34;,
   &#34;Imagine The Big Chill with a cast of twenty-somethings whose characters are all unlikable, and an iguana-like man-lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the foolishness herein. On the positive side, the movie does not skimp on showing the monster. There&#39;s no peek-a-boo shots, or nighttime scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like; he&#39;s right out there folks. Unfortunately, the design and construction aren&#39;t that inspired. A little bit of mystery might have helped. Mind you, I&#39;ve seen far worse, but if you&#39;re going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick, your monster better look damn good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiler Ahead!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and there&#39;s a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. This came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script. As for the acting; well let&#39;s just say it wasn&#39;t painfully bad, but I don&#39;t expect we&#39;ll be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic outings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gore quotient: 2 out of 5; Nudity quotient: 1 out of 5; Intelligence quotient: Negligible&#34;,
   &#34;Unfortunately, one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering, silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate, clichéd screenplay. Hollow Man is a rather useless film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practically everything seen here has been done to death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the lift shaft!) - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects. However, it is just the same special effect done over and over again, and by the end of the film that has been done to death also. I was hoping before watching Hollow Man that the Invisible Man theme, which is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. This is not so. It isn&#39;t long before the film turns into an overly-familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics - the mound of clichés piles up so fast that it&#39;s almost impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best. Good points might be a passable Jerry Goldsmith score (but no competition for his better efforts), a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects. I was tempted to give this film three out of ten, but the effects push Hollow Man&#39;s merit up one notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#34;,
   &#39;When this movie was first shown on television I had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about World War I as experienced by American soldiers. Unfortunately this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should have been a good movie about WWI. Even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props. But the writing and directing are badly lacking, even though the makers of this movie obviously borrowed freely from quite a few well made war movies. War movie clichés abound such as the arrogant general who apparently does not care a flip about the lives of his men. When will Hollywood realize that, even though there have been plenty of bad generals, most combat unit generals have seen plenty of combat themselves and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences? The first part of this movie appeared to be &#34;Paths of Glory&#34; with American uniforms. Except that &#34;Paths of Glory&#34; was emotionally gripping. Later on there was Chamberlain\&#39;s charge (except uphill) from &#34;Gettysburg&#34; and even the capture of the American soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from &#34;The Thin Red Line&#34;. But in &#34;The Thin Red Line&#34; the soldier was alone when captured. In this movie a ring forms around the new prisoner in the middle of a battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this movie used a military adviser they ignored him. Even though the actors (and I never could forget they were actors while watching) mouthed military tactics I didn\&#39;t see very much of it. The American soldiers would stand up to be shot while the Germans attacked. And the infamous Storm Troopers, who were apparently blind, appeared to use no tactics whatsoever in their attack. In the real war, the tactics were what made storm troopers so effective. But the silliest scene was the attack of the German Flamethrowers. In this scene the German flamethrower operators walked in a broad line towards the defending Americans. If that had been real they would never have gotten close enough to use their flamethrowers before they had all been dropped by the defender\&#39;s bullets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown. But it is still disappointing. But what really turned me off to this flick was the typical anti-war anti-military angle that movie makers seem to think is important. True, war is hell. But most American soldiers, even though they grumble and gripe, tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather gung-ho about it. My Grandfather served in World War I. And even though he died four years before I was born I have been told how proud he was of his service.&#39;,
   &#39;This film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill &#34;wonder of the human body&#34; documentaries by bravely, if bizarrely, opting to elicit disgust in the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it. In another, the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo. In a final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of...teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately, I\&#39;m not making any of this up. See this film if you must, but: bring your vomit bag, and don\&#39;t have pasta salad beforehand.&#39;,
   &#39;I hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case I feel like I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There, I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury.&#34; That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers take it no further. Those who encounter the &#34;curse&#34; are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of, creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film(s), valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour \x96 by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. It pretty much unfolds like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-person walks into house&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-person goes to investigate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-sound starts to get loud&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-person sees a ghost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-loud scream and/or cat screech&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cut to black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the audience is even given a hint of plot, this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. By the time the end of the film rolled around, my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end &#34;with a loud scream and a cut to black.&#34; We were never proved wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has no liner storyline, instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason. I haven\&#39;t seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death, how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $15 million its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the &#34;scariest movie ever made.&#34; I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?&#39;,
   &#34;this film has its good points: hot chicks people die&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the problem... the hot Chicks barley get nude and you don&#39;t get to see many of the people dieing, mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also for those of you watching this for JENNA JAMESON she is just a side chearator with a very small role and Minor nude scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this film needed.. script and story would be nice but I will not complain about that.. simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#39;t waste my money on it...and if you must, wait until it&#39;s on the OLD shelves at your local video store&#34;,
   &#34;I read the book a long time back and don&#39;t specifically remember the plot but do remember that I enjoyed it. Since I&#39;m home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It is a Lifetime movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is populated with grade B actors and actresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The female cast is right out of Desperate Housewives. I&#39;ve never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the gist. Is there nothing original anymore? Sure, but not on Lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one scene a female is struggling with a male, for her life, and what does she do??? Kicks him in the testicles. What else? Women love that but let me tell you girls something... It&#39;s not as easy as it&#39;s always made to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#39;t all bad. I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that.&#34;,
   &#34;A scientist (John Carradine--sadly) finds out how to bring the dead back to life. However they come back with faces of marble. Eventually this all leads to disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boring, totally predictable 1940s outing. This scared me silly when I was a kid but just bores me now. I had to struggle to stay awake! With one exception, the acting is horrible. Such expressionless boring actors! Hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. And there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane walking through walls. There&#39;s also one of the worst-looking knockouts in cinema history. Still, none of this is fun enough to sit through this. Avoid.&#34;,
   &#34;Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie. This flick doesn&#39;t have enough plot for half an hour, yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, specially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade.&#34;,
   &#34;Much has been made of Rohmer&#39;s use of digital technology to &#39;fill in&#39; the background. At times it works well, the scene where Grace and her maid witness from afar the King&#39;s execution is particularly striking. At other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look, resembling a home video. However, the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer. We know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters? To be frank, I did not care at all what happened to the Lady or the Duke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other major failing, I regret to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role. She is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance. OK she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion. Her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend Mme de Meyler (an excellent performance by the debutante Helena Dubiel) seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience. Also, watch her hands when she is expressing emotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very disappointing film, particularly given the positive reviews on this site.&#34;,
   &#39;I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal (and still have my DS:TMOB poster autographed by him) at a convention shortly after the release, and asked him why he chose to do the film &#34;camp&#34;. Before he could answer, two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio &#34;knew best&#34; and how &#34;no one will take such a film seriously&#34;. I had been reading the Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon attendees of the 1970s will recall Blackhawk and his band? I was in a couple of years of that with him), and had higher hopes than what we got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously, and so doing \&#39;camp\&#39; was the only way. Several other fans jumped in on my side, with Pal listening as best he could. At the end of the little event, Pal came up to us and apologized, wishing he could have done more and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAR WARS put the lie to the flacks, and a year after Pal\&#39;s death, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise...if it hadn\&#39;t been for the flacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tear out the memory or history of Doc, and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doc Savage can still come to the screen, and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill-informed to Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the First American Superhero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it\&#39;s a lot more serious. Yes, there was simultaneous footage shot, but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors. And, yes, there _is_ a one-sheet of Ron Ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol. Ely\&#39;s wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie, and the words &#34;DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL...Coming Next Summer!&#34; POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for the convention, smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are. At the time, they were doing dorkknobs and Fu Manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants, and carrying Paramount portfolios.&#39;,
   &#34;Boy, this was one lousy movie! While I haven&#39;t seen all of the Burton/Taylor collaborations, I can say with confidence that this is the worst. This rich but ill woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Meditteranean, ruling over a put-upon staff when she&#39;s suddenly visited by this traveling poet, who mouths platitudes. In fact, the whole film is just a talk fest, with much of the talk making no sense. Even in 1968, no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense, and the passage of time makes that even more clear. If it weren&#39;t for the beautiful cinematography and scenery, it would deserve a negative rating. The only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars.&#34;,
   &#39;It\&#39;s interesting how 90% of the high-vote reviews are all comprised of &#34;*random username*&#34; from &#34;United States&#34; (no state pride??) who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies. I would delve further into this suspicious trend, but alas, this is a review of the movie, and not the reviews themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a true avid movie fan. This means I have seen a great many movies, from good to bad, and can wholeheartedly claim that Facing The Giants is, in fact, NOT a good movie. It has good intentions, but fails to meet many (if any) basic standards that I associate with a quality filmgoing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Acting: Mostly Terrible, Palatable At Best. Hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dialogue: Clumsy, cheesy, the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you\&#39;d see performed in Sunday School or youth group function. The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of &#34;meaningless words&#34;, but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world, and the complete absence of it is palpable. Let\&#39;s just say the mean ol\&#39; head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have a lot more to say than &#34;OH NO!&#34; when things are not going his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plot: Mind-bogglingly predictable. It has been commented that this movie is &#34;not a Hollywood cliché&#34;, and yet it\&#39;s like it was pulled directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies) and just had a Christian-themed coat of paint slapped on it. I\&#39;m not lying or bragging when I say I had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception. Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Directing/Editing: It, too, was patterned almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie template. Still, acting aside, there weren\&#39;t many noticeable goofs, so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Message: Ask Jesus and He will grant all your wishes. Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team\&#39;s eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole &#34;If we lose, we praise You&#34; part, because in the Real World, you WILL fail at one point or another and it\&#39;s good to be prepared for that. But in the world of Facing The Giants, if you fail, clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating. Another interesting question being, what if the Eagles came across another team that had gotten religion? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last-minute saves, or would the universe simply have exploded? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line: For the hardcore conservative Christian Parents crowd lamenting the evils of Hollywood, Facing The Giants will be another mediocre-at-best Christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film-making. For everyone else, the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else. And a warning: Any attempt to show this to non-Christians will lead not to conversion, but to derision. I give this two stars, one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes, and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget.&#39;,
   &#39;This documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of Betty Page\&#39;s(Paige Richards) career. The Tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950\&#39;s and was fetish photos, bondage and cat-fight &#34;girly flicks&#34;. Irving Klaw(Dukey Flyswatter)at his Movie Star News instructed Betty on what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous photos or &#34;stag films&#34;, but nonetheless, Klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution. It is no surprise that Betty had a cult following at the height of her career. The girl-next-door with jet black hair, blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades. After all, it has been said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This movie actually could have been a lot better; but good enough to hold interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Richards is stunning in her own right. Bra, panties, garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least. Also in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Be advised this movie can change your heart rate.&#39;,
   &#34;In all of low budget history. this movie has to be one of the worst. True ther are some humorous sides to the movie, but in general it was just plain awful. I just can&#39;t understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs. I mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man. This was rather amusing.&#34;,
   &#34;In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue chasing the Tall Man, assisted by a trigger-happy 9 year old, a black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike&#39;s deceased brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in Phantasm II. I got the feeling the stress was merely laid on Reggie&#39;s incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand-up comedian. The humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed, which fits a story like this better. Also, the settings aren&#39;t as macabre here, plus the constant presence of the Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) isn&#39;t as obvious\x85 There still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time. By the way, beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off-screen. The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed 4 episodes so far\x85the fifth being in production. The first one is a semi-cult classic, the second is a horror-feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, even though James LeGros portrayed his character a lot better in Phantasm II.&#34;,
   &#39;Raising Victor Vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be: being real. Unfortunately, there is no reality to this film. The characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason? Bad directing. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems Mr. Sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel. Wrong! It just gives it a badly-made feel. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film, it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what\&#39;s on screen instead of enhance it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, what\&#39;s on screen is so painfully fake, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look &#34;hip&#34; to his Sundance buddies and show how &#34;edgy&#34; a filmmaker he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director Mr. Sollett is. Next time, how about taking a few writing and directing classes?&#39;,
   &#39;William Hurt scuba diving scientist??? US agents running the investigation abroad? The sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper missing and not killing Hurt (just wounding him) but the second &#34;kill&#34; shot is dead on ? Waste of time. To compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous. Oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the &#34;evil&#34; agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the &#34;virus handshake&#34;. What? BTW...when did IMDb require 10 lines of text? I\&#39;m just babbling here. Doesn\&#39;t this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines?&#39;,
   &#39;What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean firstly I love Seagal. I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s. His early stuff is some of the best in the genre. This however does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical one-liner ass kicking form. However, what we get is a crime mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There\&#39;s people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug. What happened in this movie. The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace, a shambles and a shame. Why dub the man? The story is terrible. This got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him, and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera! &#34;Revenge is a two way street&#34; seagal says in this movie...well forget revenge Steven, you need redemption!&#39;,
   &#34;Gene Hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination. It&#39;s a given of course that Hackman has the proficient skills for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody tells him anything though, he&#39;s given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information. That&#39;s supposed to be suspenseful, instead it&#39;s annoying and boring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hackman goes through with the mission, but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up. So everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don&#39;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit. Maybe something really was lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very talented cast that had people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert is so thoroughly wasted here it&#39;s a crime. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even the IRS.&#34;,
   &#34;Saw a trailer for this on another video, and decided to rent when it came out. Boy, was I disappointed! The story is extremely boring, the acting (aside from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I couldn&#39;t care less about the characters, aside from really wanting to see Nora&#39;s husband get thrashed. Christopher Walken&#39;s role is such a throw-away, what a tease!&#34;,
   &#34;The show&#39;s echoed &#39;bubbling&#39; sound effect used to put me to sleep. A very soothing show. I think I might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril. I had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would assume Lloyd Bridges never dove there. I only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge-of-the-seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother&#39;s house... imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads. I thought &#39;Flipper&#39; had better undersea action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.&#34;,
   &#39;This was a crappy movie, with a whole lotta non-sense and too many loose-ends to count. I only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors (Ron Livingston) made a cameo in it, and I continued watching it because as a girl, I love any movie that includes male nudity for a change. Later, I found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get, and each time it got...more... ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean Crawley (good-looking Chris L. McKenna, whom I\&#39;ve never seen before - but LOVED his little nude scene)is making ends meet as a painter, when he meets electrician Duke Wayne (George Wendt from &#34;Cheers&#34;). Thinking he\&#39;s getting more work from Duke, Sean agrees to meet contractor Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin, playing a stereotypically evil guy). Ray is being investigated by a City Hall accountant (Ron Livingston in a cameo, who I\&#39;ve been in love with from &#34;Office Space&#34; up to &#34;Sex &amp; the City&#34;). Ray end up offering the apparently desperate-for- cash Sean $13k to kill the accountant, and Sean accepts the job. Sean stalks out the accountant, whose wife (Kari Wuhrer) he finds himself attracted to, completes the hit, and leaves - taking the file of information against Ray with him. Sean quickly learns he was being used, that Ray never intended to pay him, and Sean uses the file as leverage to get his money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to this point, it\&#39;s a descent flick...generally worth watching. But as soon as Ray, Duke and their crew kidnap Sean to muscle the information about the file out of him, it just got dumber and dumber (and still DUMBER...), until finally it seemed like the film\&#39;s writer, Charlie Higson, had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something. Without simply detailing the movie, let\&#39;s just say that in every-single-scene you watch after the kidnapping, you find yourself gasping &#34;what the f**K!,&#34; baffled by the ongoing nonsense as Sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption. In the end, so many loose-ends are left in the movie, that you begin to regret that you even watched it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable, and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it\&#39;s full value. It\&#39;s supposed to be a psychological thriller, and McKenna is a decent actor, but it\&#39;s hard to give yourself to the movie when you have &#34;Norm&#34; from &#34;Cheers&#34; and a Baldwin brother doing the dirty work, and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense. Guys will love the violence, blood and guts scenes, and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots. Girls will enjoy handsome Sean\&#39;s gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie, when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie. Personally, I hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks (Ron Livingston) is only in the first one-third of the movie.&#39;,
   &#34;Visually disjointed and full of itself, the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an 81 minute snore-fest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moments that work in this film are VERY limited, and the characters don&#39;t even feel real. How could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Substantively AND stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. Jarring irregular camera work, awkward silences and gaps in action, and what&#39;s with the little spider image crawling across the screen? Whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school. It added no meaning, just cheese, and didn&#39;t even stylistically work with the rest of the film (assuming the film even had a style, which is a close call). What a flop.&#34;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with Maltin on this one. This is a second rate, excessively vicious Western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the Wild West being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time. It would like to be in the tradition of &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#34;, but lacks that film\&#39;s poignancy and charm. Andrew McLaglen\&#39;s direction is limp, and the final 30 minutes or so are a real botch, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire.) There was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman\&#39;s reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true. Coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge, but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped (they\&#39;re like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward). Michael Parks gives one of his typically shifty, lethargic, mumbling performances, but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about.&#39;,
   &#34;Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy-drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility, and growing old. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) which causes him to seek out his estranged father (Alan King), a movie-extra who fancies himself a big star. The script is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one-liners galore, a flat, inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and family-conflict at the ready. Crystal and King try their best, but King is over-eager and frequently over-the-top. JoBeth Williams has another one of her thankless roles, but manages to bring her innate, down-home class to the proverbial girlfriend character. It&#39;s a comedy, I guess, but one that blinks back the tears...shamefully. ** from ****&#34;,
   &#39;You don\&#39;t expect much from a PRC picture, and with rare exceptions--mainly from Edgar G. Ulmer and a few by Joseph H. Lewis or Lew Landers--that\&#39;s exactly what you get: not much. This &#34;epic&#34; about Nazis in Africa trying to incite an Arab revolt against the British isn\&#39;t much different. The script, by longtime PRC hacks Arthur St. Claire and Sherman Lowe, is trite, laughable, full of unfunny &#34;wisecracks&#34; and plot holes the size of Outer Mongolia. The direction, by longtime PRC no-budget specialist Al Herman, is semi-comatose at best. The performances, though--except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead Walter Woolf King--aren\&#39;t really half bad. Veteran comedian Parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film. He plays a guy from Brooklyn masquerading as a razor-blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up. He\&#39;s got great comic timing, charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time. Duncan Renaldo is fairly convincing as an Arab sheik--despite his Spanish accent--and veteran bad guy George J. Lewis as Renaldo\&#39;s Arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy, even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes. Joan Woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch, and she and Renaldo have great chemistry together, although--like the rest of the cast--she has none at all with King. H.B. Warner, whose career stretched back to the silent era, lends a shred of dignity to the low-rent proceedings, even though he blows his lines several times and, PRC being PRC, they weren\&#39;t cut out. There\&#39;s a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big-budget silent movie with a similar Arab theme--although I have no idea which one it is--and, PRC being PRC, no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous: I\&#39;ve seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;A Yank in Libya&#34; isn\&#39;t very good, of course--well, OK, it stinks--but it would be worth a look just to see Parkyakarkus in his prime. I had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor/director Albert Brooks and Super Dave Osborne, but had never actually seen him in anything before. It was worth watching this tenth-rate PRC &#34;extravaganza&#34; just to see him in action. Otherwise, forget it.&#39;,
   &#39;The best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of Sonny Chiba, this movie gives you lots of him. Chiba makes speeches; Chiba poses; Chiba sneers; Chiba glares at the camera; Chiba punches and kicks the living sushi out of a whole bunch of bad guys; Chiba sits around on couches and chairs and looks thoughtful/pensive; Chiba drives his car...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy Chiba as an actor and a martial artist...but even for a Chiba fan, this movie may have a little too much Sonny Chiba. It\&#39;s obviously something of a vanity vehicle for him. And no, I wouldn\&#39;t put &#34;Street Fighter&#34; in the same category, because in &#34;SF&#34; he plays a ruthless, amoral anti-hero and he shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and foes. Here, he\&#39;s front and center almost all the time, and he tries to be Batman, Captain America and Bruce Lee rolled into one. Toshiro Mifune and Chow Yun Fat couldn\&#39;t pull this off for the length of an entire feature film, and Sonny just kind of wears out his welcome. At least he could have changed out of his suit once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is further messed up by an entirely gratuitous and badly done introductory sequence (apparently tacked on to the front of the film for the American version) and a goofy cheer &#34;(&#34;Viva!! Chiba!! Viva!! Chiba!!) that starts things on the wrong foot. There is some astoundingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing - Sonny (or his usual English stand-in) apparently couldn\&#39;t be bothered to do the vocals for the American version, so they got some poor dope with an entirely different and smoother voice and dialect that is quite jarring coming from the face we all know and love from &#34;Street Fighter&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with all those flaws and the overexposure, this could still be a minor classic, but the camera work and the fight scenes are hopelessly cheesy. I\&#39;m willing to believe that Karate actually works if someone as amazing as Chiba\&#39;s character is supposed to be does it, but the director and cameraman hedged their bets by chopping and editing fight scenes with a weed whacker so you can\&#39;t really see what\&#39;s going on most of the time. It\&#39;s not all bad: there are some decent shots and compositions, and there\&#39;s at least one memorable and nightmarish moment when the bad guys appear in the client\&#39;s bedroom in a genuinely inventive way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the actual plot...forget it. For a &#34;bodyguard&#34;, Chiba\&#39;s character is something of an idiot. The screenplay depends on his making mistakes and oversights that repeatedly place him (and his &#34;client&#34;) in perilous situations so he can fight his way out of them, and after 30 minutes, it strains even the most credulous judgment to think that this guy is supposed to be any good. (Also, If his character was really out to destroy the Japanese drug trade, he\&#39;d have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and shaken her until her teeth chattered like a castanet until she spilled her little secrets...and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel. It\&#39;s still Sonny Chiba, and he\&#39;s still fun to watch. I paid a buck to get this off the bargain DVD rack at a local mega mart, and I feel it was worth watching once.&#39;,
   &#34;There&#39;s only one thing I need to say about this movie - the scene where Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra&#39;s character about wanting to be a genie; never see this movie. The story is horrible, the acting is terrible (c&#39;mon, it&#39;s Shaq!) and I&#39;d rather see Capra in Free Willy (equally horrible) twice before ever seeing this movie.&#34;,
   &#39;*Spoilers* Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead he lends them justification. The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. Engaging in vicious stereotyping, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-English speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using American-Indian - because they\&#39;re trendy, dude? Let\&#39;s make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese clerks and &#34;hicks&#34; are uncool, so let\&#39;s make it seem like the deserve to die. Instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the &#34;reality&#34; in the film. There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. The film\&#39;s &#34;message&#34; is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. The clever message is nowhere to be seen.&#39;,
   &#39;Oh, CGI. A blessing when used properly. A sin with it\&#39;s used by people who have no idea what their doing. Sadly, that\&#39;s not the only thing that\&#39;s used poorly in this umpteen Jaws rip-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low-budget horror movies. And 2: If there is a cute guy in said low-budget movie, I\&#39;ll usually point them out. So, let\&#39;s just get this out of the way right now. This is one low-budget horror movie I didn\&#39;t like. The acting, for the most part, is horrible, effects laughable, and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I\&#39;ve witnessed this year. As far as the resident cute boy...Dax Miller (Bog) wins that prize hands down. This boy is hot! And surprisingly, he\&#39;s not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt...he can actually act (well, as much as he can in this odious film). Now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way, let\&#39;s get on with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Cliff Notes version, here\&#39;s the story (don\&#39;t worry, I\&#39;ll try not to give anything away)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers (established cute boy and his buddy) who surf with sharks. Unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island. Croc shows up, mayhem ensues, and people are eaten. Roll end credits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said earlier, this film pretty much blows. It started pretty well, but soon devolved into being silly and stupid. A main character becomes lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining heros utter one-liners at the victims expense. Also, if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water, what\&#39;s with all the sharks around? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat, I don\&#39;t think a few skimpy sharks would stick around. The FX is some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see. The CGI is horrendous, and they\&#39;ve even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Store. The Croc Hunter. They know what crocodiles look like. You obviously didn\&#39;t reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film. And what\&#39;s with the pirate/drug pusher gang? Did you just need another reason to rip off a woman\&#39;s top? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s funny how we get little sub-genres in the movie world. With Alligator and it\&#39;s sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, it now looks like &#34;over-sized crocodile/alligator&#34; movies should now get their own category at Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Tobe Hooper\&#39;s Crocodile was good. Blood Surf, sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grade: D-&#39;,
   &#39;No laughs whatsoever. Yes, I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn\&#39;t later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (No, he had not.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that British &#34;humor&#34; included black &#34;jokes&#34; like these, thirty years ago. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers\&#39; comments, which acknowledge this isn\&#39;t very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one, then I certainly pity your torturous existences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy repeated &amp; drawn-out double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to \&#39;77), and other &#34;low&#34; humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work. This however is sloughed off schlock. I fear that it IS the end of civilization, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile. Next you\&#39;ll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular. :(&#39;,
   &#34;This TV movie goes to show that bad films do exist. The only reason I saw this was it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. It&#39;s Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing. With the many stars in this film, it made no difference. I really don&#39;t know why I watched this.&#34;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m a big mark for the music of Neil Young, and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many alt-indie press circles, hit the first showing of Greendale I could find. My excitement was short-lived, as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neil says the film started as a soundtrack, and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to craft a story. No character really has an arc, and when &#34;significant&#34; events do happen, the viewer doesn\&#39;t cared, because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point. The film is all song, and to that end, the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they\&#39;re sung...the technique works for the first stanza it is done, and is grating on the nerves after that. It doesn\&#39;t feel real or fake, it just feels unwelcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible acting, with characters finding one mood and playing all of it. Poor lighting at times. The only kudos I can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast, but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it. An alright soundtrack, but nothing I\&#39;m quick to buy. A bad film.&#39;,
   &#39;This is the worst brain damaged, ultra cheap, super stupid, silly, pointless piece of trash I\&#39;ve ever seen, an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre. If you think that Ed Wood\&#39;s &#34;Plan 9&#34; is bad, well... let me tell you, looks like &#34;Citizen Kane&#34; compared to that one. ¿Special effects?...again, &#34;Plan 9&#34; is &#34;Star Wars&#34;. ¿Acting?...Thor Johnson is Al Pacino... so it\&#39;s beyond bad, really. But if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies, it\&#39;s for you! I\&#39;m a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies, the Price-Corman-Poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with &#34;Star Creatures&#34; they descend right down to the Z level. Of course, my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an Indian chief is great) so have fun and enjoy... if you can.&#39;,
   &#34;I cant believe some people actually like this. Yet still call themselves Batman fans. Even going as far as to say it&#39;s better than BTAS. Which it&#39;s not. It should be plagiarism for them to use Batman&#39;s name for this piece of crap. It&#39;s not Batman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole premise of the show is &#39;&#39;if you cant defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help you&#39;&#39; Batman isn&#39;t all about weapons. He uses his batarang and grappling hook and Batmobile, thats it. He doesn&#39;t come up with some new ingenious tech every time he cant beat someone. I don&#39;t know where the hell they got the idea for a Batbot. or whatever. They have ruined all the villains. Mr. Freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell in some cryofreezing thing. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft. tall top hat. The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface making the Dummy the whole centerpiece for the character. They even got a dumb idea to make him a giant! wtf? and the two worst character changes are that of The Joker and Riddler. they have changed Riddler to a Gothic/retro teenage freak. and The Joker to an acrobat with dreads. He looks like a bob Marley wannabe. they have completely and utterly ruined batman even moreso than B&amp;R did! i wish i could meet the creators and or writers and animators of this show so i could whack them in the head with a metal baseball bat.&#34;,
   &#34;I just sat in the theater bored as hell, i wanted to leave halfway through the movie. The plot is simple 4 Samoan guys wreck weddings. So They have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding. Yawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that peeved me off the most was the so-called crude jokes... They were highly UNfunny, clichéd and thrown in your face, to make you get into the already dull movie. The acting was below-average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, one of the worse movies i&#39;ve seen of 2006, unfunny, bad acting, just ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well thank god a friend shouted me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.&#34;,
   &#39;As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would rather get a root canal than view this film again. The use of stereotyping, uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story-line and bad script. The writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is non-native, they need to seriously re-examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are intentionally being ignorant. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Native films then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.&#39;,
   &#39;Okay, let\&#39;s not get confused here. If this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic, does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic\&#39;s sequel? Here\&#39;s to hoping that\&#39;s not a general rule, as Wes Craven\&#39;s own sequel to the original &#34;The Hills have Eyes&#34; \x96 released somewhere during the mid-80\&#39;s \x96 is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made. Part two didn\&#39;t have an actual plot and re-used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise. Craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories, as the loyal German Shepard of the Carter family re-experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies. There were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well. The remake came out barely one year ago and here\&#39;s the sequel already? The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script. Don\&#39;t they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary, menacing and disturbing? With his excellent film, Alexandre Aja nearly single-handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes, as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for. Also, Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic &#34;High Tension&#34;, but who is this new director? Aja\&#39;s &#34;The Hills Have Eyes&#34; was an unexpected hit, appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over-enthusiast target groups. It\&#39;s a really good film and, even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable, it\&#39;s highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Aja\&#39;s smashing hit. Bearing all this in mind, plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism, I must admit this rushed sequel really isn\&#39;t as awful as anticipated. The screenplay is routine and clichéd horror fodder, introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive-looking freaks. After the events of the first film, the US army has set up a camp in the middle of the New Mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests, which took place there in the 50\&#39;s and 60\&#39;s. For the horribly mutated survivors of the miner\&#39;s community that stayed there during the radioactive testing, the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck. They are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This basically is just another by-the-numbers slasher with dumb characters who are, even after losing several of their friends already, still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill. It\&#39;s also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive, especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3-year-old son. &#34;The Hills Have Eyes II&#34; completely lacks \x96 as to be expected \x96 originality, logic and plausible situations. The mutated miners aren\&#39;t nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one, mainly because they aren\&#39;t organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex-hungry prototype monsters. Since you don\&#39;t care for the amateur G.I. Joe &#34;heroes&#34; and definitely don\&#39;t feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills, this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year\&#39;s original. Most peculiarly, this second film isn\&#39;t nearly as violent and gory as the first! Sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise-twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences, but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor. There are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics \x96 mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns \x96 but there sadly aren\&#39;t any outrageous pick-axe battles or virulent dog attacks. What a shame! What\&#39;s the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and/or gratuitous filth of the original? Luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental, and you\&#39;ll have the most fun spotting all the things that don\&#39;t make the slightest bit of sense! For example, wallets falling out of people\&#39;s bloodied heads, women without any muscle power cast as tough-ass soldiers and \x96 my personal favorite \x96 assigning the ONE soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications.&#39;,
   &#39;This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The Avengers held this dubious honor\x85 but no longer. The acting in &#34;Jill the Ripper&#34; is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. It doesn\&#39;t know whether it wants to be an S&amp;M flick or a really bad thriller. Only watch under extreme intoxication or if you\&#39;re bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction. This script should be reworked into a porn, it wouldn\&#39;t take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life. A porn, even a bad porn, wouldn\&#39;t do the damage to Dolf Lundgren\&#39;s career the way that this movie has.&#39;,
   &#39;This film\&#39;s trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. However, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting &#34;comedy&#34; (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. It\&#39;s not funny, it\&#39;s almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. A film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!&#39;,
   &#39;Lets first start this review with the fact that I SIGNED UP JUST TO WRITE THE REVIEW AND WARN PEOPLE TO SAVE Their MONEY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since The Hulk. The storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with. If you are expecting 24 but on the big screen, flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket.. You may get more enjoyment that way. The acting was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic, (along with the so called &#34;twist&#34; in the end. I must say this.. The ending did surprise me. I am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me, but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the ONLY scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie. They rushed the ending so quickly that I didn\&#39;t even realize that it was over until I saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if I could just figure out how to get into that screening room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casting was awful for a few reasons. First of all, they must have accidentally switched the character assignments, because Michael Douglas played the roll that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should have been playing. While Douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping phone lines, hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him, Sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren\&#39;t going that badly for him. He plays a very bland agent, nothing like his Jack Bauer type roll us 24 fans love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It can be best compared to a remake of the &#34;The Fugitive&#34; / &#34;In The Line of Fire&#34; but written by people with mental disabilities&#39;,
   &#34;I just want to make one thing clear- I love Michael Vartan! But this film really lets him down. His acting is still superb, he&#39;s still as charming as ever, and he still looks great. But the film itself is a load of rubbish! Natasha Henstridge, I&#39;m sorry to say it, comes over bit manly... you&#39;re constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend, who&#39;s own sub-storyline is a little weird. Myself and my family (who sat down and watched the film with me) were also put off by the soundtrack to the film; at times the music just didn&#39;t fit with what was going on in the scenes. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I found to be a very disappointing film. I could forgive the leading lady&#39;s butch-ness, I could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix, and I could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment, but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end??? The ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold. If you&#39;re a Michael Vartan fan skip this film: buy yourself a poster instead.&#34;,
   &#39;Why else would he do this to me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I am aware of just how... &#34;good&#34; Dean Cain is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick, and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head. I will not call these spoilers as you can\&#39;t really spoil this movie any more than it already is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with... why is that a fake helicopter? I mean... why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How come that one scientist is from Chicago and that other scientist is from LA and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried? How hard would it have been to get either an american actor, or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren\&#39;t american?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line? We get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on. And then that\&#39;s it, who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared about it even when they mentioned it, but I guess that\&#39;s beside the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens? The answer is no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That dragon sure can walk down that hall..over..and over...and over....and over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history? It was straight out of scooby doo. Oh, the dragon\&#39;s dead now...say, wanna get dinner? Sure, but not at some Chinese place....with Dragon in the name!! AH HA HA HA!! HA HA HA!! HAHA HA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fade to black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my god, it made me cringe it was so stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But never fear..even though the whole building exploded...and no one was left alive..for some reason there\&#39;s a second untouched, unmanned lab that survived pretty well, so they can make a sequel. Hurray for us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;Utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one? This question has not occurred to the writers. The story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife-killing blackout driver. An omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure, and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale. Are police psychologists so easily taken in? Deadful writing that the actors do their best with, but they are doomed to failure. This is on a par with a Harlequin Romance. Don&#39;t waste your time watching this one unless that&#39;s what you are aiming for.&#34;,
   &#34;All you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late-60s period, and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable. Once you get that message, you may as well switch to another film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davies&#39;s protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world--instead of living a fantasy film of which he&#39;s the imagined director--he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he&#39;s idealized beyond reason. A couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is also interesting as documentation of Jason Schwartzman&#39;s fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman&#39;s annoying brattiness was something to be overcome, but here it&#39;s his character&#39;s only quality. Schwartzman&#39;s family connection clearly landed him in this role; here&#39;s hoping his choices improve.&#34;,
   &#39;This movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time. I generally like the cheap horror monster type movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures. When they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them. He doesn\&#39;t really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents, and unless i missed something the didn\&#39;t say how he managed to escape either... Not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience. It would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the &#34;cross incident&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;Yet ANOTHER movie about a group of less-than-intelligent individuals on a road trip who wander off their original travel route for either a short-cut or, in this case, to visit a run-down side show attraction. The results, as expected, are not at all good, as this particular side show is home to a bunch of lunatic, in-bred residents who were escaped prison inmates from years before. The father, who is apparently a professionally photographer, just HAS to stop and take pictures of the place, only to find that it still inhabited. The various members of the family wander off to view the various attractions, only to be scared away. Thinking they made it safely on their way, the van tire explodes (surprise!), leaving them to seek refuge and accommodations in the small town, which we find out is inhabited solely by the freaks (surprise!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film plays out as expected, with the family being stalked and killed by the freaks. There is some fighting back on the families part, but these are probably among the worst scenes in the film, as they are badly executed. There is nothing remotely original here, unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film. The acting is about as bad as I have seen in quite some time by everyone involved (it is pretty bad when your cast is out-acted by the cast of &#34;Camp Blood). The special effects are lousy and the ending made me want to punch my television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, though, despite all the negatives, I somewhat enjoyed this film. It definitely has a &#34;so bad it\&#39;s good&#34; vibe to it. I made it through the entire movie and was even pleasantly entertained once I got past the ridiculously clichéd plot, terrible acting, and cheesy special effects. Though the ending left me feeling cheated and angry, particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I can list countless films that if you have seen them, you have seen this. The difference is most of those film are better. Though not a complete waste, this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D&#39;,
   &#34;I felt Rancid Aluminium was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents. The camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey, it just made it even more difficult to watch. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience. The best performances weren&#39;t anything to do with acting. In fact probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary. DO NOT under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash.&#34;,
   &#34;I watched this show and i simply didn&#39;t find it funny at all. It might have been the first episode. Lately i realize ABC is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station. All the characters on this show are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down. I would say that I believe this show will be cancelled, but seeing as how ABC is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing, they might just keep this one simply because it&#39;s average compared to them.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Smithereens&#34; is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library. A worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director Seidelman, the film is fraught with bad acting, bad sound, bad camera work, and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of life\&#39;s great mysteries. (D-)&#39;,
   &#34;Despite its stereotypes, virtually &#39;no-name&#39; cast and an obviously low budget I thought this film was alright; much better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. But in the end, I thought the film handled the concept well (even if some scenes were a little clichéd).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. I couldn&#39;t help thinking, though, that Janine Turner is a bit of a Geena Davis look-a-like. Maybe it&#39;s just her face or the make-up, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#39;s not a &#39;must see&#39; or a great film by any standard, &#39;Fatal Error&#39; is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end.&#34;,
   &#34;Lorenzo Lamas stars as some type of CIA agent, who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble. I must admit i&#39;m not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or his movies. He stinks. However when compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas&#39; comatose wife Kinmont, Lamas seems like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw CIA because of the renewed interest around the O.J Simpson trial, you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels, you couldn&#39;t escape this movie. in 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable TV. The movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor. Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* out of 4-(Bad)&#34;,
   &#34;you can tell they spent 5$ making this.it is a waste of your time... ugh.. there is not anything remotely good about this movie... .. i don&#39;t know why i kept watching it.. the chick is not hot. horrid acting.. you could do anything and its a better use of your time.. like watching TV playing shitty video games.. i feel robbed. simply robbed.. of my time . i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on IMDb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments. -there was no action- -no hot chicks- -no budget- -shittttttttttttttty acting- it screams bad movie. ****the WHOLE movie is in a room.***&#34;,
   &#39;This movie made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg &amp; Danny Glover, in addition to that have always trusted &amp; respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles, &#34;Grand Canyon&#34; for example. I just could not finish this movie, after what seemed an eternity, but was probably just a little over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them, there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama &amp; not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better, because I love to watch white people freak out &amp; start acting like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) became a waste of my $1 credit at the video store.&#39;,
   &#39;Now what\&#39;s wrong with the actors that took part in that crap? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? Liked him there... Well, whatever - what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead? Nothing, and that\&#39;s what we get. None of the characters is even likable, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic whatsoever for what\&#39;s happening. I got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of &#34;Attack of the killer tomatoes&#34; kind of thing. Especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to see it on TV, switch channels - your TV set will be ever thankful.&#39;,
   &#34;Where do I start? Per the title of this film I expected some degree of authenticity, in the end I was severally let down. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, rather it is a Hollywood (or pick your film making hub) story loosely based on some real life characters. I should have had a clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving the intro to the movie in German; the blood red text (title, artists) should have been the 2nd clue. The story line is contrived (Lale was not tricked out of Switzerland Rolf Liebermann&#39;s parents, there is no info that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the NS regime not while under control, the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna while a Lt. was there on leave, etc, etc) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames (SS black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions, these went away from daily use once the war started, etc), the characters are stereo types (SA bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power). Don&#39;t waste your time.&#34;,
   &#39;Shlock-merchant Leo Fulci takes a change of pace by making a trashy, barely coherent sword and sorcery fantasy movie instead of his usual trashy, barely coherent horror. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wimpy Orlando Bloom type called Ilias, from some society vaguely resembling Ancient Greece travels across the ocean to caveman territory on some vaguely defined quest to battle evil, where he joins up with a animal loving hunter to battle the wolf-man and mutant minions of a vampiric topless evil sorceress. Wackiness ensues. The sorceress, is oppressing the local cavemen and wants the magic bow for herself. She sends various minions, each weirder than the last, after our heroes who win through in the end, striking a blow for oppressed cavemen everywhere. This movie contains a steady stream of WTF? elements and moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason the entire movie is shot in soft focus and the picture is further blurred by the constant presence of mist on screen. This may have been an attempt to create atmosphere or to hide how fake everything looks. Either way, it failed. There is no atmosphere, unless it is one of scuzziness and mild bewilderment and there is no hiding how lame everything looks. The wolf-man minions look like a poor man\&#39;s wookie. For some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion, Six Million Dollar Man style, toward our heroes when they attack. There are probably about a dozen of these shots throughout the movie and it gets goofier every time. The other minions of the topless sorceress, other than the generic leather clad humans, are some lumpy white mutants who appear to be covered in cobwebs. Needless to say they are slow and unthreatening and when they speak sound like gay Hispanic, lisping Daleks. The fights are stilted and unconvincing and the special effects are woeful. Oh yeah, the music is cheap synthesiser stuff that the makers of Doctor Who would have been embarrassed to have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ilias, our nominal hero is bland and forgettable. He also looks a complete wuss, especially with his midriff revealing leather outfit and big hair, and is clearly a moron. Sure, he\&#39;s a dynamite shot with his magical bow but he only takes about three or four arrows with him in his mission to battle this entire continent of evil. Needless to say he runs out of arrows within a few minutes and has to be saved by more traditional sword and sorcery hero, Mace. When he meets Ilias he establishes himself as the taciturn loner type, claiming he has no friends but no sooner can you say latent homoerotic subtext they are bosom buddies, traipsing the misty hills together. Mace promises to take Ilias with him in return for bow related favours. Ilias asks where he is going. &#34;Wherever my legs take me,&#34; is his reply. Good enough for Ilias. Mace is also animal lover and outrageous hypocrite. He proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animals, citing the usual stuff about how he prefers them to humans because humans can be soooo mean. He says he would never hunt and kill an animal to feed himself but he will steal meat off other people who have hunted down animals. He is also not above randomly killing innocent passers by for no good reason. Not long after they meet, he is testing out Ilias\&#39; bow and the movie cuts to some random caveman, minding his own business, walking along and Mace shoots him dead. There is no indication this poor soul did anything to deserve this and even Ilias, who supposedly hails from a more moral and civilised society doesn\&#39;t even raise an eyebrow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The films villainess is quite unusual. For the entire movie she is completely naked except from a g-string and a golden mask that encompasses her entire head. It\&#39;s like Fulci included her to make the movies obligatory T&amp;A quotient but decided she was bit too much of a butterface at the last minute. She spends a lot of time seemingly being pleasured by her pet snakes and dreaming about being shot by a faceless bow wielding man who is dressed like Ilias. Wow, such symbolism! Later on in the movie she wimps out when she can\&#39;t beat Ilias and Mace and promises to make herself the sex-slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her. Hardly the world\&#39;s most scary villain and not really a step forward for women\&#39;s rights. I think he sic\&#39;s the cobweb creatures on our heroes and impersonates Mace in a situation where there is no no-one else around but Mace to fool. Was he really worthy trading your self respect for, Ocron? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are quite a few other WTF? moments. Most of them come toward the end of the movie. Ilias wusses out, I forget why, possibly his permed hairdo got mussed, but realizes the error of his ways and returns to aid Mace in fighting the forces of evil. All of a sudden, for no reason, his bow can suddenly fire out multiple target seeking bolts of energy. The bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary. Needless to say his makes short work of the hordes of bad guys who have captured Mace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The climax is also rather nonsensical. Mace decimates Ocron\&#39;s remaining forces using the bows targeted laser attack capability. He then is able to shoot Ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity. She starts dying. Her mask is ripped of revealing a hideous Muppet head. She staggers around screaming and turns into a dog and wanders off with another dog. Mace smiles. Roll credits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely enough as far as these dodgy low budget sword and sorcery movies this one is reasonably lucid and focused. Any one who has seen Wizards of the Lost Kingdom can tell you how nonsensical and meandering these movies can truly be.&#39;,
   &#39;I am a big fan of the Spaghetti Western Genre, and I usually also like most of the cheaply made ones. Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheapest, trashiest, and, well, worst contributions to the genre. The plots of Fidani\&#39;s movies were usually very weak, and since his talent was quite limited, he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like &#34;Django&#34; of &#34;Sartana&#34; to the titles. I the particular case of &#34;Giù La Testa... Hombre&#34; of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leone\&#39;s &#34;Giù La Testa&#34; (aka. &#34;Duck You Sucker&#34;) and added \&#39;Hombre\&#39;. The movie can be found under various titles (&#34;Fistful Of Death&#34;, &#34;Western Story&#34;...), I personally bought it under the name &#34;Adios Companeros&#34;, which this movie shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast, &#34;Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari&#34;, which is also entitled &#34;Adios Companeros&#34; in the German language version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is rather weak, it basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leading performance by Jeff Cameron is, kindly stated, not very convincing. Neither did I find Jack Betts very good as \&#39;Butch Cassidy\&#39;. B-movie legend Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth a try, and although he probably wasn\&#39;t a very good actor, I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original, and he actually saved some of Fidani\&#39;s movies (such as the rather crappy &#34;Django And Sartana... Showdown in the West&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one very funny and original thing about &#34;Giù La Testa... Hombre&#34; - the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest! I could have imagined Kinski in any role, but before seeing this movie I would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest. Kinski is, once again, great, although he has only little screen time, and one scene, where he breaks up a fight, is probably the only good scene in this. One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze Joe D\&#39;Amato did the cinematography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Giù La Testa... Hombre&#34; is a cheap, crappy film, but nevertheless, it has some funny moments. Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast, I found it fun to watch, but if you\&#39;re not, never mind this movie, or watch it only for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest. 3/10&#39;,
   &#39;Well, what can you say about sitcoms. There often quite lame, morale dedicative, and just plain. So is this show! It got a boring cast, although A.Bynes is okej in her perky way, the rest is just stereotypical crap....as always. We have all seen it before, and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled. Cause, lets face it, its a mediocre and self righteous show. As the most sitcoms are....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, in short. If you wanna see some good entertainment, you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror. Do some faces and move on.... Its more entertaining than this show!&#39;,
   &#34;this movie was definitely the worst movie i&#39;ve seen in my entire life, and i&#39;ve seen some pretty bad movies. i didn&#39;t like the way this movie was filmed. all of the actors are unknown, and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie. but it&#39;s absolutely horrible. i&#39;ve never seen a worse movie. the story is so fake, and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it looked as though it wasn&#39;t planned out before they started filming. the story is too weird. i didn&#39;t like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. there was no point in even filming this movie. if you&#39;re considering watching this movie, don&#39;t. you&#39;re just wasting your time.&#34;,
   &#34;I cannot vote on this because I wouldn&#39;t watch garbage from these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it&#39;s my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash. Go to the forums on this film and read where cast members try to act like they are seeing the movie for the first time. One guy even responds to himself ...using the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it&#39;s as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane...Not even close (by no means). If this is the company&#39;s 2nd movie, it should be better than the first. That means the 3rd movie should be a lot better. Not so, I&#39;ve seen it. All I want to know is how you distribute this trash using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine...but don&#39;t try to market that trash!&#34;,
   &#39;This film is definitely a product of its times and seen in any other context, it is an incredibly stupid movie. Heck, even seen in its proper context, it\&#39;s pretty bad!! Mostly, this is due to a silly plot and very self-indulgent direction by the famed Italian director, Michelangelo Antonioni. In this case, he tried to meld a very artsy style film with an anti-establishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of gargantuan proportions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins with a rap session where a lot of &#34;with it&#34; students sit around saying such platitudes as &#34;power to the people&#34; and complaining about &#34;the man&#34;. Considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college, it seemed a bit silly for these privileged kids to be complaining so loudly and shouting revolutionary jargon. A bit later, violence between the students and the &#34;establishment pigs&#34; breaks out and a cop is killed. Our &#34;hero&#34;, Mark, may or may not have done it, but he is forced to run to avoid prosecution. Instead of heading to Mexico or Canada, he does what only a total moron would do--steals an airplane and flies it to the Mojave Desert! There, he meets a happen\&#39; chick and they then sit around philosophizing for hours. Then, they have sex in one of the weirder sex scenes in cinema history. As they gyrate about in the dust, suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene. While you see a bit of skin (warranting an R-rating), it\&#39;s not as explicit as it could have been. In fact, it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind. And of course, when they are finished, the many, many other couples vanish into thin air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a Peter Max creation. Despite improving the look of the plane, the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary. When the girl finds out, she goes into a semi-catatonic state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for (such as hard work and responsibility). Instead of one simple explosion, you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times. Then, inexplicably, you see TVs, refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion. While dumb, it is rather cool to watch--sort of like when David Letterman blows things up or smashes things on his show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from a dopey plot, the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing. At least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bit--especially since there really isn\&#39;t all that much plot or dialog. The bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and I was not surprised to see it listed in &#34;The Fifty Worst Films&#34; book by Harry Medved. It\&#39;s a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap. For such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a craptastic film is a crime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two final observations. If you like laughing at silly hippie movies, also try watching THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK. Also, in a case of art imitating life, the lead, Mark Frechette, acted out his character in real life. He died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of &#34;revolution&#34; in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person. Dang hippies!!&#39;,
   &#39;I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that this was made in \&#39;84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the &#34;reformed&#34; Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. And Tiny Tim... oh don\&#39;t even get me started on bad child actors...&#39;,
   &#34;This was a strange kind of film about a low-lifes in New York City and centering around a main character (the title name, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he&#39;&#39;s a Ricky Nelson-type musician, except he has no real talent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s kind of fun to watch until a profane tough New York City-type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over. That ruined the film for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays tough and garbage-mouthed women. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairdo on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to look at. I can picture Johnny Depp playing this role better. One last note: it odd to hear a film made in 1992 (other than Woody Allen&#39;s) with just mono sound.&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;m not a fan of the Left Behind book series - the books are written at a 6th-grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science, technology, and politics. While the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture, their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous (an example is their explanation for the Russian/Arab invasion of Israel). Also, the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel. Still, I found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of Revelation. For a similar reason, I watched this film adaptation. I am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor. The acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over-acting. The script is rather bad, though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. Events feel scattered and disconnected. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. Here, the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book. The pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed, and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded. The music is schizophrenic. At times, it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture. At other moments, it reminds me of sitcom and mini-series music. And still other bits remind me of a poppy MTV soundtrack that just doesn&#39;t belong in the film. I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane, but that&#39;s it. The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling. The film also suffers from the book&#39;s preachiness although its message isn&#39;t quite as in your face. In all, I found the movie just as disappointing as the series. This is not the film to rally Christians around it. I hope that this film does NOT get any attention at the theaters next year. It would be more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity. For an example of a compelling, intelligent, well-researched series based on Revelation that presents a realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader (who after all should be whom a Christian is trying to reach) read the Christ Clone trilogy by James BeauSeigneur. It&#39;s a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality.&#34;,
   &#39;This one hearkens back to the days of the matinée, when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below. It didn\&#39;t matter what was on the screen - the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it. The adults, of course, would never see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they put it on video, anyway, along with most of the other creaky, low-budget &#34;B&#34; horror flicks of the golden age...of television. This film\&#39;s inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology (the &#34;bad girls&#34; harvested to replace poor Jan\&#39;s crushed body - they had it comin\&#39;), overused plot (a mad scientist, trying to play God), violent yet conscientious monster (whose presence in the heretofore-normal-seeming scientist\&#39;s rural lab is never fully explained), and acting that polarizes at wooden or over-the-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great party film, assuming your guests enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic exploits. In fact, should you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment, this film is also available on video in its &#34;Mystery Science Theater 3000&#34; treatment, in which the host and puppets of the cult TV series make the necessary additions for you.&#39;,
   &#34;They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station. They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived. You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot, four young boys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice over narration. Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion. Once they&#39;re grown, it&#39;s easy to spot the writer/director among the four. He&#39;s the quiet, contemplative, long-haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants. This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. Only there&#39;s no writing, or directing talent on display here. And if you still can&#39;t figure out which one he is, here&#39;s a hint: The auteur and his character have the same middle name. It took over an hour to figure out that these twenty-something men were supposed to still be in high school. What looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the warden turned out to be the principal. Once more, the poor, misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement, murder and pillage, but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father. How about hitting back, kid, like you do everyone else? Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose. Howlingly bad dialogue. Many scenes badly out of focus. Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras, drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience. Overacting in the extreme. And if you don&#39;t quite get the self-important speeches, or the slow-motion scenes, just listen to the overbearing music. It will clue you in and what you&#39;re supposed to feel. Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films. The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies, run over puppies chained to a tree, rob and steal, all the while complaining about their sad, sorry lives. But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college. Yeah, that&#39;s the ticket. Why is it that every twenty-something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important, so interesting, that the world can&#39;t wait to see it onscreen? If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems, then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants.&#34;,
   &#34;Young and attractive Japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again, this time it involves mobile phones. Various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed, so essentially if you&#39;ve seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I&#39;ve been more impressed with his low key works like City of Lost Souls, however as One Missed Call plodded along I was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of Dead or Alive or the overly pseudo-Cronenberg style of Audition. Despite a lot of his films being essentially empty, at least they do have merits such as these, or at least something to keep your attention like Tadanobu Asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating Johnny Depp. There&#39;s none of that in One Missed Call; there&#39;s just very little of credit: the acting is bland and average, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in the way of scares or suspense, and in places it&#39;s just downright boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are moments where Miike&#39;s glacier-like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism; most notably with the instance of the TV show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects, and the TV programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls&#39; life. But aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is Miike behind the camera; most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace (and that includes his famous gore), although it&#39;s more likely he just didn&#39;t have any enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. One Missed Call isn&#39;t offensively bad. It&#39;s just frustratingly average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miike obviously loves directing. With his huge yearly output it&#39;s obvious he isn&#39;t going to be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even with this in mind, One Missed Call felt like he was just paying the bills.&#34;,
   &#39;LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie . I have seen the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u.......................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie really waste yours time and money . I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema-hall......................................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Role of CIRCUIT was very small n useless n this movie . I think SANJAY-DUTT cut down the role of ARSHAD VARSHI........................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one .this movie show u the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE .........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideas of MAHATMA is also not define and confusing..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A REALLY VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT&#39;,
   &#34;The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. It should have read &#39;Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family&#39;s church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about God&#39;s will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny&#39;s &#39;how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?&#39; moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. I believe I counted the use of the word &#39;pray&#39; about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, &#39;prey&#39;. Sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say &#39;prayer&#39; (&#39;preyer&#39; to me) as it became totally zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as Jesus Camp, The God Who Wasn&#39;t There, What Would Jesus Buy, or the soon-to-be released Religulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Robert Whitlow&#39;s book is better.&#34;,
   &#39;No matter what anyone tells you, there is a mere fact to the word &#34;possession&#34; in film circles -- such as &#34;what possessed you to greenlight this film?&#34; Religion doesn\&#39;t have anything to do with it, but common sense does. That is, if your head is clear and you are of sound mind to make a judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On many levels I tried to rationalize where this film would entertain....or even interest the average consumer. The star? The story? The unique idea? A buddy movie that kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman? On, my goodness! I am sure when this was an &#34;idea&#34;, it sounded good. But somewhere during the course of development...someone should have pointed out where the idea could not translate into a piece of entertainment anyone would wish to watch or pay for...unless they were very much deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something the rest of us could not see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this is a complete mess. Mess, mess - sin and a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who cares about the plot (what plot?) et al. Whoopie got a paycheck, but I would have been embarrassed to take it. I sure hope she fired her agent/manager/publicist over this career move. Obviously not, she went on to make more bad films. And more bad films. Sad.&#39;,
   &#39;I initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of Silent Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a huge Silent Hill fan, and disappointed with it\&#39;s movie debut, I thought I would give this one a chance. Mind, Fearnet only lists this movie as &#34;Dark Floors&#34;, not by it\&#39;s full name. So when I saw the name &#34;Mr. Lordi&#34; in the credits I immediately thought of the band (I had a few friends in college that like them) but didn\&#39;t think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts out strong. Despite the fact &#34;creepy little girl&#34; has been done to DEATH, the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together. The tense atmosphere built rapidly, and every indication pointed to the film being excellent. As monsters are the true stars of horror, I couldn\&#39;t wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the first monster showed up, and I found myself greatly underwhelmed. By the time the second appeared, I boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a Megadeth concert, and the silliness turned me off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact, and the story left you wondering just what was going on, but the scares were pretty much non-existent. However, I held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile. Unfortunately that was not to be the case. By the time the movie had reached it\&#39;s climax, I was in utter disbelief, and I immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal... The lead singer of Lordi? Seriously? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was that what the movie all boiled down to? A bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by Lordi band members? The silly monster design suddenly made sense. If you\&#39;re going to be that corny, may as well through the members of Marilyn Manson, or even KISS in there too. Not to mention the fact that I\&#39;m pretty sure I saw the ending in one of Lordi\&#39;s music videos a few years ago. They had to go and make an entire movie off of it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, when I found out what really had been going on, all I could manage was a yawn. I\&#39;m not going to &#34;ruin&#34; it for you, but I can safely say it\&#39;s probably a plot device you\&#39;ve seen before. Most likely more then once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unless you\&#39;re a huge Lordi fan, stay away from this. It\&#39;s not scary, it doesn\&#39;t bring anything new to the table (although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies, mainly Silent Hill). And, I can\&#39;t stress this enough, LORDI is the antagonist. LORDI. Talk about a buzzkill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, you\&#39;d be better off trying to scare yourself watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it\&#39;s just not possible.&#39;,
   &#39;In the questionable comedy vein of Mel Brooks, &#34;Wholly Moses!&#34; tries to take the Bible story of Moses and make fun of it, resulting in the unfunniest Biblical spoof ever filmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no real plot here, just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles. Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman are on a bus tour of the Holy Land, when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave. There they read the story of Herschel and Zerelda, also played by Moore and Newman. Herschel\&#39;s life parallels Moses\&#39;. He was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh\&#39;s family at the same time Moses was. Herschel\&#39;s birth father, the late James Coco, becomes Herschel\&#39;s slave after Herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor. Eventually Herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer, is banished, and ends up tending Moses\&#39; flock of sheep. Herschel and Moses are brothers in law, marrying sisters, and Herschel thinks God has chosen him to free his people in Egypt. Of course, Moses was receiving the Divine Word, but Herschel misunderstood. I\&#39;ll pause here to laugh hysterically...pause...anyway, the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving Moore and actors who are making &#34;special appearances.&#34; These scenes do not propel the plot forward, they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack Gilford plays a tailor. Dom DeLuise has maybe three lines when he meets Herschel in the desert. John Houseman is an archangel, just giving the same line readings he gave in &#34;The Paper Chase.&#34; David L. Lander is a fake blind man &#34;healed&#34; by Herschel. Andrea Martin is one of Zerelda\&#39;s sisters. I was not sure who Madeline Kahn was supposed to be, she gives a ride to Herschel, and has about a minute and a half of screen time. John Ritter plays a very unfunny devil. Richard Pryor has one scene as the pharaoh, but it was obviously shot at a different time than Moore\&#39;s scene because the two do not appear onscreen together! In the end, Zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on New Sodom\&#39;s destruction, ha ha. Herschel writes the Ten Commandments, and gives them to Moses, who is basking in all the glory. In the final scenes, the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having Herschel bait God into an argument. God comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading Herschel around for his own amusement, speaking through him only to give him the Ten Commandments. We even have Zerelda quip &#34;God works in mysterious ways,&#34; thereby excusing everyone\&#39;s very unChristian behavior during the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is not funny. There is nary a laugh to be found anywhere. At least Monty Python made fun of many established religious mainstays in &#34;Life of Brian&#34; in addition to their questionable take on Jesus\&#39; life, but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads. This makes Mel Brooks look like Merchant/Ivory. Churchgoers will be offended, not by the film\&#39;s attitude toward religion, but by the smugness the movie exhibits, impressed with their own hoitytoityness (I know, not a word) on a subject they obviously know nothing about. &#34;Wholly Moses!&#34; is wholly bad, and an embarassment to all involved. I suggest you read the Book instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is rated (PG) for some physical violence, profanity, sexual references, and adult situations.&#39;,
   &#39;Put aside a Dr. House repeat that I had missed, and a Desperate Housewives (new) to watch this one. I don\&#39;t know exactly what plagued this movie. I never thought I\&#39;d say this, but I want my 15 minutes of fame back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Script, Direction, I can\&#39;t say. I recognized the stable of actors (the usual suspects), but thought Herbert Marshall was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick. Boy, was I wrong. Dullsville.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite parts: where the &#34;office girl&#34; makes with the 029 keypunch and puts the cards into a 087 sorter. LOL @ &#34;the computer&#34;. I\&#39;d like someone identify the next device - a 477 ? It\&#39;s before even this dinosaur\&#39;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we dinosaurs don\&#39;t have that much time to waste.&#39;,
   &#39;We know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie. A waste of time. The premise was not too bad. But one workable idea (interaction between real bussinessmen and Russian mafia) is not followed by an intelligent script&#39;,
   &#34;I like Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this film. The idea of remaking Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy remade Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he re-did them totally -- so they became Murphy films/vehicles, not just tepid remakes. That&#39;s why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film. It also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly. So why does Hollywood keep making junk like this? Because people go to see it -- because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Don&#39;t remake films that weren&#39;t that good in the first place!&#34;,
   &#39;This version of &#34;Moby Dick&#34; insults the audience by claiming it is based on Melville\&#39;s novel-even going so far as to show a phony first chapter sentence rather than the famous &#34;Call me Ishmael&#34;. In addition to having atrocious acting, even from John Barrymore,this is perhaps the greatest example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) would go to revise and change a famous novel just to beef up its chances at the box office.All of the novel\&#39;s beautiful,poetic language has been absolutely eradicated, and Ahab has been changed from a brooding,blasphemous,obsessive madman to a dashing,misunderstood hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance(!) turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg. To this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself, and a different ending!&#39;,
   &#39;When robot hordes start attacking major cities, who will stop the madman behind the attacks? Sky Captain!!! Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan, the ace of the skyways, tackling insurmountable odds along with his pesky reporter ex-girlfriend Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) and former flight partner, Captain Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and underwhelming. The film\&#39;s running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie. The visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that. However, there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals. The film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary. I blame director and writer Kerry Conran. He focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story. The movie is like a girl with no personality, after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring. Sky Captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality. It\&#39;s simply just another case of style over substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is surprisingly average and that\&#39;s not really their fault since they had very little to work with. The main reason I watched this movie is because of Angelina Jolie. However, the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes. Her performance is surprisingly bland as well. Jude Law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him. Gwyneth Paltrow was just average, nothing special at all. Ling Bai\&#39;s performance was the only one I really liked. She gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is not a complete bust though. There were some &#34;wow&#34; and exciting scenes. There just weren\&#39;t enough of them. The film just doesn\&#39;t have that hook to really make it memorable. It was actually quite bland and it wasn\&#39;t very engaging at all. It\&#39;s too bad the film wasn\&#39;t very good since it had such a promising premise. In the end, Sky Captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching. Rating 4/10&#39;,
   &#34;A killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem, are back on the case. Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. Now I&#39;m all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. If it wasn&#39;t for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of gore but it&#39;s never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film. It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is extremely bad. You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#34;,
   &#39;This extremely weak Australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the Pavlov Dog Experiment amongst horror movies. You remember this famous &#34;Conditioned Reflex&#34; experiment from your school books, right? The Russian scientist Pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal\&#39;s reflexes. Pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and, after a while, he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell. What the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low-budgeted Aussie slasher flick, I hear you think? Well, the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in &#34;Nightmares&#34; is an exact variant on Pavlov\&#39;s experiment. Each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window, because he/she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims. So this means that, after a short while, inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass. That way they still don\&#39;t miss anything special! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the quality of &#34;Nightmares&#34; as a film I can be very brief. This is a cheap, uninspired and largely imbecilic Aussie cash-in on the contemporary popular trend of American slasher movies. In the early 60\&#39;s, a four-year-old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident. Twenty years later the same girl \x96 Helen Selleck \x96 is a successful stage actress, but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares. She auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part. Shortly after the big premiere, everyone who\&#39;s even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered. It is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer\&#39;s identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already. I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve ever seen a more obvious whodunit than &#34;Nightmares&#34; and the creators should have just showed his/her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment. The murders are explicit and very bloody and there\&#39;s also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to &#34;enjoy&#34;. However, the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative. The few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage. The only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic, whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do. &#34;Nightmares&#34; is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema, but hey, at least I gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible.&#39;,
   &#34;There&#39;s nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It&#39;s just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The acting is awful, the script dire; and the special effects overrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does Hollywood treat it&#39;s audience with such contempt? And why have they made a sequel?&#34;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must of seen some pretty hard stuff to see in it to be able to award it with the best picture Oscar. All I know is that fortunately there was Gene Kelly to play in it or this would have been twice as bad as I believe it is. First of all, I don\&#39;t think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She isn\&#39;t that talented, she isn\&#39;t a great dancer and she\&#39;s not good looking at all. It\&#39;s a shame that one actor or actress may ruin a movie just like by playing in it because if Leslie Caron hadn\&#39;t been in this, it might have made a terrific movie. The story was intelligent, the directing wasn\&#39;t bad, and, as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I\&#39;m not saying all this stuff about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I\&#39;m just saying it because I think that\&#39;s what the worse part of the movie is. She\&#39;s probably a good actress but I can\&#39;t tell because I haven\&#39;t seen her in anything else but I think she was pretty bad in &#34;An American in Paris&#34;. So if you want to see it, go ahead but I\&#39;m telling you, you\&#39;re way better off watching &#34;Singin\&#39; in the rain&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;AKA: Mondays In The Sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what I just watched. Three men wander aimlessly and drink, grousing about everything and at everyone in their path. This is supposed to be a drama, but what it is, is a total waste of film, without a single redeeming quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews touting the performances herein as &#34;wonderful,&#34; &#34;beautiful,&#34; and &#34;heroic.&#34; I\&#39;m afraid I cannot agree, unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto-humans who ever walked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all? This was not a movie. It wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience. I\&#39;ve watched this three times, and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage. There is nothing profound here, whatsoever. It\&#39;s crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rates a ZERO/10 from...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Fiend :.&#39;,
   &#39;The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best Horror films of all time. This is the crappiest. When I sat down to watch this, I was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were, this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones. Boy was I wrong. Incredibly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I watched the first ten minutes of it, I was actually really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it\&#39;ll improve. It didn\&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this just a dire film by itself, it didn\&#39;t need another sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) had already been terrible enough! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back!? The acting in it was TERRIBLE, the story-line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well. The way they made Springwood was just totally wrong. Pays no respect to the first one at-all. To add to this, the whole thing seemed really over-the-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are saying that this film was &#34;funny&#34;. This film is not &#34;funny&#34; at all. Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be &#34;funny&#34;? I would call it funnily crap. This film is supposed to be a Horror film, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, wouldn\&#39;t that information have surfaced like in the first one!? The ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy, exactly like the rest of it. This one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. Just shows itself up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a shame that Wes Craven created something so good in the beginning, yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin. They shouldn\&#39;t have even bothered making this film. Nor any of the other sequels, except the third one. The third one\&#39;s the only decent one out of all the sequels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this was a DVD by itself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set that I got, I would have chucked it out when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: A pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- a complete MOCKERY of the first film &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please, don\&#39;t waste your time on this worthless junk.&#39;,
   &#34;Vijay Krishna Acharya&#39;s &#39;Tashan&#39; is a over-hyped, stylized, product. Sure its a one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby. Script is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all-time cannot do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner &#39;Yash Raj Films&#39; and Mega Stars appearing in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland. Thumbs down! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he okay a role like this? Akshay Kumar is great actor, in fact he&#39;s the sole saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up. Saif Ali Khan doesn&#39;t get his due in here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Tashan&#39; is a boring film. The films failure at the box office, should you keep away.&#34;,
   &#34;To be a Buster Keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis. Most of us first encounter Keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production: &#39;The General&#39;, &#39;The Navigator&#39;, &#39;Sherlock Jnr&#39;. We recognise him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy, and we want to see more of his movies. Here the heartbreak begins. After &#39;Steamboat Bill Jnr&#39;, Keaton&#39;s brother-in-law Joseph Schenck pressured him into signing a contract that put Keaton under the control of MGM. Keaton became just one more actor for hire, performing someone else&#39;s scripts. Then his alcoholism got worse. After &#39;Steamboat Bill Jnr&#39;, Keaton never again made a truly first-rate film. A couple of sources describe a would-be masterpiece comedy that Keaton claimed he *almost* got to make at MGM: a parody of &#39;Grand Hotel&#39;. Biographer Tom Dardis has offered convincing evidence that Keaton made up this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heartbreak increases because, among the many years of Keaton&#39;s long steady decline, he just occasionally came up with a good film ... such as his short comedy &#39;Grand Slam Opera&#39;. I continue to search for the lost footage of Keaton&#39;s dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy in &#39;It&#39;s a Mad Mad World&#39;: a sequence in which embittered cop Tracy telephones an old retired crook (Keaton) and tries to recruit his assistance in stealing Smiler Grogan&#39;s cash. That footage is almost certainly gone forever, but I keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Speak Easily&#39;, alas, is one of Keaton&#39;s films from the beginning of his decline. MGM were trying to build up Jimmy Durante (who, coincidentally, played Smiler Grogan three decades later) as a new comedy star. Unfortunately, MGM tried to build up Durante by teaming him with Keaton, whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with Durante&#39;s. (I&#39;m a fan of both.) Throughout his career, Durante was a merciless scene-stealer: commendably, he knew that he was being built up at Keaton&#39;s expense, and Keaton was the only co-star whom Durante never attempted to upstage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel machinations. In &#39;Speak Easily&#39;, he plays a didactic and humourless Midwestern college professor named Post (because he&#39;s as wooden as one) who receives a letter informing him that he&#39;s inherited $750,000, which he must travel to New York City to claim. Does he make a &#39;phone call to verify this? Does he even check the postmark? No; he takes his life&#39;s savings out of the bank and rushes to New York. As soon as he&#39;s gone, Post&#39;s manservant confesses that he wrote the (fake) letter to jostle Professor Post out of his rut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post, who thinks he&#39;s a 3/4-millionaire, crosses paths with Jimmy Dodge (Durante), who&#39;s trying to produce a musical revue but hasn&#39;t any money. The characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing onscreen simply fail to intermesh. Keaton is playing one of those eggheads (like Mister Logic in &#39;Viz&#39;) who intellectualises everything. Durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in slang. There&#39;s a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which Durante is trying to talk to Keaton about money, but - instead of coming straight out with it - Durante has to use increasingly contrived slang terms like &#39;kale&#39;, &#39;cartwheels&#39; and so forth ... while Keaton of course has no idea what Durante&#39;s on about. I&#39;ll give Keaton credit: his own dry and dusty prairie voice, his flat Kansas accent, is absolutely perfect for the character he&#39;s playing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidney Toler, looking much leaner and more handsome here than he would be just a year later, is impressive as the excitable director of the revue bankrolled (on tick) by Professor Post. Henry Armetta, whom I&#39;ve never found funny, is even less funny than usual here, offering a running gag with a stupid payoff. Thelma Todd impressed me here, in a more villainous version of the role she played in &#39;Horse Feathers&#39; (a much funnier movie). Edward Brophy, one of my favourite character actors, is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the problem with &#39;Speak Easily&#39; is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways. Keaton&#39;s lawyer shows up at Durante&#39;s theatre with an urgent message for Keaton ... but he isn&#39;t there, so the lawyer proceeds to divulge Keaton&#39;s personal business to the first total stranger he meets. (Fire that lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - the guy who&#39;s perceived as bankrolling this musical - blunders into the chorus girls&#39; changing room, and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and cover themselves. I know for a fact that *modern* chorus girls would never react this way, and I seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 behaved that way either ... certainly not in response to the &#39;angel&#39; controlling their show&#39;s pursestrings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILERS COMING. About half an hour into the unfunny &#39;Speak Easily&#39;, the great Jimmy Durante seats himself at the piano, grins into the camera, and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune. This is the moment when I thought that, at long last, this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us. Alas, no. Most annoying of all is the ending of this film, which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy: the one in which an utterly incompetent dimwit becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude. (Keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a 1955 episode of &#39;Screen Directors Playhouse&#39;; Chaplin had already used it in &#39;The Circus&#39;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very nearly wept - in anger and sorrow - at the wasted opportunities in &#39;Speak Easily&#39;. Mostly out of respect for the work that Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd have done elsewhere, I&#39;ll rate this movie 2 points out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#34;**** SPOILER WARNING ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. Totally impossible to take any of this seriously. It would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it. During the glory days of her program, Carol Burnett and company, who often did take-offs on films, skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked Ryan O&#39;Neal. The only thing funnier than this bit, is the real film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a death scene at the end. Jenny really looks like she&#39;s dying alright...dying for her make-up artist to come in and give her a little color. And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patient&#39;s final moments. The ending scene with Ryan O&#39;Neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie business is an instant classic. He had plenty to worry about. He never did recover from this.&#34;,
   &#39;This move is slow, plodding, cold, dark, and without a plot or hope. It follows that tried and true European formula that they love to subsidize, that is never seen, but that the critics think makes an &#34;important point&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between Americans and Europeans regarding employment. In this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it\&#39;s the government\&#39;s duty to provide them with work. Whereas in the U.S. we know we have to go out there and create value for someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spain never looked so backward!&#39;,
   &#34;If you seen Rodney Dangerfield&#39;s previous movies and performances, you&#39;ll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck. Written like a sitcom, this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver Molly Shannon to the &#39;I&#39;m fat, and therefore funny&#39; John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off like a male fantasy that&#39;s trying hard not to be politically incorrect.&#34;,
   &#34;The acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be a failing within myself, but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It&#39;s a shame, because it could have been wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn&#39;t. Probably worth watching, just to make your own mind up on it - but don&#39;t expect too much, and perhaps you won&#39;t be as disappointed as I was. Mostly, it bored me.&#34;,
   &#34;I shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing, preachy cinematic trash. Larded with enough Indian-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new-age shop, Starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather-wearing crystal-fondling idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert Earth&#39;s impending environmental collapse. But first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a Castro street bar. Fortunately, they&#39;ve got mystical grandpa Willie Nelson along to help (who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings, as well he ought to be) along with buckets of cheap F/X and reams of pointlessly swelling music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the clunky script helps to obscure the film&#39;s trite plot and staggering pace, but that&#39;s just the tip of this melting movie iceberg. Everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science.&#34;,
   &#34;For every series that makes it to television, a 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made, and one, just one, actually makes it to production. From such a selection process, we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it goes with True Blood; all the stars were in alignment and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea, a screen play, a pilot, and finally a series. Unfortunately, it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings. Oh how wrong they so often are...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest story lines, worst acting, and silliest subplots as anything in recent television history. Its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep tripping over their fake southern accents. Alan Ball&#39;s not so secret desires for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline. Tara&#39;s angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the vamps take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white suppression while attend a ceremony for the Glorious Dead of the Confedercy. Sam finds suppressed love for Sookie and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning, noon, and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Bill the Vampire, his moral high ground is quickly surrendered at the first chance to make love with Sookie and has no issue with make a quick snack of her (although she remains somewhat unharmed). We find the other vampires not so mainstream as Bill but greatly desiring to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as Happy Meals with legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes, I have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show, its still bad. Somethings die for a reason, even vampires. Maybe this show should to.&#34;,
   &#34;Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven&#39;t seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don&#39;t think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn&#39;t see this movie, even though it&#39;s PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don&#39;t even remember what it was about, once was enough!&#34;,
   &#39;I had the (mis)fortune to see this film at a showing in the US. Having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing, I am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original film was a turkey, but an interesting one. It fitted into that early seventies, post 1969 revolution thing; this film just stinks of....... , well, nothing really. It\&#39;s that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a badly done perfume commercial - see what I mean ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madonna never could act, and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years. She looks worse and worse with every one of those years, increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guy Ritchie, who has built his &#34;reputation&#34; on Lock Stock, could never direct either - his movies are shallow, badly cut, fashion shows. He doesn\&#39;t disappoint here either; he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please people, take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below. They are quite obviously business plants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t encourage Ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;Simply terrible! Why wouldn&#39;t you use actual actors? Look, this has to stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want any credibility or any message sent via these low-budget films...please for the love of god use real actors! Most will work for free...take advantage of that! Now back to my comment...anyway, the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn&#39;t funny on any level. As for the quality...in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew...guess what? It was one guy with what looked like a Sony Camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish...and it wasn&#39;t even good gore.&#34;,
   &#34;This is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way. Sure we like to know what happened 12 years from the last movie, and it works on some level. But the new characters are just not interesting. Baby Melody is hideously horrible! Alas, while the logic that humans can&#39;t stay underwater forever is maintained, other basic physical logic are ignored. It&#39;s chilly if you don&#39;t have cold weather garments if you&#39;re in the Arctic. I don&#39;t know why most comments here Return of Jafar rates worse, I thought this one is more horrible.&#34;,
   &#39;Have I seen a worse movie? Perhaps only &#34;Manos: The Hands of Fate&#34; dragged more than &#34;Dukes&#34;. I had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point. Let\&#39;s touch on a few...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they don\&#39;t respond. He shrugs and moves on, since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he\&#39;s talking about (nor do we). It was like the engine died and was restarted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few times the General Lee flew through the air weren\&#39;t even that exciting. Nothing I haven\&#39;t seen on the TV Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it (although roughly). The rest of the time it seems distant and forced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seann William Scott\&#39;s awful, horrendous accent (or lack thereof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hated Willie Nelson\&#39;s performance. Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing? I wanted him to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film. That\&#39;s telling you how horrible this movie is. She\&#39;s a goddess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the climax of the film, I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear bomb would have sufficed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only we could erase and start over...&#39;,
   &#39;Okay guys, we know why we watch film like &#34;The Invisible Maniac&#34; (just look at the cover, man!). T and A all over the place (with a lot more T than A). But...shouldn\&#39;t there be a story to go with it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;C\&#39;mon,&#34; I can hear you say - &#34;this is just girls gettin\&#39; naked! Who needs a story??!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if this were called &#34;The NAKED Maniacs&#34;, I wouldn\&#39;t have a problem. But since these guys are cribbing from &#34;The Invisible Man&#34;, they need to have a bit of story hereabouts, you know, to keep your mind busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and, when he cracks, uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers. And when you see the smarmy-looking teenagers he goes after, you\&#39;ll be grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star, for the T and A, but there\&#39;s a little too much gore for you skin fans, so proceed with caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIDBIT - yes, it\&#39;s THAT Savannah.&#39;,
   &#39;LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected! He did a fabulous job acting as a &#34;renegade&#34; cop within a &#34;renegade&#34; department. From the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he\&#39;s in. He acts as a sort of &#34;gentle giant&#34; -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job. He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards. After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner. There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have taken a more pivotal role. That he didn\&#39;t was disappointing and a true let-down. I was hoping to see more from him in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. This movie is a typical action movie that (at least initially) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past. Being an action movie, it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes, blood, and guts. These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops/bad-cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What irked me most was the way Timberlake\&#39;s character behaved during shoot-out scenes. He starts out having guns and not using them. Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he\&#39;s been firing a gun his whole life. Then he runs out of bullets and doesn\&#39;t have a gun -- and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo?! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then you\&#39;ll probably love this movie. Personally, it doesn\&#39;t matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic. Make me believe that the story is true. This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied.&#39;,
   &#34;...the child actors were annoying. Also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes. Decent death scenes, though. If not for the death scenes, this movie would have a very Disneyish feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main child protagonist didn&#39;t seem nearly as scared as she should have been. If I was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual, you can bet your arse I wouldn&#39;t be out wandering around and riding my bike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#39;ve seen worse (i.e. It Waits) but it&#39;s nothing I would watch again, or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you&#39;re an avid horror collector.&#34;,
   &#39;During the early 1980\&#39;s, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that. I have no idea what Thomas was paid to make this film, but I would have to be paid a big heap of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in a motion picture. The film is obviously derived from &#34;Enter The Dragon,&#34; as are most martial arts pictures. Only instead of a real martial art, they concoct an absurd new martial art, accurately described by one critic as &#34;a cross between Kung Fu and break dancing.&#34; A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress, yet every room has a prop that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies. Of course, he fights his way to the lead villain, and of course they have a fancy-dancy fight, with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts film. There are touches which nostalgic types will like, particularly the mullet haircuts of Thomas and many of the male co-stars have. But the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wishes he had never set foot on the film set.&#39;,
   &#39;This show is painful to watch ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show, from the ever changing &#34;jobs&#34;, boyfriends, and cast. It appears that they wanted to cast Amanda Bynes in something ... but had no idea what, and came up with this crappy show. They cast her as a teen, surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings, and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy. Soon, they realize that she needs a &#34;clique&#34; and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a &#34;family&#34; show, and thrown it into it\&#39;s afternoon lineup on ABC Family.&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;m 47 years old and I&#39;ve spent as much of my life as I can remember, a fan of horror and sci-fi films. Be they silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few of them that I can&#39;t find something to like about. That said, I&#39;ll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that&#39;s all. This is a case of effects over story. Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn&#39;t been seen in a horror film. Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie doesn&#39;t even have good acting, only good effects. So unless you can only about the gore, pass this one up.&#34;,
   &#34;Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I&#39;M A CYBORG BUT THAT&#39;S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely unexpected, then, to see all Park&#39;s effort add up to so very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;M A CYBORG BUT THAT&#39;S OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, but, try as i might, i could not bring myself to care for any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit, but it still managed to showcase some of the director&#39;s unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, was readily forgiven. None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I&#39;M A CYBORG BUT THAT&#39;S OK left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves no more than a 3. For old time&#39;s sake, i&#39;ll be generous: 4/10&#34;,
   &#39;Unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating closure to the &#34;Nightmare on Elm Street&#34;-series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn Wes Craven\&#39;s initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke. This isn\&#39;t just the worst entry in the &#34;Elm Street&#34; saga; it\&#39;s also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre! The story is dumb, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all murky and \x96 most of all \x96 the special and visual effects resemble those of a Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him around the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it appears that Freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter. You\&#39;d think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures, but no\x85 There\&#39;s only one teenage-survivor in Springwood and Krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure. The John Doe-boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults! How about that: Freddy Krueger, who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers, eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3D-glasses! Sort of like ruins the whole essence, doesn\&#39;t it? As far as I\&#39;m concerned, &#34;Nightmare on Elm Street&#34; has always been a dreadfully overrated series but, up until now, even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements. &#34;Freddy\&#39;s Dead&#34;, however, is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his/her precious time watching it.&#39;,
   &#39;I thought that I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as &#34;The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34;, but this film compete with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started. I woke up, and started to watching it agian. Why did I deserve that? All the movie was a torture, I have to use fast forward to watch it complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can´t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time (MR. WALKEN) could done this thing. I have to think that he made the director a favor, or he was really in the need of money, because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the movie? it´s not scary, stupid plot, characters are awful (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), effects are very poor, lack of deaths &amp; blood, etc; in three words, it has anything. And I mean it. Can´t stand how a director can make a film like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, When I got more disappointed was when I saw in the video cover, that the film was presented by &#34;Stephen King&#34;, I think he could never present this crap, no? (I rented it in Argentina). I not recommend it in a million years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10. (As I say in my &#34;Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34; review, there will be always a worse movies, thats why it don´t deserves a 1 out of 10)&#39;,
   &#39;The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female flesh, and raunchy language. &#34;The Dukes of Hazzard&#34; passed me by; it was not repeated whenever I was in front of the television in either New York or California; or, I probably would have watched. Still, from somewhere (like the clips accompanying this film\&#39;s updated 2005 release), I knew it was about a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and, the &#34;General Lee&#34; is still good to go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hunky cousins Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the New Riders of the Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her skimpy short well - but, even her arousing pink bikini can\&#39;t beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing, topless coeds. The too stupid plot involves a graying Burt Reynolds (as &#34;Boss&#34; Hogg) threatening to turn Hazzard County into a strip-mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds&#39;,
   &#39;I watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that I read about it here by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They definitely saw something in this movie I didn\&#39;t see, that\&#39;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie starts off at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting, then it begins to get logged down and draggy, not to mention completely unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually you find yourself saying: &#34;What?!? He\&#39;s going to do that too? Just how far is he going to go with this thing?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot begins with Jeff Goldblum\&#39;s character, John, going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new store clerk, Auggie Rose, gets killed during the robbery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. This seems a little much, but wait, there\&#39;s more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John becomes totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reasons that never make any kind of logical sense, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful, loving girlfriend, a secure, well-paying job, nice house, nice car, expensive suits--decides he wants to be a loser like Auggie Rose was, and experience life in a low paying job, living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why this dim-witted, half-baked film got favorable reviews I\&#39;ll never know. Sure Goldblum does a good acting job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age -- but unless you have a BIG infatuation with Jeff Goldblum and have to see every film he\&#39;s in, I wouldn\&#39;t recommend this turkey. It\&#39;s approximately two hours of your life you\&#39;re not going to get back - and believe me - you\&#39;ll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over, other than being grateful you\&#39;re not still sitting there watching this film!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;As many agree, Origin is a beautiful anime artistically. The music, graphics, and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works. However, if you are looking for more than this, than I suggest looking else where. The beauty stops short of its appearance, and when it really comes down to plot and characters, there&#39;s nothing special. Action is slow and minimal and the people are flat, corny at times, and do not act realistically. Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there... So, in summary, oh my goodness, I&#39;ve never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my goodness, it&#39;s like... -poke- people don&#39;t act like that. It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization, and unfortunately, there&#39;s not even that much action to make up for that...&#34;,
   &#34;If you enjoy films like American Pie, Road Trip &amp; Van Wilder; avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs. It is an unamusing, mean-spirited, insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst film I have seen in the past 18 months; mind-numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of it&#39;s runtime. Had it been much longer, I would not have been able to write this review without using profanity. Consider yourself warned!&#34;,
   &#34;OK..... This is the third in the series of carnosaur. Lets star with the dinosaur puppets! In the start of the film you cant See the Dino&#39;s cause when the body count starts you can only See the Dino&#39;s eye vision, pretty smart to hide the bad puppets! and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with Scott Valentine as the leader Rance, the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body&#39;s after the Dino rampage, after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream, pretty creepy!!! and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found! It pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can See that its just a guy with a hand puppet!? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist&#39;s attacks some truck cause they though It wash some weapons in there. 2. They where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t-Rex in there! How did the t-Rex fit in there??? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive=( 4. Holy Jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats! 5. The Dino&#39;s is now on a boat in the pacific. 6: Strange i didn&#39;t know that the t-Rex had a strange thing on hes neck??? 7. THE END. The film is good if you want a good laugh. 5/10&#34;,
   &#34;After a lively if predictable opening bank-heist scene, &#39;Set It Off&#39; plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink. This is a movie that deals in nasty, threadbare stereotypes instead of characters, preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting, and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought, wit or feeling. In short, it&#39;s no different from 90% of Hollywood product. But it&#39;s the racial angle that makes &#39;Set It Off&#39; a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making. Posing as a celebration of &#39;sistahood&#39;, the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating Afican-American &#39;gangsta&#39; stereotype. The gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. Worse, &#39;Set It Off&#39; exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. Serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then they&#39;re ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring, guilt-ridden liberals (tell that to Rodney King), and aspirational &#39;good&#39; sista, Jada Pinkett Smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the &#39;hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend. &#39;Set It Off&#39; illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the &#39;hood while all the time despising it. While the likes of &#39;Shaft&#39; and &#39;Superfly&#39; in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. &#39;Set It Off&#39; wouldn&#39;t be worth getting angry over if wasn&#39;t a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of African-American film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s.&#34;,
   &#34;I won&#39;t mention any of the plot, because, although it would be highly predictable anyway, the one notable plot twist is given away everywhere, in the movie comments, in the plot summary here, and even in the synopsis on my Netflix envelope. I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn&#39;t known that. Maybe. This film has a deceptively good cast, most of whom did creditable acting with the rather limited material at hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren, and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible to like William McNamara, but that was clearly by design. And there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the callipygian Lenore Zann. But none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me. Don&#39;t any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before signing on?&#34;,
   &#34;Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children&#39;s tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made.&#34;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and just watched this,the episode that started it all, on British Channel 5. It IS fascinating to think what sprung from this so-so movie and I can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of &#34;Columbo&#34; and added all the little touches that make it such a marvellous &amp; classic series. That said, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode &amp; the patronising British episode). If Columbo had been made as per the original \&#39;pilot\&#39; it certainly would NOT have gone on for very long, or be watched and loved world-wide. In this film Lt Columbo is smartly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, doesn\&#39;t talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive. There\&#39;s also none of the cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and &#34;the villain&#34;. Watchable, but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbo started out.&#39;,
   &#39;Ben Stiller doesn\&#39;t so much act as react. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. In There\&#39;s Something About Mary, the stand-up hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face. When he confronts Mary\&#39;s other two suitors, he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom. Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are too few. Having said that, Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour - you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed (though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile - noticeably through Stiller\&#39;s reaction). However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. Hoffman and Stiller\&#39;s characters could have played off each other much, much more. Aniston again reprises her Rachael role, but Stiller is no Ross. It is more of a &#34;Joey with a crush on Rachael&#34; scenario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polly is a by-the-numbers rom-com and that is its failing - it lacks heart. You don\&#39;t root for the characters. With a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the film\&#39;s failure comes down to poor writing. Worth watching if it pops up on TV on a slow night, but you\&#39;ll regret forking out cash to see it.&#39;,
   &#34;Watched on Hulu (far too many commercials!) so it broke the pacing but even still, it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I&#39;d protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews. They cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them I usually enjoy Indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment, especially for a modern Indian film. The story doesn&#39;t take place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India) but I can&#39;t find out where it is supposed to be happening.&#34;,
   &#39;I was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that I felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off. How any can give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me. I know that the intent of the movie is to shock, but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive (holding back vomit as I type) - PLEASE! I shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby. I had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point. No wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in HMV. I really have no desire to see any other movie by this Uwe person. Anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy. Period.&#39;,
   &#34;I saw this movie a long time ago... luckily it was for free. I have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I don&#39;t remember a whole bunch of it, but I do remember I was incredibly bored, the plot made no sense and when I came out of the theater the only thing I could say was at least now I know what the worst movie I ever saw was. I just was incredibly bothered by one thing: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive, why can&#39;t they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty? How stupid do they think we are?&#34;,
   &#39;I remember going to see the movie in the summer of \&#39;78 with my parents, and being pretty into it at the time. Of course, I was seven at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about mid-way through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this is saying something. Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of budget constraints, the movie -- already a compression of &#34;The Fellowship of the Rings&#34; and part of &#34;The Two Towers&#34; -- was pared down even more. What you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the Cliff Notes of the books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not all bad, though, the animation brings a warmth to it, that I found lacking in the Jackson movies. Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. Several years later, a half-hearted half-hour long TV special was aired, which was meant to wrap things up. All I will say about that is that it was a musical.&#39;,
   &#39;There are movies that are awful, and there are movies that are so awful they are deemed long-forgotten and unwatchable. Also, lots of violence and bad stuff (not just cheesy stuff; you know what I mean) add to the mix as well. What is the result of bad movies with such raunchy content? Why, &#34;Final Justice,&#34; of course! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember &#34;Mitchell?&#34; Joe Don Baker was the star of that movie, and that was riffed by Joel and the Bots on &#34;Mystery Science Theater 3000.&#34; Now this time, with Mike taking Joel\&#39;s place on the Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), that trio got to make fun of MST3K\&#39;s second Joe Don Baker movie, &#34;Final Justice.&#34; Of course, much of the naughty stuff that I mentioned was removed for television release, but still, I want to watch that episode (and &#34;Mitchell&#34; as well), because what does Joe Don &#34;hate&#34; the most? Why, none other than &#34;Mystery Science Theater 3000!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you have a Big Lots nearby, check that store for the uncut tape! LOL That happened to another user!&#39;,
   &#34;I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. That has been done in great detail already, many times over. The &#39;plot&#39; started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy/gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles. Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves. It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled, yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only making these comments, and indeed the only reason I went to see the film, is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second &#39;heavy&#39; in the pub scene. It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan&#39;s face in the bar in &#39;Russia&#39; (it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras&#39; agency and this was his first part. Having seen the film, it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released. I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD, I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot, then jam them into your eye sockets. This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film.&#34;,
   &#34;Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don&#39;t be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. The kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I didn&#39;t like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children&#39;s films ever again. His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cat in the Hat may be the worst kids movie ever.&#34;,
   &#39;What exactly was going on during World War 11 in New Zealand when American forces were there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view. Can you imagine casting Joan Fontaine as the older sister to Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even funnier was that Fontaine becomes pregnant in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piper Laurie and Paul Newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in &#34;The Hustler,&#34; have no scenes together in this film. Laurie plays another sister who goes off to Wellington to tramp around there, despite the fact that she is married. Woe to her when her husband comes back from the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean Simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued Paul Newman. There is even romance for the young Miss Dee here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture has little to no meaning. Are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war? If they are, they did a poor job in selling this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly disposed of. That is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957.&#39;,
   &#39;This film is another example of the curse of east Asian cinema: two or more separate stories rolled into one film. Other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the &#34;first part&#34; and &#34;second part&#34;. How can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time? I was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped (it didn\&#39;t &#34;end&#34;, it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy\&#39;s apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai is given a decent script to work with!&#39;,
   &#39;My flatmate rented out this film the other night, so we watched it together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first impression is actually a positive one, because the whole movie is shot in this colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Fast sequences, cool angles, sweeping camera moves - for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another &#34;Snatch&#34;, for the moment....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the plot actually starts unfolding, one starts to feel as if one over-dosed amphetamine. things just don\&#39;t make sense anymore. i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes, but then again, the film is so bad that you are actually better off NOT watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever. Rather on the contrary, Domino\&#39;s lesbian come on on Lucy Liu\&#39;s character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter. In any case, that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But after that the question of Domino\&#39;s character is entirely lost to the criminal plot. So in short, NO this is NOT a movie about Domino\&#39;s character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then i thought, it\&#39;s probably a story of one robbery. A pretty bloody robbery. 10 millions went missing, bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers, mafia kids are executed, hands are removed, Domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates, etc. But soon this impression is dispelled by another U-turn of the plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese Afro-American woman, who fakes driver\&#39;s licenses at the local MVD and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars on Jerry Springer show, tries to publicize some new, wacky racial theory, and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this have to do with the main plot? URgh, well, nobody knows. Except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors\&#39; fee of 300,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then at some point you start to think: &#34;Oh, it is about our society and the way media distorts things&#34;. There is reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage. The bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a movie about media, they just appear sporadically throughout the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus there are numerous other sub-plots: the crazy Afghani guy bent on liberating Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the FBI surveillance operation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it is a veritable mess!&#39;,
   &#39;Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse\&#39;s &#34;Star 80&#34; about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful &#34;poodlesque&#34; hair-do....Very disappointing....&#34;Paper Moon&#34; and &#34;The Last Picture Show&#34; I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten\&#39;s tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!&#39;,
   &#39;As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are comic book bold. I think the director got carried away with his &#34;artistic vision&#34; over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content. Despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent. Madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press. A good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album &#34;I\&#39;m Breathless (Music inspired by the film Dick Tracy)&#34; which was a stratospheric hit (due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit &#34;Vogue&#34; - which is not in, nor has the slightest relation to this film). I\&#39;d guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to Madonna\&#39;s &#34;I\&#39;m Breathless&#34; album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you watch it at home, by end-titles, you\&#39;ll think &#34;there\&#39;s two hours out of my life I\&#39;d like to have back.&#34; Save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this.&#39;,
   &#34;Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. THERE WE GO. NOW we know this movie is going to be really horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But not even I thought it would be THIS bad. The plot is awful, Van Damme is getting old (finally), but unlike Arnold, his movies are as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget this movie. Don&#39;t see it. Ever. I wouldn&#39;t even be paid to see this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/5 stars - at its heart lies a wonderful, action-packed thrill ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, maybe not, but the marketers would sure like us to think so, wouldn&#39;t they?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Ulmer&#34;,
   &#34;This film is about a man&#39;s life going wrong. His business is failing, and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is complete chaos. It simply does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the film makes sense. The story is so poorly told that I simply could not understand it. It is a shame, because the sets and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulating enough. The shots are well composed throughout the film. However, these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling. I am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film. It is such a waste of their talents. This film is very bad. Avoid it!!&#34;,
   &#39;This is one of the worst things to ever come out of England, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing though. The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too although none of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal. There is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of &#34;The Sixth Sense&#34; only a lot more dull and British. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in nothing, plus the electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself... ummm... A British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good although not one of there bests.&#39;,
   &#39;With that line starts one silly, boring British sci fi film. The Great Vorelli from the movie &#34;Devil Doll&#34; builds a teleportation machine only to have his funding cut off by Blanchard, a bearded man who has a thing for bow ties and men with large eye brows. When his experiment fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all of the grants in the world, will be staying in London for a few days. He attempts to project himself into the house of Blanchard with the help of his comely lab assistant, Sheila. Needless to say something goes wrong and he winds up looking like a rat. The rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around London shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face. There are some more killings, some modest paper work, and finally, the doctor vanishes to where ever rat faced doctors go. Thankfully no one decided to make a sequel.&#39;,
   &#39;My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you have seen the BBC\&#39;s &#34;Planet Earth&#34; , which I am sure most of you have , then you are not gonna like this movie too much. And I own all the discs of &#34;Planet Earth&#34; I had seen the rating for this movie very high , and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started , I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs at home of &#34;Planet Earth&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie continued and went on and on and on , me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from &#34;Planet Earth&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were very very disappointed , as I think 90% of the footage is from &#34;Planet Earth&#34; . I am saying 90% , because some of the scenes I didn\&#39;t recognize. I have a feeling that I simply didn\&#39;t remember them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So finally what this movie really is , is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of &#34;Planet Earth&#34; , with a narration aimed at kids. Yes, the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub , the narrator says &#34;The polar cubs are not like human kids. They don\&#39;t always listen to their mothers&#34; ( I don\&#39;t remember the exact words , but this is how it is ) So in a nutshell. This is condensed &#34;Planet Earth&#34; for kids !&#39;,
   &#39;A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64, which bypasses the Ocean View area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed, Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile, in the past few years, the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film &#34;Rollercoaster&#34;. This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to &#34;Death of Ocean View Park&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the film itself, the storyline of a &#34;supernatural&#34; force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for B-grade movies of the time. With the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I don\&#39;t believe this film was intended to be another &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; &#34;let\&#39;s come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the casual movie viewer, this would be a &#34;see once and forget about it&#34; film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park, this movie is like a &#34;walk down memory lane&#34; for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk, the first &#34;Harborfest&#34;, and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome.&#39;,
   &#34;I would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time... When i&#39;ve seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our (Kazakhstan) government... It&#39;s a shame, because &#39;Qazaqfil&#39;m&#39; was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually ran by him. The movies like &#39;Konec Atamana&#39;, &#39;Kyz Zhibek&#39; or even &#39;Aldar Kose&#39;. But after Mr Aimanov&#39;s death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced. However, in late 1980s, &#39;Assa&#39; was shot, it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country, one year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the co-staring of the same actor/singer V.Tsoy, at that time he was already a soviet/Russian rock legend, - the movie called &#39;Igla&#39; (The Needle or something) it was completely new, somebody called that period as resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies, our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support, and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics, some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products... And again back to our &#39;nomads&#39;. Such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects. The same effects was with Nikita Mikhalkov&#39;s &#39;Sibirski Cyrilnik&#39; about Russian tsars, that was also shot on parities with foreign partners, i think they were french or maybe British. Nobdy liked it, even in Russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like &#39;KVN&#39;. IMHO&#34;,
   &#34;Jude Law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value. Completely lacking in eroticism, excitement, or leading ladies with appeal. One decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. And a one-note plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between Law&#39;s character and a dogged homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are staked to the cross of the film&#39;s banality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a lesser actor in the lead role -- and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis&#39;s cinematography -- Crocodiles would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.&#34;,
   &#39;Just imagine the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a mumbling moron as Carlyle portrayed him in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a Hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself, disguised as &#34;true history&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show. Carlyle and the producers didn\&#39;t get anything right with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why was Hitler able to win so many people, a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable. This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a disgrace and I wonder how they could talk an actor like Carlyle into this dreck.&#39;,
   &#39;The photography on the DVD is so dark I thought the screen had died. I think I missed seeing half of the movie. Still, it was poorly crafted and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title &#34;The Black Widow&#34;. I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames. I rented the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent. I do not believe Giada Colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture. She is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem believable. I do not understand why the other characters were even introduced into the plot.&#39;,
   &#39;This is not so much film as big budget children\&#39;s television. As far as I can tell, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as \&#39;Insomnia\&#39;. When it\&#39;s first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, I thought &#34;Wow! A nihilistic martial arts film!&#34; but no such luck. Although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man\&#39;s long, white eyebrows. Zu Warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off. That\&#39;s not a good sign. I found the special effects to be somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.&#39;,
   &#34;Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein&#39;s niece! Although he&#39;s on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it&#39;s easy to forget he&#39;s even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it&#39;s sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from ****&#34;,
   &#39;Repetitive music, annoying narration, terrible cinematography effects. Half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best scenes was in the &#34;deleted scenes&#34; section, the one where she\&#39;s in the principle\&#39;s office with her mom. I don\&#39;t understand why they\&#39;d cut that. The movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and Domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of MTV, and completely not needed or helpful to a movie. Speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used. It\&#39;s like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didn\&#39;t want to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? That should\&#39;ve told me not to watch it from the preview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A popular movie for the &#34;in&#34; crowd.&#39;,
   &#34;Being a fan of cheesy horror movies, I saw this in my video shop and thought I would give it a try. Now that I&#39;ve seen it I wish it upon no living soul on the planet. I get my movie rentals for free, and I feel that I didn&#39;t get my moneys worth. I&#39;ve seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time, hell I&#39;m a fan of them, but this was just an insult.&#34;,
   &#39;I have never seen a movie as bad as this. It is meant to be a &#34;fun&#34; movie, but the only joke is at the start, and it is NOT funny. If you like this sort of movie, then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2. If it had the necessary votes, it would truly belong on the bottom 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;WARNING! SMALL PLOT DETAILS REVEALED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film. It is written so badly that every character is a caricature, yet it seems to take itself seriously. It is poorly cast, especially Ralph Macchio (all baby-faced, 5-foot-nothing of him) as a streetwise tough. Plot elements are all drawn in black and white, with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most egregious of all (PLOT ELEMENT ABOUT TO BE REVEALED) it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi-serious film. One can just imagine the filmmakers saying, &#34;We need JoBeth to shed her top...hmmm...I\&#39;ve got it!...early in the film, let\&#39;s give Nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways...then JoBeth can use that line on him later and REALLY bare herself in the hallway...yeah, that\&#39;s the ticket!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984, one that proved all too weighty in the late 90\&#39;s with events like Columbine. However, the execution is dreadful. This film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of &#34;Heathers&#34;, a campy political statement like &#34;Network&#34; or a serious examination like &#34;Brubaker&#34;. Instead, it tries to be all of these things -- and ends up being none of these things. &#34;Teachers&#34; get an F.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;d have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the \&#39;King of the Cowboys\&#39;; made in 1948, the picture came out a decade after Roy Rogers\&#39; earliest pictures in which he had a starring role. Roy\&#39;s character comes off as a bit clueless in this one, along with his female co-star Jane Frazee, who alternates her allegiance between Roy and Robert Livingston, portraying chief bad guy Bill Regan. The whole story seems kind of muddled, with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so. Like the legend of the \&#39;Hangman\&#39;s Hotel\&#39; for example, which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight. With Andy Devine in the cast as Cookie Bullfincher, you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up. Instead, you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a Bowery Boys flick. It was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old Genevieve, who truth be told, wound up getting more screen time than Trigger, who\&#39;s contract as \&#39;Smartest Horse in the Movies\&#39; didn\&#39;t have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule. And then you have Foy Willing and his Riders of the Purple Sage replacing Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers for your musical interlude. I don\&#39;t know about you, but it was already half way into the picture and I was still looking for Pat Brady - oh well! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough, and that turned out to be Roy\&#39;s athletic dismount of Trigger while still on the run from the bad guys. OK, it was probably a stunt double, but I haven\&#39;t seen that one before in a couple hundred Westerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jane Frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture, as she would in four other films opposite Roy in the 1947/1948 time frame. In &#34;Under California Stars&#34;, she appeared as Andy Devine\&#39;s cousin, appropriately named Caroline Bullfincher. You\&#39;re never quite convinced what side she\&#39;ll come in on in this story though, since she starts out pretending to be someone she\&#39;s not, and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fans of the old Laurel and Hardy films might be as surprised as I was to see James Finlayson here as the Sheriff of Sintown. I would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role, but he played it pretty straight after all. I had to wonder, when it was all over, why he and old Vanderpool (Charle Coleman) wound up in the mine shaft with Cookie when there was no reason for that to be. Just a way to close it out I guess, with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture. I hate to be that harsh, but if you\&#39;ve seen enough Roy Rogers flicks, you\&#39;ve got to know that this was not one of his finer efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say, Sintown - I wonder if that\&#39;s the same place that grew up to be Sin City?&#39;,
   &#39;I love B movies..but come on....this wasn\&#39;t even worth a grade...The ending was dumb...b/c THERE WAS NO REAL ENDING!!!..not to mention that it comes to life on its own...I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers?? Slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period...and i won\&#39;t even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head....and then you don\&#39;t even get to see what Jigsaw even does with his so called &#34;new jigsaw puzzle&#34;....Unless you have nothing better to do...Id watch paint dry before Id recommend this God-forsaken movie to anyone else...oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window..that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film&#39;,
   &#39;THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN\&#39;S MOVIE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is like a &#34;bad acid trip&#34; for kids under the age of 5. For a month my 4 year old from time-to-time would ask me &#34;Why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth&#34; or &#34;Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?&#34;. (And that wasn\&#39;t the worst of it). We stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately he\&#39;s finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing. Whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges. ... (Go ahead censure me, my conscience is clear.).&#39;,
   &#39;Someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo-gritty look is somehow seen as &#34;realistic&#34; by some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn\&#39;t see anything realistic about the characters (although the actors did their best with really bad parts) or the situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort at being &#34;edgy&#34;, &#34;gritty&#34; and &#34;down and dirty&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it takes a lot more than hand-holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies, with bad cinematography, non-existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as &#34;Art&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s little wonder that films like &#34;In the Bedroom&#34; or &#34;About Schmidt&#34; get such raves. I found them to be meandering and very average, but compared to the current slew of independent clones like &#34;Raising victor Vargas&#34; they are outright brilliant and inspired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago seeing an &#34;independent&#34; film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets, nowadays, it means that chances are you\&#39;ll get yet another by-the-numbers, let\&#39;s-shake-the-camera-around-for-two-hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies? Not at all when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them.&#39;,
   &#39;A youth gets a bad hair day, goes out on a hill, and falls into where he can\&#39;t escape. Then, he meets MR. ATLAS, a &#34;mythological&#34; dude from 2,000 years ago as his very best friend, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger look-and-sound-alike. His Herculean strength helps the boy out of danger, and later adjusts to modern life. So what\&#39;s the big deal? This is the lousiest idea for a &#34;family&#34; outing! Either way, this one shouldn\&#39;t have been attempted at all, really! Our fictional character of might and brawn is nothing more than a typical stranger who appears ordinary to the rest of the universe. To add to the blasphemy is the lack of anything new or appealing, and before you know it, there is some attempted violence that doesn\&#39;t qualify this as &#34;family&#34; entertainment. The scene where Atlas complains of his undershorts is gaggling, though. Just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.&#39;,
   &#39;Brilliant actor as he is, Al Pacino completely derails Revolution \x96 his Method acting approach is totally ill-suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the American War of Independence. Much of the blame should be attributed to director Hugh Hudson (yes, the man who made Chariots Of Fire just a couple of years earlier \x96 talk about a come-down!!). One of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors, coaxing believable performances from them, but in this case Hudson has allowed Pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind. It\&#39;s not just Al\&#39;s career-low performance that hinders the film though: there are numerous other flaws with Revolution, more of which will be said later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illiterate trapper Tom Dobb (Al Pacino) lives in the north-eastern region of America with his son Ned (Sid Owen/Dexter Fletcher). He leads a simple life \x96 living off the land, raising his son, surviving against the elements. The country is lorded over by the English colonialists, but during an eight year period (1775-83) a revolution takes place which ends with the British being defeated and the independent American nation being born. Dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the Continental Army \x96 swept away by events they can barely understand, the Dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another. Tom also falls in love with Daisy McConnahay (Natassja Kinski), a beautiful and fiery woman of British aristocratic ancestry. Their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to start with the film\&#39;s flaws? Most key actors are miscast \x96 Pacino has been criticised enough already, but Kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while Donald Sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless English soldier with a wobbly Yorkshire accent. Robert Dillon\&#39;s script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level. At no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the American Revolution as a backdrop, or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along. As a result, the narrative falls into no man\&#39;s land, flitting from &#34;grand spectacle&#34; to &#34;small story&#34; indiscriminately and meaninglessly. John Corigliano\&#39;s score is quite ghastly, and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety. Hugh Hudson\&#39;s direction is clumsy throughout, both in his mismanagement of Pacino and the other key actors, and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences. The idea of the hand-held camera is to create immediacy \x96 that feeling of &#34;being there&#34; in the confusion of battle and musket fire. Like so many other things in the film, it doesn\&#39;t work. The one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail, with costumes, sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate. But if it\&#39;s period detail you\&#39;re interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time, because as a rousing cinematic experience Revolution doesn\&#39;t even begin to make the grade. Nothing more than a £18,000,000 mega-bomb that the ailing British film industry could ill afford in the mid-1980s.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie should have never been made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a shame of the budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please hire convincing actors, and make a proper movie. Very thin plot, and unconvincing lines. Almost hilarious, and that is a shame for an action movie.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They keep replaying the same &#34;shots&#34; of an Stealth airplane flying away. You have seen it ones, and that was not worth re-running 3 or 4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is time for Steven Seagal to retire from movie-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His movies are getting worser every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black Dawn, and Submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse.&#39;,
   &#39;This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn\&#39;t that great. Sure, &#34;CHAOS&#34; and &#34;INSIDE MAN&#34; are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I found &#34;CHAOS&#34; more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film &#34;Swordfish.&#34; The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and &#34;Chaos&#34; was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that doesn\&#39;t mean that it is a pleasant film to watch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it if nothing else is on T.V., but you\&#39;ll probably get bored with after awhile.&#39;,
   &#39;Two old buddies are sent to Japan to get back results of a genetic research containing videotape, which is stolen by the black suited ninjas at the beginning of the movie. First they just have to learn some ninja skill, because &#34;only ninja can beat the ninja.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sakura killers tries hard to be enjoyable ninja-flick but fails that badly. The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it: Same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before, characters are too briefly drawn, direction is dull and script doesn\&#39;t offer anything surprising, even in the ending scene, which by itself reduced movie\&#39;s (trash)value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even 80\&#39;s ninja-flick-fan, who understands the esthetic of trash-movies, is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable. It simply doesn\&#39;t offer anything new to viewer, neither in visual level nor in plot. Shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging, but it\&#39;s not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and recurred similar fighting scenes numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s hard to recommend movie to anyone. Even Franco Nero\&#39;s clumsy performance in &#34;Enter the Ninja&#34; falls behind Sakura killer\&#39;s American-ninjas. Even in visual level movie doesn\&#39;t have any balls and it\&#39;s waste of time to try to find any great fighting scenes in this movie: There isn\&#39;t any. In all, one of the most futile ninja-flicks, I\&#39;ve ever seen. Doesn\&#39;t interest even in curiosity. Trust me on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;½ out of 10.&#39;,
   &#34;Let me start off by saying that this doesn&#39;t seem or feel like a movie. It seems like just another TV show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it. This film takes us to where no movie I&#39;ve seen has done before: to a realm where the Film Theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation. Too obvious. The large movie screen is only used as an enlarged TV from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately it seems that young directors are compromising the Art of film making for sales. This is very scary. The industry is spoiling the art in movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks.&#34;,
   &#34;I actually didn&#39;t enjoy this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it at a camp, and we didn&#39;t rave about it, we laughed at it. Sure, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole overall movie idea is terrible (now, I know it was based on a book which I haven&#39;t read, but I hope that the book was better than this, because frankly, I thought that this movie was very bad and boring). Like I said, I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus I got a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, I struggled to stay awake. The only thing that kept me up (other than my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up) was the gunshots, that were quite pointless as well. I just really didn&#39;t like it.&#34;,
   &#34;Be warned! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is crap that other crap won&#39;t even deign to be in company with because it&#39;s beneath them! Okay, got that out of the way, let me say something more substantive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite of all of that WKW hasn&#39;t succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans; mostly it is just shots of dripping water, beads of sweats, legs of horses running, etc. I couldn&#39;t sit through most of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wong&#39;s movies another shot after hearing many praises, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start w/ Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It&#39;s all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it. But no, he merely shows what is. Faye Wong&#39;s acting is very typical of Hong Kong&#39;s style: garbled enunciation, deer in the headlight wide eye expression, try to be cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the word, Auteur, is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different, which is to be applauded, but not one who hasn&#39;t yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling, which is what Mr. Wong is, for the last 17 years!&#34;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m actually watching this film as I write this . . . If the following comments &#34;prove my lack of development as a true, artistic film maker&#34;, then so be it . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But . . . I thought (am still thinking as I\&#39;m presently viewing) that this film . . . to put it mildly, is very, very overrated. Again, very.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a really, really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources . . . and who didn\&#39;t pay that much attention to detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that I find this film lacking, but . . . well . . . I just don\&#39;t get it (rememeber, I fully admit that maybe it\&#39;s ME that\&#39;s the idiot here - not the film maker - for not getting this &#34;piece of imaginative genius&#34;) . . . I rented this on a whim because the reviews were very, very outstanding . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheesh . . .&#39;,
   &#39;This must be accompanied by a special rating and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The obsession of Daneliuc with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare. Also, it\&#39;s evident that the man is a misanthrope, he hates everybody - his country his people, his actors, his job. And this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This so called &#34;film&#34; is just a hideous string of disgusting images, with no artistic value and no professionist knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and to good sense. Shame, shame, shame!&#39;,
   &#39;The subject matter seems pretty dated today. Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe\&#39;s book; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence. Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deep. His co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game\&#39;s foursome. Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this date, it seems lumbering and tame. But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his &#34;Bosom Buddies&#34; salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment.&#39;,
   &#39;Recherche is a good word to describe this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s say every movie has a selling point, a gimmick. Transformers\&#39; gimmick is the awesome effects as well as fan boys nostalgia. Sleepless in Seattle\&#39;s gimmick is situational in their tag-line, &#34;What if someone you never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only someone for you?&#34; Many romance relies heavily on these gimmicks and some through draw of big names. Leap Years employs both by using the Irish folklore as the circumstance and featuring considerably famous names within the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now that the audience are in the cinema, besides all the usual elements in characters, conflict or consequences, crisis, resolve and denouement, they also look forward to stimulating dialog, more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years, interesting sub-plots and perhaps, to a certain extent, a good twist in the middle or towards the end of the story that favors the circumstances of the characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what Jean Yeo is trying not to achieve. If they\&#39;ve tried to, their goal was apparently in the other court, at the other stadium, on the other end of the planet. She and her writer, Alain Layrac, utterly failed to provide stimulating dialog. Most of the lines were contrived. It seems that they have a bag filled with lines which she would like to use in her movie: &#34;Okay, these are the lines and quotes which I\&#39;ve heard or read from either movies I\&#39;ve seen or books I\&#39;ve read before and they all sound good to me. If they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience. Therefore, all i have to do is piece them all together. I am going to use all of them.&#34; The result is cathartic. I can\&#39;t say that the lines were unnecessary and bears no relation to the story or in driving the plot on, but they seem to spring out of nowhere, catching you off guard with these quotable quotes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a personal level, i know people who cite quotes based on most of the situations in our dialog, trying to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding along. I don\&#39;t go out with them anymore because the urge to punch them is overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the characters portrayed are silly and one-dimensional. With exception to the unnatural dialog which implies their motivation (necessary to drive the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. I haven\&#39;t an idea who they are. They are all simpletons spouting lines from the advice column of a female-oriented magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story on because the circumstances are too shallow. Then again, there are movies with less but fared better than this, aren\&#39;t there. They made it up with my first and second point. Moreover, the sub-plots are inconsequential (not that it\&#39;s a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass off the terrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to attain the approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography, soundtrack and filming location. These non-discerning viewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it\&#39;s good. It is just bad. Don\&#39;t watch this.&#39;,
   &#39;This picture reminds me of a Keneth More picture from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton&#34; whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant. Madonna did OK in some movies however this one doesn\&#39;t fire. If there is any picture that show Madonna can\&#39;t act it is this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of &#34;The Admirable Crighton&#34; but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then Hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad. to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is loose and the acting is mediocre. The script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location. While many here have canned Madoona for all her acting I think that in films like &#34;A League of Their own&#34; was quite good and enjoyable and &#34;Who\&#39;s That Girl&#34; showed a quirkiness of Madonna\&#39;s style not shown before or afterwards. Other Madonna films are not as enjoyable and I would have liked a to see a Madonna Animation series with the character from &#34;Who\&#39;s That Girl&#34; I like the music from these two films however &#34;Swept away&#34; remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everyone has a bomb right?&#39;,
   &#34;Nell Shipman attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in &#39;Back to God&#39;s Country&#39; of the previous year, and she failed miserably. This time, she does better, although it seems pointless. &#39;Something New&#39; hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase. There&#39;s a brief premise, which sets up the hero (co-author and Shipman&#39;s boyfriend) to have to save the girl (played by Shipman), then it&#39;s nothing but an exciting, implausible chase from there. Of course, it plays out like an hour-long advertisement for a Maxwell Sedan, but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous. It doesn&#39;t seem that she learned much from the last-minute rescue films of D.W. Griffith or its parodies by Mack Sennett and other comedians, which she&#39;s imitating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point of interest is that Shipman writes and directs herself into the film as the writer of the film&#39;s story, which has as its protagonist a writer (Shipman again), although she doesn&#39;t do much else clever or humorous with it, even though she attempts to. Again, others had pioneered the writer&#39;s joke in the intertitles, like Anita Loos with &#39;Wild and Woolly&#39; or Frances Marion with &#39;A Girl&#39;s Folly&#39; (both 1917). At least, Shipman gives the impression that she doesn&#39;t take herself or the film seriously--and neither do I. &#39;Something New,&#39; despite its claim, is hackneyed.&#34;,
   &#39;Let me confess. I found this video used and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. Besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of &#34;invisible-man&#34; genre special effects (highly visible strings and other such paraphernalia), the script wasted no chance -- in fact it went out of its way -- in insulting all non-WASP races and real-or-imagined homosexuals. Every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. It starts to grate on your nerves, along with the shaky sound, candid- camera style photography and melodramatic story. However, the end is somewhat of a surprise. But by the time you get there, you hardly care less. Too bad, it could been a reasonably good movie.&#39;,
   &#39;This show is dull, lame, and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it &#34;original.&#34; First off: The animation is so ugly... Johnny\&#39;s hideous... and everyone\&#39;s annoying. The twins look like teen female Dexters from &#34;Dexter\&#39;s Lab,&#34; and Johnny is almost like a more intelligent male Dee Dee (also from &#34;Dexter\&#39;s Lab.&#34;) Secondly: The plots... are painfully lame, making them hard to follow. The gags are corny, and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit... especially when it tries to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but those alone turned me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third off: The whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to Green Day\&#39;s &#34;American Idiot.&#34; And, while I am not a big fan of that band, I find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody, and then subtly change it, in order to make it their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case in point... it\&#39;s a big fat ugly bore. 1/10&#39;,
   &#34;I really can&#39;t understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star... How can you like such a retarded film, where all the animal abuse scenes are real? I don&#39;t even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments... Jesus... What kind of &#39;&#39;human&#39;&#39; would torture them like that for no reason, or just for money? I tell you, that director is either mentally retarded, or he&#39;s just a monster with a &#39;&#39;heart&#39;&#39; of stone. Or both. He truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock, especially to sensitive persons and children: a real frog is skinned alive, fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, birds are thrown into the water...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is more than awful; it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made, along with another one, called &#39;&#39;Cannibal Holocaust&#39;&#39; or something like that. I&#39;ll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste their time watching it, especially when there are a lot of TRULY great movies out there, in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, only a few people liked this - which is natural, since it&#39;s the worst film ever -, so it wasn&#39;t successful. I hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to REAL animals will NEVER be praised, and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films. I truly believe that everyone receives but what they give! There will be a day when all the retarded and cruel &#39;&#39;humans&#39;&#39; will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, however, is probably my only &#39;&#39;negative&#39;&#39; review. I usually don&#39;t comment on a movie if I dislike it, but this time I just couldn&#39;t shut up. I had to speak the truth, because animal abuse must stop!&#34;,
   &#39;Title: Zombie 3 (1988) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2. That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK so, after that flick (named Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge chunk of cash, the Italians decided, heck. Lets make some more zombie flicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we\&#39;ve seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Lets see...there\&#39;s the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister gets released into the general population and shebang! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They gotta fight the zombies to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First and foremost, Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick. So he couldn\&#39;t really finish this film the way that he wanted to. The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. You see Fulci himself didn\&#39;t really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: &#34;Do whatever the hell you want with it!&#34; And god love them, they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its &#34;director&#34;. The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! There\&#39;s no substance to it whatsoever! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 there\&#39;s a lot of gore and guts involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we get neither! Well there\&#39;s some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. That was cool. There\&#39;s also a scene involving a flying zombie head (wich by the way defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. But aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Endless upon endless scenes that don\&#39;t do jack to move the already non existent plot along. That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a z-level flick, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zombie make up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines) so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. Its the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up (more like smudges) on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up, but it still wasn\&#39;t good enough to impress. Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead folks! Anyhows, for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick don\&#39;t come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else\&#39;s flick. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) didn\&#39;t really put there heart and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he doesn\&#39;t even take it to seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they &#34;just had a job to do and they did it&#34;. And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. There\&#39;s no love, and no heart put into making this film. Therefore you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made. Everybody else, don\&#39;t even bother! Rating: 1 out of 5&#39;,
   &#39;This movie had the potential to be far more than it was. But it not only fails to deliver, it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Cusack is even flatter than he was in Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent, which he noticeably loses several times each scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al Pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck. He\&#39;s good as usual but hardly standout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supporting cast -- throw in female romantic interest which added little, if anything, to the story. Speaking of the story, a convoluted &#34;who really cares&#34; tale where Cusack is the self-righteous Mayor\&#39;s boy who just has to search for &#34;the right thing&#34; to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People don\&#39;t act this way. Cusack\&#39;s character loses all credibility at the end, of which without revealing it, is preach and nauseous. The final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound. It\&#39;s also completely inaccurate but I won\&#39;t get into law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bad, by the numbers movie. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it\&#39;s really a preachy, proselytizing, self-righteous film for the last hour. Better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk.&#39;,
   &#34;This has to be the WORST movie ever!!! The acting is scarier than the movie. Lots of blood, but no idea where it comes from, cuz they don&#39;t even show you the cuts. I can&#39;t believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. This is a disgrace to horror films!!! For one if they are in Asia why is there a white cop driving past Waste Management trash cans?! There&#39;s so much of another language that you don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on half the time. The film editing is a joke, my teenager could do better. And if I went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working the window that would be the first clue. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! NOT TO EVEN SEE HOW BAD IT IS, YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU DID!!&#34;,
   &#39;(There are Spoilers) Homicidal nymphomaniac hooker Miya, Kari Wuhrer,takes over the life and car of 18 virgin, even though he\&#39;s too embarrassed to admit it, collage freshmen Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the movie Myia not only deflowers but give poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson in how to spot a dangerous nut job and keep as far away for him, or her,in order to keep from ending up turning into one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanging around a trucker rest-stop Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy action, in the back seat of his buggy. Roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is non other then his estranged daughter! Outraged that Miya is reluctant to get it on with him Roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by first year collage student Trent Colbert who plows into the rest-area side swiping one of the truckers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing her chance Miya jumps into Trent\&#39;s car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest car chase ever put into a movie. Going all across the North Eastern USA the two end up involved in a truck car smash-up a murder and a shootout with the state troopers that then leads to Trent\&#39;s parents home, with them being held hostage. It\&#39;s there that there\&#39;s another wild shootout between the crazed Miya with an entire SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state troopers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would expect a movie like &#34;Hit and Run&#34; to be intentionally or unintentionally funny but it\&#39;s not. In fact the film is very disturbing in how Miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and child-molesting father Roy. Getting Trent to drive her all over the North-East Miya gets the poor slob drunk having it on with him in a motel room, together with whips handcuffs and a lighted candle. Miya also gets it on with the motel owner the horny Mr. Foster by tricking him into giving her his gun, as being part of some weird sex game. After holding Foster up she takes off with Trent\&#39;s, who out cold in his motel room, wallet with some $400.00 in it yet doesn\&#39;t bother to drive away with his car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needing the money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for Thanksgiving Trent gets a call on his cellphone from Miya to pick her up at a local diner to get his money back. Like the jerk that he is Trent picks up Miya, who\&#39;s now a fugitive from he law, and later gets involved with her father Roy on the open highway as he tries to run both Trent &amp; Miya off the road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chase ends up in this deserted wear-house that Roy chases Miya,out running him on a muddy road in high-heels, into with him getting it in the you know where with a blast from his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take his pants off that he forgot he left the gun unattended. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With both a holdup and murder, as well as a hit and run, charge against them the two desperadoes stop off at a S&amp;M/Tattoo boutique where Trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed up in leather and chains, by Myri, together with a matching his and hers dog collar. This in order to meet his straight-laced and conservative parents for Thanksgiving Dinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a running shootout with the state troopers, with one of them ending up badly injured,the two fugitives from the law end up at Trent\&#39;s parents Mr &amp; Mrs Colbet, David Keith &amp; Elaine Martyn home with the entire local police force, with a SWAT team, waiting for them there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obnoxious movie with a truly disturbing final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was trying,if at all, to tell it\&#39;s audience. You felt a lot of sympathy for Miya at first but as the movie rolled along to it\&#39;s downbeat ending that evaporated as fast as a tray of ice cubs in Death Valley. Even though Roy was the most unlikable person in the movie at first by the time the film ended Miya totally eclipsed him.&#39;,
   &#34;If it wasn&#39;t for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as the clueless stoners, I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion, which takes place in a supposed abandon high school(looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick), and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on. This student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Hughes falls in love with his characters too much, as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady(Goonies&#39; Anne Ramsey). We&#39;re led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed, but never see a blasted thing! This is a horrible movie that continued National Lampoon&#39;s downward spiral throughout the 80s and 90s.&#34;,
   &#39;i guess its possible that I\&#39;ve seen worse movies, but this one is a real stinker! the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it. the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching. he\&#39;s capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;angie harmon, playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who\&#39;s behind the assassination of the president, truly butchered the role. there was no chemistry with gooding, her demeanor was flat and wooden, and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd. this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the &#34;b&#34; list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and what was cuba gooding thinking??? he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances, but this was far beneath what we\&#39;ve come to expect from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;poor james woods and burt reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor.&#39;,
   &#34;Once upon a time some evil people made a movie about a guy that got shot into space, supposedly to go to Saturn, but really only to some stock footage of solar flares, and then he gets a nose bleed, and before you know it, he&#39;s laying in a hospital bandaged head to foot, and then an overweight nurse with an ill-fitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy, whose supposed to be melting all over the place but never seems to lose any mass, and then NASA, or at least one guy at NASA, gets upset about it and calls one other guy in to hunt him down, but the guy they sent to hunt the melting guy has to go home and have soup first, and his oddly-shaped wife forgot the crackers, so he can&#39;t have crackers, and then he has to go out and look for the melting guy with a geiger counter, and that doesn&#39;t really work, so he really only follows the trail of half-eaten corpses, and then there&#39;s something about a sheriff, and two ugly old people in a lemon grove, and a women with a meat cleaver, and some kind of industrial plant with trigger-happy security guards, and since I can&#39;t tell you how the movies ends, all I can say is Jonathan Demme is in it somewhere with some guy with the stupid name of Burr DeBenning, and if there&#39;s any justice in the world everyone connected with this movie died a hideous, violent death and was unable to make more movies, and the world lived HAPPILY EVER AFTER - THE END!&#34;,
   &#34;Anyone that has see Tammuz&#39;s Child Eaters knows that this is a director that can do better. Let&#39;s hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot (Telefilm anyone?)and that is was a case of second feature jitters. The characters are one dimensional and over used. The scenery is terrific however and showcases the Pacific Northwest beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography is great. Shot almost entirely outside, the images are crisp and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically this movie is as sound as they come - it just lacks a heart.&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;ll be blunt. I&#39;m not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who&#39;s not going to take any crap from anyone. If any one of the cast members wanted to, they could have just taken her out in a heartbeat. It was entertaining on MST 3K, but don&#39;t rent the real version. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?&#34;,
   &#34;I saw this last week after picking up the DVD cheap. I had wanted to see it for ages, finding the plot outline very intriguing. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the lead actor was very flat. This kind of part required a performance like Johny Depp&#39;s in The Ninth Gate (of which this is almost a complete rip-off), but I guess TV budgets don&#39;t always stretch to this kind of acting ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also the thought the direction was confused and dull, serving only to remind me that Carpenter hasn&#39;t done a decent movie since In the Mouth of Madness. As for the story - well, I was disappointed there as well! There was no way it could meet my expectation I guess, but I thought the payoff and explanation was poor, and the way he finally got the film anti-climactic to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was written by one of the main contributors to AICN, and you can tell he does love his cinema, but I would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the DVD back to the store the same day!&#34;,
   &#39;Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliché upon cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the &#34;natural&#34; response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son\&#39;s death. The lawyer has a drunk &#34;friend&#34; and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.&#39;,
   &#34;Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben stiller anymore. How this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me. I can&#39;t understand how this happens if I performed at work the way he acts in a movie I&#39;d get fired and I own the company.....I would have to fire myself. GOD! This movie was just a plain, steaming, stinking pile of POO, that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible. Something else I have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary.&#34;,
   &#39;My wife and I really had high hopes for this film, but it was a major disappointment. It was a Native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails at everything he tries e.g. fishing, hunting, in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies. His &#34;visions&#34; are not only ridiculous but in the process he lies to his son numerous times about various obvious things. Words cannot express how bad this film is. The children and wife are very real which makes the film even sadder. I don\&#39;t get the humor... unless you like laughing at other people making a fool of themselves. I don\&#39;t get how this could have come up for awards. Save your bucks, it\&#39;s not worth the rental.&#39;,
   &#39;Let\&#39;s just say I had to suspend my disbelief less for Spiderman than I did for Hooligans. That is, to say, I have less of a problem believing Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than I do Elija Wood throwing down with toughs in Manchester. I won\&#39;t get into specifics, as I don\&#39;t want to write a spoiler, but the idea of grown, professional, British men getting into near death scraps every weekend is, well... funny. And this film is not. The fighting, the idea of fighting, is taken far too seriously. The gravity of the pugilism, the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating, as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict. It seems as though the plot, with holes big enough to drive a Guiness truck through, has been slapped together with a contrived &#34;fish out of water&#34; theme so that viewers can gaze into Woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie. hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can. The characters are cartoonish, especially the Americans at Harvard. The character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film doesn\&#39;t reach its height until nearly the end, which by then you\&#39;ll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back. Pick up &#34;The Football Factory&#34; or &#34;Fight Club&#34; instead of this corny, and disappointing dud. It doesn\&#39;t waste time with empty melodrama, the tired old &#34;Yankee in King Aurthur\&#39;s Court,&#34; or weepy, parables of coming of age bullsh*t. They\&#39;re just pure, dark, and clever fun; the way violence is supposed to be.&#39;,
   &#34;This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day. A wealthy upper class English woman schemes, plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction. She uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind. There&#39;s a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters. But naturally there&#39;s a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme, but those who thirst for Romance will overlook that.&#34;,
   &#34;`In the tradition of &#39;Carrie&#39; and &#39;Heathers&#39;? Try `a shameless ripoff of not only those two films, but &#39;The Evil Dead&#39; and &#39;The Shining&#39; as well.&#39; That said, they really don&#39;t make bad horror movies like this anymore, and that&#39;s a shame, &#39;cause it&#39;s a gas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rainbow Harvest is the Winona substitute here, and although she barely does more than mumble her lines (and occasionally scream, `YOU&#39;RE UGLY!!!&#39; into her haunted mirror), she&#39;s Goth way before it&#39;s fashionable, so you have to respect her. (And she&#39;s quite creative about it too, accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black-spray-painted Hawaiian-Punch-guy hat. Eat your heart out, Cher.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Black overacts a bit, but she&#39;s not totally without dignity, and you can&#39;t help but sympathize with her. (Unless you&#39;re a certain friend of mine, who asked, `Who is that, Horse Lips from &#39;M.A.S.H&#39;?&#39; the first time she came onscreen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are decent supporting performances by Kristin Dattilo (as the square chick who befriends Rainbow), Ricky Paull Goldin (in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role), and William `Larry, Darryl and Darryl&#39; Sanderson (as some kind of pet undertaker, or something). But it&#39;s sad to see the once smokin&#39; Yvonne DeCarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the Charlotte Rae part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eighties were the heyday for hilarious, mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this, and `Mirror, Mirror&#39; was one of the last of its kind. Definitely worth a look.&#34;,
   &#39;What a sad sight these TV stalwarts make, running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and shabby, and it\&#39;s not helped by a &#34;big name&#34; star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he\&#39;s given in a credible fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At no time do the supporting cast rise above the material; they\&#39;re clearly watching the clock here. Bang out the scenes, get the pay cheque, go home, and try to forget all about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not particularly badly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers, it\&#39;s just utterly anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras. The pacing is a little bizarre; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts, which makes it feel irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maiden Voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored, and for being a fun game of &#34;spot the Kiwi bit parters&#34;; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess. The saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break.&#39;,
   &#34;Live Feed is set in some unnamed Chinese/Japanese Asian district somewhere as five American friends, Sarah (Ashley Schappert), Emily (Taayla Markell), Linda (Caroline Chojnacki), Mike (Lee Tichon) &amp; Darren (Rob Scattergood) are enjoying a night on the town &amp; taking in the sights. After a scuffle in a bar with a Japanese Triad boss (Stephen Chang) they decide to check out a porno theatre, as you would. Inside they are separated &amp; quickly find out that the place belongs to the Triad boss who uses it to torture &amp; kill people for reasons which aren&#39;t made clear. Can local boy Miles (Kevan Ohtsji) save them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Canadian production was co-written, produced &amp; directed by Ryan Nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well, one has to say that Live Feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety &amp; success of Hostel (2005) &amp; the mini craze for &#39;torture porn&#39; as it&#39;s become known. According the IMDb&#39;s &#39;Trivia&#39; section for Live Feed writer &amp; director Nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres, for my money I reckon he wrote it after watching Hostel! The script is pretty poor, there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing &amp; killing people, none. Was it for the Triads? Was it for his pleasure? Was it to make snuff films to sell? Some sort of explanation would have been nice. Also why did he turn on the Triad boss at the end? If your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about Live Feed. It seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex, S&amp;M, horror, torture, gore &amp; action films which doesn&#39;t come off. I mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isn&#39;t automatically going to make your film any good, there still needs to be a decent script &amp; story, right? The character&#39;s were fairly poor clichés &amp; some of their actions &amp; motivations were more than a little bit questionable. It moves along at a reasonable pace, it&#39;s fairly sleazy mixing gore, sex &amp; nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Nicholson doesn&#39;t do anything special here, the editing is choppy &amp; annoying, he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea &amp; the film has a cheap look about it. Available in both &#39;R&#39; &amp; &#39;Unrated&#39; versions I saw the shorter cut &#39;R&#39; version which really isn&#39;t that gory but I am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the &#39;Unrated&#39; version &amp; say that it might be much, much gorier but I can&#39;t say for sure. There&#39;s a fair amount of nudity too if that&#39;s your thing. I wouldn&#39;t say there&#39;s much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isn&#39;t &amp; aren&#39;t respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically Live Feed isn&#39;t terribly impressive, the blood looks a little too watery for my liking &amp; entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening, it to often looks like it was shot on a hand-held camcorder &amp; the choppy editing at least on the &#39;R&#39; rated version is at times an annoying mess. Shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in Vancouver in Canada. The acting is poor, sometimes I couldn&#39;t tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live Feed is not a film I would recommend anyone to rush out &amp; buy or rent, I didn&#39;t think much of it with it&#39;s very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition &amp; which goes nowhere, poor acting &amp; less than impressive gore (at least in the &#39;R&#39; rated cut anyway). Watch either Hostel films again or instead as they are superior.&#34;,
   &#34;In Europe, it&#39;s known as Who Dares Wins; in America, it&#39;s known as The Final Option, but under any title this ludicrous SAS action flick asks the audience to put their disbelief to one side for around two hours. I find it incredibly hard to comprehend how Lewis Collins (the hero here) was almost chosen as Roger Moore&#39;s successor in the Bond films.... this guy is so expressionless he&#39;d struggle to get a job in a waxwork museum (as a waxwork!!!) Luckily, Judy Davis is on hand to partially redeem the affair with a meaty performance as a hard-line lady terrorist, and there&#39;s a climactic ten minute action sequence that is quite competently orchestrated by director Ian Sharp. Let it be added that it&#39;s a very, very, very long wait for these closing excitements to come around, and I can&#39;t honestly say that a near two hour wait for a bit of decent action was worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAS hard man Peter Skellen (Lewis Collins) goes undercover among a group of peace protesters who would like to see the end of nuclear weapons stock-piling. He meets their leader Frankie (Judy Davis), a strong-talking and opinionated woman who might just be capable of taking extraordinary measures to achieve her goals. Frankie&#39;s dedicated bunch violently lay siege to the American Embassy in London, demanding that a nuclear missile be fired at a naval base in Scotland (she believes that when the world witnesses a nuclear blast for real, everyone will be so appalled that they will join her campaign for disarmament). Unfortunately for Frankie, she makes the mistake of taking Skellen on her little embassy raid, and he plans to thwart their plan from inside with a little well-timed outside help from his SAS comrades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is inspired - quite obviously - by the awesome SAS assault on the Iranian Embassy in 1981. Someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to devise a film along similar lines. Unfortunately, the film is rather banal, with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes (the arch-bishop&#39;s debate which descends into a riot, anyone?) Frankie&#39;s idea to bring about peace by instigating a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway, so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain. Who Dares Wins tries to be a celebration of the military legend that is the SAS, but at the same time it dips into clumsy action clichés and ill-thought-out plotting. The result is a well-intentioned but wholly ineffective slice of Boy&#39;s Own absurdity.&#34;,
   &#39;Growing up with the Beast Wars transformers, I wasn\&#39;t very familiar with the original Transformers, and now that I have seen the awesome movie, and now that I have seen the older cartoon on which it\&#39;s based, I have to say I like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than Beast Wars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I don\&#39;t like the BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, &#34;AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!&#34; sounds a lot better than &#34;MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE!&#34; The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me a strong believer that he\&#39;s a real commander, more so than Optimus Primal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, Powermaster Optimus Prime is a lot more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just look on the web! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Megatron in the BW character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides what\&#39;s cooler, robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships? Gimme the original Transformers any day over Beast Wars!&#39;,
   &#39;I suppose it\&#39;s nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this. With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood films, we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions, foul language, and corny one-liners. Minimalism has its place, and can be very effective when employed properly. However, this film is not one of those cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary, sparse scenery. I\&#39;m sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight, because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement. The acting is poor... bland and pedestrian... and features one of the worst crying scenes in history (at the end of the film, if you can sit through it to the end). The scenery is drab, and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled. I would call this anticlimatic, but as the film didn\&#39;t build to any sort of climax whatsoever... not even in the &#34;erotic&#34; scenes... it would be untrue. I\&#39;m sure that there was a script employed during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this film offers nothing to interest or amaze... no great story, no stunning insights, no visual drama, no excitement. Apart from two or three amusing moments, this film is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and dreary film.&#39;,
   &#39;This was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970\&#39;s, usually on the &#34;4am Movie&#34; or one time, on the 7:30 PM &#34;Channel 6 Big Movie&#34; and still another on Creature Double Feature.WHen local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming(mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time) It was of the time. A couple of low-rent Abbott and Costello wannabees(Frankie Ray and Robert Ball) are in a platoon of soldiers(half a dozen guys in Army Surplus remainders) who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation, and wind up encountering extraterrestrials. They first go into Bronson Canyon to what would be later the famous Batcave on BATMAN, and encounter the remains of a dead &#34;carrot monster&#34;. Later, in the cave they\&#39;re chased by a living carrot creature-basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head, with sparkly things on it and ping-pong ball eyes. Two of them-complete geeks,Ray and Ball-are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being &#34;examined&#34; by space amazons-Dr Poona(nooo kidding!) and Professor Tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini &#34;uniforms&#34;. We were too young at the time,to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this &#34;examination&#34; scene would more than suggest. Turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster, are stranded on earth with a ship that\&#39;s well hidden and are trying to return to their world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when Eric Von Zipper and his crew from Frankie and Annette\&#39;s films, were the height of B-film, drive-in comedy.So it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I only thought I\&#39;d imagined seeing this film to start with. No, I really saw it. And when it was released on &#34;restored&#34; DVD I was assured in my memory. The comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid, but whatever.The budget is non-existent, which, is a minor miracle when you think about it, that it even got made and we can talk about a &#34;restored&#34; version here and now-over 40 years later. The payoff is the girls who want to learn about &#34;love&#34; and &#34;kissing&#34; and, the upshot is the geeks-which all of us were- get the girls and love wins out. It\&#39;s just goofy and silly and for the locations, has nostalgic significance.&#39;,
   &#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main question I pose concerning this film is, how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs! merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway, here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball. plot changes abound and the fun is lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIP IT.&#39;,
   &#34;I want to start by stating I am a republican, even though I don&#39;t agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office. And I love the daily show and Colbert report. They have to be two of my favorite shows on TV. I enjoy the bush jokes on Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth(I do believe he&#39;s not the dumbest either.) But it comes to a point when enough is enough and it&#39;s not really that funny anymore. I see where it can be funny and it is(hey he&#39;s making fun of our authority figure he&#39;s hilarious.). Comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him. I mean maybe one special episode, but an entire series is just dumb. It seems CC is just saying the same bush jokes that we&#39;ve heard WAY to many times. I really cannot see this show going past 1 season.&#34;,
   &#34;I like Fulci films, i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn&#39;t really succeed. Structurally, it&#39;s like most Fulci films you&#39;ve seen. Some stuff happens, some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another. Really it&#39;s like Conan with no sets, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was a hard one to get through and i could&#39;ve lived without the inch of vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that Hair Metal music video look.&#34;,
   &#39;I´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by. I expected something better from Uma Thurman, which was the reason I suffered my way through this experience in the first place. An awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality. It´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.&#39;,
   &#34;After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was actually no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don&#39;t cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that&#39;s a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It&#39;s supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I&#39;d expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks he&#39;s a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu&#39;s part was pointless. At the end, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just didn&#39;t work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny. I actually felt sorry about Cruella.&#34;,
   &#39;Title: Robot Jox (1990) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director: Stuart Gordon &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: Stuart Gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, took a small detour here and did a little sci-fi flick. I stress the word &#34;little&#34; since this is a very low budget flick, and there in lies its main weakness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story takes place in the future. A world in which the great superpowers (that according to this movie are the United States and Russia) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war...but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots. Our hero Achilles must go up against the evil Russian robot fighter called Alexander. Lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the idea is awesome I guess. The great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots? Interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available. Unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I as a kid loved this movie, and I guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie, you\&#39;ll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it. I showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like &#34;what the hell is this piece of crap franco?&#34; And I\&#39;m like well this movie is a sci-fi by one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon?&#34; But as the movie progressed into corny territory I almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture. I could go through it, cause I loved this film as a kid, and there\&#39;s still a little nostalgia attached to watching it. But everyone else was just not going to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I myself realized that the movie isn\&#39;t really that good. First off. The movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other. And in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you\&#39;d have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief. But unfortunately this being a small scale movie, from a small scale company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!)the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. Heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK granted, once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other. There are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool, and made me go &#34;thats why I liked thid movie!&#34; But every know and them, some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in. And boom, your right back into realizing this film just doesn\&#39;t live up to its premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie. This movie is basically a movie for kids. You know, giant robots duking it out? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody. So I kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not? After a while I just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really isn\&#39;t a good mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for those of you who don\&#39;t feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don\&#39;t have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like I do) well Id suggest you steer clear away from this one. Gordons a great director, but this movie he made, just didn\&#39;t do it for me. Well, at least not now that I\&#39;m a full grown adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 2 out of 5&#39;,
   &#34;These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom. First, I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that. Then, reaching 70th minute I was convincing myself that it&#39;s only a few more minutes, and I lasted to the very end which I&#39;m kinda proud of as I consider watching this movie as a great test for human&#39;s patience and crap tolerance. Was it worth watching at all? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try and if you&#39;re strong willed enough, you may even last to the end... The movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all. All happenings in the movie, you can be sure you saw somewhere before, and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel.&#34;,
   &#34;This is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie Steven Seagal has ever made. And that says a lot. Don&#39;t get fooled by the rating, it&#39;s way too good. This abomination hadn&#39;t even been worthy of a 0/10 rating, if such a thing existed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Absolutely no plot &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Worst action scenes ever, and there aren&#39;t too many of them either &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Seagal doesn&#39;t do anything himself, including the fighting, talking (lots of dubbing), and so on. As always. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Seagal is fat, lazy and couldn&#39;t care less about this movie. Something which is very obvious all the way through&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take all the other garbage DTV movies Seagal has made, multiply them with each other, multiply this with a thousand billions, and all the badness you then get won&#39;t even describe 1 % of this absolute crapfest.&#34;,
   &#39;Hanna-Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property. The violence is watered down, the stories are formulaic, the animation is bad, the music is obnoxious and repetitive, and frankly, the show just isn\&#39;t funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time, H-B put every one of its series through the same clichéd situations, regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen (&#34;Hey! Popeye is popular, and the Flinstones are popular. Put \&#39;em together, and you can\&#39;t miss!&#34;). Also, in an apparent ripoff of &#34;Private Benjamin,&#34; Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits. Seriously! Why? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode (standard practice at the time for cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I\&#39;m not making that up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, the voice of Popeye from the early days, continues the role here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.&#39;,
   &#39;Where to even start? The horrendous acting? The nonsensical plot? The bargain basement effects? The completely loathsome characters? The choppy editing? The headache-inducing Casio keyboard score??? The embarrassingly racist remarks (&#34;Watch it, Charlie!&#34;, &#34;Back off, Jackie Chan!!&#34;??? The constant misogyny??? I am a lifelong horror fan, and I have no problem at all with the current &#34;torture-thon&#34; trend of movies. However, this is a poorly-made piece of garbage. I think I suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it! If you like girls being forced to eat stir-fried penis, really poor soft core porn and think lines like &#34;I\&#39;m gonna find that b**** and staple her c*** shut!!&#34; are clever, LIVE FEED is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I feel the need to go wash my eyes out with oven cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again!&#39;,
   &#39;My goodness is this movie bad. I was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage. Yeah, yeah, good guys wear white, bad guys wear black....and the good guys always win. Now go home and hug your kids, and feel how good Hollywood has made you feel. Blech! I can\&#39;t believe this brain dead movie was made by Wes Craven. I\&#39;m guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage, so he made this piece of dung. It is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ya see, a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle IL\&#39; bad thing or he\&#39;s gonna hurt her daddy. But being Ms. All-American girl next door, we know she\&#39;s gonna save the day and beat the bad guys...the end. Girl power ROCKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C\&#39;mon now, only an idiot would find this entertaining...&#34;a roller coaster ride,&#34; let alone something fresh or new. All those &#34;super-duper&#34; reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick, paying back a favor, or they have sold their souls to the devil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rachael McAdams is beautiful....yup, that\&#39;s it. Not a good performance, not a horrible one...she\&#39;s just cute. She would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie. She isn\&#39;t tough enough to be a good female action lead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cillian Murphy was at least passable in 28 Days. But here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one. He gets his ass kicked to and fro by the 5\&#39;5\&#39;\&#39; McAdams, because after all, she was a cheerleader...and a field hockey player...and I\&#39;m sure she owns all the Tae Bo tapes...so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire. I wouldn\&#39;t trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ya see, this movie was done before, except before they did it well. Go re-rent any of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are WAY more competent and interesting. I simply don\&#39;t understand how Hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy. No wonder movie revenues are down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw your $6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you\&#39;ll never get back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ciao, FreddyShoop&#39;,
   &#39;No words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the BTK killer. Rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film. From start to finish, there was not one single highlight. The entire thing was horrendously put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-funny, for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together. This review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low-budget film, but this is not the case. Just thinking about the movie I have just seen makes my blood start to boil. How this film was ever granted rights for production i will NEVER know. I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it is truly a stand-out in regards to how pathetic, and disturbingly awful it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film-going, this is the WORST. MOVIE. EVER. I wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand, had I known what I was in for. ZERO out of TEN.&#39;,
   &#39;I got lured by the title... I was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a rowdy Scot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leading character isn\&#39;t given much psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify cheesy teen-like poetry as psychology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a shame, because the core of the story could have been good, with a better effort to depict the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the general idea seems to be more like &#34;I\&#39;m the way I am because that\&#39;s the way I am&#34;. And the laughingly bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lower-class man makes things even worse. Resorting to the overused cliché of the &#34;poète maudit&#34; reeks of a quick fix, a cheap way to make a dull movie seem smart, artsy and meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &#34;16 years of alcohol&#34; isn\&#39;t much smart, artsy or meaningful... The leading character doesn\&#39;t evolve at all, and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation. Just like the initial attempt happened rather out of the blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie borrows heavily from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but it ultimately fails to recapture their greatness, not even for a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story, and neglected the rest, giving us a movie which is pleasant to the eye but insipid to the brain.&#39;,
   &#39;I agree with the majority of the comments I have seen written. I grew up watching Seseme Street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born. I was born in 1964, so I was 5-yrs-old when Seseme Street was introduced to television. The show taught me my numbers (The Count), spelling (the Muppet), and about life. I liked all the old characters (Big Bird, Oscar, Grover, and Cookie Monster) and don\&#39;t quite understand why they had to change. I understand that everything has to change in some way, but to make Cookie Monster into a &#34;veggie monster&#34; to promote healthy eating. The show has introduced new characters and monsters since it\&#39;s inception, why not make a separate &#34;veggie monster&#34; that talks/discusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with Cookie Monster. But, back to my point. I grew up watching the very beginning of Seseme Street, my now 20 yr-old daughter grew up watching SS with me along side her, and we discussed Mr. Hooper dying, although he had died prior to her being born, as well as other topics on the show. I saw the episode as a older child, and still remember how well they portrayed the event, much like real life. And I\&#39;m sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families. You saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events. The show has talked about traditional families, adoptive families and combined families. It\&#39;s one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios. I now have a 5 yr-old daughter who really doesn\&#39;t watch SS. I\&#39;ve tried to watch the show a couple of times, but, it really is not what it used to be. The Elmo 1/2 hr with Mr. Noodle is absolutely ridiculous. Like many people have said, it doesn\&#39;t teach anything. It\&#39;s geared for the less than 18 month old (maybe), and isn\&#39;t even funny. I always prided myself on watching SS as a child, teen, and adult with my own child. Now on my second go-round, I really have a hard time watching SS. The topics that were discussed: death, marriage, non-traditional families, new to neighborhoods, moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 2-99 year old to understand and relate to. Now, there are NO concepts taught, minimal counting, only the occasional mention of the alphabet. It is NOT the same SS, from an original watcher of the show. PLEASE if any producers from the show read these comments, return the show to its foundation. New concepts have never been a problem with SS, they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show.&#39;,
   &#39;It\&#39;s my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson\&#39;s remarkable novel &#34;The Haunting of Hill House&#34; is worth the price of admission even today. Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. I was left shaking my head and asking, why? The acting is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate. I had heard that this update was bad; but couldn\&#39;t believe it was that bad, considering the source material. I was wrong. After watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was, she said; &#34;Well they got your money!&#34; She\&#39;s right, don\&#39;t let them get yours. If there\&#39;s no profit in making lousy re-makes, maybe they\&#39;ll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn\&#39;t insult their audience&#39;,
   &#39;This movie has successfully proved what we all already know, that professional basket-ball players suck at everything besides playing basket-ball. Especially rapping and acting. I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is. First of all, is it just me, or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a can-opener. Secondly, why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when, even though he has magical powers, he sucks horribly at making music? Third, I have read the Bible. In no way shape or form did it say that Jesus made genies. Fourth, what was the deal with all the crappy special effects? I assure you that any acne-addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that. Fifth, why did the ending suck so badly? And what the hell is a djin? And finally, whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the Eiffel Tower, because this movie take the word &#34;suck&#34; to an entirely new level.&#39;,
   &#39;Phew--I don\&#39;t what to say. This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers. Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters\&#39; early offerings. Perhaps I should take that back--I don\&#39;t want to insult Waters\&#39; ability as a director/storyteller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly loved the lawyer taking about the &#34;full faith and credibility&#34; clause. It\&#39;s &#34;full faith and credit,&#34; by the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also reminds me of &#34;The Conrad Boys,&#34; where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc. Those sort of multi-involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability (albeit a stunt, some might say) to pull something off like that.&#39;,
   &#39;Yes, I sat through the whole thing, God knows why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold outside, okay, those are all lame excuses but they\&#39;re the only ones I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen worse films, but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom--poor script, poor acting, bad lighting, and cheesy special effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline, which never completely makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, Daddy, Mommy, and little girl--that I assume the viewer is supposed to be &#34;identifying&#34; with, all three of them were tedious and annoying. You just want the dark side to get every one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars. Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the &#34;mysterious&#34; Orient. Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as &#34;The Darkling&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the course of the film, the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the Devil. So take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy--because trust me, it doesn\&#39;t really matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Darkling\&#39;s main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion--it gets a human companion--and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human who hooks up with The Darkling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long, tedious movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#39;Two old men sitting on a park bench . I don`t really have a problem with this scene - Only problem is that it`s not a scene it`s the entire movie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup movies don`t get anymore low concept than this . They also don`t get anymore boring than this either , but there`s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese . One is Nat Moyer who is Yiddish communist while the other is Midge Carter a former golden gloves champion who`s also black . Let me see now , a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine . Well I guess it`s possible though unlikely , but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the Jewish stereotype ? Why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths ? Slightly ironic that the Jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT is that it`s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema , it`s based on a stage play and it shows . Walter Matthau sleepwalks through his role as Nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie&#39;,
   &#34;This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that&#39;s where it ends. It seemed like a lackluster Set It Off meets The West. The plot barely made any sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There were too may unnecessary things going on that didn&#39;t pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along. There were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense as well as the directing. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you&#39;re only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie is so bad it&#39;s good -- in an unintentionally funny way. I couldn&#39;t stop watching it, I was laughing so much! It&#39;s like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it&#39;s not a parody. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, an oppressed preacher&#39;s wife who falls hard for Luke (Corey Sevier), a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison; the only thing Sevier is guilty of, though, is bad acting! Mind you, he&#39;s no worse than the other actors. You get the sense that the actors have *no* idea they&#39;re in a really awful film; they&#39;re playing it straight. Everything about the film is bad: the acting, the script, the love scenes, the pacing, the plot twists, the choice of music. The climactic scenes are just so ludicrous -- first the shootout in the church, then Luke&#39;s final words to Emily -- I was howling with laughter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidently Luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison, and we get to see plenty of his naked torso. That&#39;s probably the highlight of the film.&#34;,
   &#39;On the 26th of September 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of Leonie Haddad, a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly. Haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had, in fact, come fresh from The Patton State Mental Hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously. Haddad soon realised that something was \&#39;rotten in Denmark\&#39; when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about\&#39; seven Gods\&#39;. Haddad\&#39;s fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that &#34;God has inspired me to kill you&#34;. Haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest. It was a miracle she survived. The lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent, kicking and screaming, back to the laughing academy. Ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity; but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims, but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the \&#39;Queen of the Curve\&#39;s, the \&#39;Tennessee Tease\&#39; and \&#39;Miss Pin Up Girl of the World\&#39; - the Notorious Bettie Page. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director Mary Harron, mainly known for \&#39;American Psycho\&#39; takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model (played solidly enough by Gretchen Mol) who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks. T.N.B.P is day-glo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950\&#39;s where Page, with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers, becomes the number one star of pocket sized men\&#39;s glossies with titles like Wink, Tab and Parade. Her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to God. The overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her father\&#39;s incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her. Mol plays Page as she seems in her photographs, happy, carefree and fun - even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility. The film ends on the upbeat with Page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages, personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her; avoiding what I think is the essential core of Page\&#39;s story - rebirth and resurrection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having emerged from a decade of incarceration Page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980\&#39;s and that she had become a huge underground icon, during which, many were asking &#34;whatever happened to Bettie Page&#34;. Her \&#39;mysterious\&#39; disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend. When the world\&#39;s media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines, T.V and being photographed at Playboy parties with the likes of Pamela Anderson and the equally tragic Anna Nicole Smith. She found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her \&#39;glory years\&#39; but in the glare of this \&#39;resurrection\&#39; it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only notorious thing about The Notorious Bettie Page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;d completely forgotten about this film until now. This was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that I have ever seen. It\&#39;s message seemed to be : &#34;Don\&#39;t teenagers use their imagination; they might take games seriously, go mad and hurt people.&#34; I can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that D&amp;D style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship.&#39;,
   &#34;Very businesslike authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his/her name clean - check. A veteran cop that has bad relationship with his family - check. Mafia guys that while criminals, want to do something good vigilante style - check. A sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example - check. Cops&#39; methods being less effective than the mafia guy&#39;s brutal yet very effective methods - check. A corrupt cop tying the authority, the criminals and the police together - check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slow motion and/or jerky frame rates for showing what the actor&#39;s reaction can&#39;t - check. A serial killer whose background is explained in far too much detail, esp. using childhood abuse as the reason for everything - check. A child spree killer that is very, very non-menacing - check. Foreshadowing of the veteran cop&#39;s moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie&#39;s and the majority of characters&#39; opinion - check. Morally ambiguous and predictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the good veteran cop&#39;s coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters - check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently saw this on TV and decided to endure it because it had Dennis Hopper in it and I could not sleep - check. Realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling - check.&#34;,
   &#39;I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this movie a look. Disappointed. On the plus side the male leads are good, and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince. Seems to be full of its\&#39; own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;A film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, menace and cynical characters&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well that is the story here: 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers. I thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst some good moments, I finished up feeling I had wasted my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie is just not worth your time. Its reliance upon New-Age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction. The plot is one that has been re-cycled countless times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when I noted that some have tried to prop-up the reputation of this drivel. Their motivation &amp; objectivity is dubious, since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults, but at its well intentioned message of New Age consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would it be alright for some twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians, or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies/television that support their views? In spite of the poor qualities of production, or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis? I hope not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie, in spite of the truth.&#39;,
   &#34;Can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After helming the appalling &#39;House of the Dead&#39; director Uwe Boll has now cast his less-than-talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. Don&#39;t these guys get it? To anyone who can&#39;t understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! The acting here is, at best, sub-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which did have its scary moments) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored. Why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets. Avoid at all costs.&#34;,
   &#34;The only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining. I would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again. Even for a TV movie it is flat. The cast is boring. The screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand. How two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th Century. There is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the Omen franchise, and it is shot in slo-mo and cut short at the anticipated pay-off. If you are tempted to see this, pop it in, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfy. With any luck you&#39;ll doze off quickly, and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over. Namely, this movie.&#34;,
   &#34;OK, so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pity the fools who still think so... Its absolute rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is just ... ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise, im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn&#39;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean and others, are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this film, and well, maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could&#39;ve. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film. Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy... its pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the film... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may&#39;ve been good for its time, but, really, its drivel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must&#39;ve just been hype about Dean&#39;s death that has over-inflated the reputation of this film.&#34;,
   &#39;As others have said, &#34;No, Luciano&#34; is a more apt title or response to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should stick to singing.....not that he\&#39;s a terrible actor. It\&#39;s just that this movie stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie, as it were - but after that it\&#39;s nothing but a boring soap opera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appropriately playing a singer, Pavarotti, as &#34;Giorgio Fini,&#34; loses his voice a few times and the doctor, &#34;Pamela Taylor&#34; (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls for the doctor, the doctor slowly falls for the singer, the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy. It\&#39;s Harrold that spoils things and after watching her here I am not surprised she didn\&#39;t become a star. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy, good shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I got bored and don\&#39;t remember much about the second half of it.&#39;,
   &#34;foywonder&#39;s review of this cheap STV hits the nail squarely on the head. Make sure you read it. In case you don&#39;t, a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest, to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. The Big Foot family doesn&#39;t take kindly to this, and proceeds to pick off the team one by one, largely offscreen. Big Foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face, but is less scary overall than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the movie has the wooden, generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away. This is a no-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on screen. We do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches, but nothing comes of this.&#34;,
   &#39;Acting was weak, but in a horror flick, I can live with that if the story is good. It wasn\&#39;t. The initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people\&#39;s adoration of kids. OK, fine. Fast forward to the &#34;place in the country&#34; where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of the ghosts. OK, cool--this will be a supernatural kinda horror story, with rotting things partly in our world partly in...where ever. Then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds--Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? Is there an evil force trying to attack them INdirectly--make people do awful things they wouldn\&#39;t really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder? OK, hold on--maybe it\&#39;s really just one little mentally tangled &#34;Delbert&#34;-style redneck boy who misses his Mommy and is on some kind of spree like a K-Tel Norman Bates knock off? Oh, yeah--extra points off: the only Black character seems to be the grandson of an &#34;Our Gang&#34; pullman porter. The actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue, but the fact is, his purpose is &#34;Y\&#39;all done betta get outa heah, Boss!&#34; At least they wrote him smart enough to GTF outta there. The bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy, as was the chick in the shower. Those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, like a bite of steak, a bite of chocolate and a bite of a Gummi bear. Each is great on it\&#39;s own, but mixed up? Bleah! Such potential. Wasted.&#39;,
   &#39;not to long after Jeff Jarrett left the WWF for good he spoke of that night . Owen Hart and him where good friends and both 2nd generation wrestlers. Jeff first remarks &#34;I was literally pushed thru the curtain as my lifeless friends body was wheeled past me &#34; . Debra McMichael( Steve Austin\&#39;s Ex wife as well as Steve Mondo McMichael Ex wife&#34;.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Owen Hart Fell, a video promo the ring was darkened, as a Blue Blazer (owen Hart Promo was played. The fall and video of owen in the ring was never showed on TV. There are a few news photos that got posted. When they came back from the video promo Jim ross was talking over a all we had was a crowd shot \\., He stated that Owen Hart as The blue blazer has fallen and doesn\&#39;t look good. Lawler then came back from the ring his face was ashen he told Jim that the situation was very critical paramedics where working hard to revive him. Rock And HHH where going there match in a private room when another Referee came in and told them Owen fell at first,knowing Owen Harts constantly being a prankster they thought it wasn\&#39;t real. But both later stated that the look of the referee face said it all. In fact as he fell ,as mentioned in other post , he yelled for the referee and ring announcer to move. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brother Bret hart was a plane heading to LA to do a angle on the Tonight Show , he couldn\&#39;t get any of the plane phones to work, One of the captains got a message to call home something had happened. When he landed in La Eric bishoff was there told him what had happened, and put him on a charter flight to Kansas City to the morgue, Bret even later with Owens widow Martha went up to the top of the arena where Owen was standing. Police found no foul play formerly closed as a accident .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the Information in Bret Harts book as well as the book by Martha Hart ,&#39;,
   &#34;Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi &amp; Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as to why this film is so bad, where do I begin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didn&#39;t even have the guts to call it by it&#39;s full name &#39;The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz&#39; on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how low he can go.&#34;,
   &#34;This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen, (yes it&#39;s even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any film starring Kevin Costner.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film, and his supporting actors didn&#39;t even look like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can&#39;t transfer his talent to this film, which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#39;t watched this film yet, avoid it like the plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Chris&#39; efforts I give it a 2/10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;There\&#39;s nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s only my opinion, but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable, intelligent characters. As far as likability is concerned, the protagonists in Say Yes are a quaint married couple. Nicely done. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. Let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him what hotel you\&#39;re staying at when you drop him off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thereby allowing him to press charges of assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Don\&#39;t bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume (for no apparently good reason) that the cops were bribed by him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. While trying to escape, let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. After getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one-on-one. No point in being unfair, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I\&#39;d never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it\&#39;s effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety, since they are victims of their own doing. This kills the enjoyability of the entire film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you were wondering, the scriptwriters didn\&#39;t stop with dim-witted characters. Since they themselves are surely dim-witted for writing this crapfest, they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The stalker kills a cop inside a police station \x96 while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people, yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The &#34;suspense&#34; scenes had no imagination whatsoever. In fact, some scenes were direct rip-offs from American movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive is the decapitation near the end, which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife. It\&#39;s too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly, the Koreans behind the making of Say Yes should be ashamed of themselves. Better yet, they should just move to California and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence.&#39;,
   &#34;I watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children.. The terror on this mother&#39;s face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. And the sad thing is--internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains. All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has. I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed. I&#39;m surprised this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This also was a route for the poor from the mountains.&#34;,
   &#34;I found this film to be an utter dissapointment. The talent available to the director- notably Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main leads)- have been completely wasted on an unfunny, mediocre story, whose conclusion one couldn&#39;t really care about once introduced to the dire, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is feeble, Zeta-Jones is just plain annoying (appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour), Crystal just plays his same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and Cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what is supposed to be a &#39;Romantic comedy&#39;, there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for the comedy- (possible SPOILERS)well, the only moments of mild humour came off the back of Cusack&#39;s role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably amusing as the Mexican lover and Walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-Dogme type director- but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead (Spoilers) we were treated to Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. Pure genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a huge fan of the majority of John Cusack&#39;s work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas, and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them, instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost &#39;gross-out, teen-movie&#39; humour at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very poor 4/10.&#34;,
   &#34;There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And WHY DO THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS BAD??? The premise is absurd. Thre acting is one dimensional. The special effects are overdone. And the movie is one unending gun battle among some of the lousiest shots Hollywood ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everybody would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad it didn&#39;t happen that way. Tempted to turn it off several times, I stuck with it to see just how bad it could get. Glad I did because (SPOILER?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, dismal scenario.It is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive-in in off season. Apart from the general awfulness of the film, I worry deeply about its impact on young audiences. The Americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is truly banal cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!&#34;,
   &#39;[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Timon and Pumbaa are watching The Lion King. Timon decides to go back BEFORE the beginning, to when the story really began. So they go back. Way back. Back even before Simba was born. Back to Timon\&#39;s old home which was miles away from Pride Rock. A clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. The worst digger in the clan was a pompous, self-centered meerkat named Timon. His mother took pity on him but Uncle Max just shook his head. Mother suggested putting Timon on sentry duty; Timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. Just then, hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed arrived and nearly killed poor Uncle Max. That did it. The other meerkats just wanted Timon to go away while Timon took it upon himself to leave. So he kissed his mom goodbye and started off. He didn\&#39;t get very far before he started getting homesick. Just then he met Rafiki, who taught him to look beyond what he sees. Timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named Pumbaa, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. Timon and Pumbaa join up then, but Timon declared them acquaintances, rather than friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They soon arrive at Pride Rock where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeests, rhinoceroses, giraffe\&#39;s, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. What was going on? Timon didn\&#39;t care. They pressed on. Timon then saw Rafiki atop Pride Rock lifting into the air something he couldn\&#39;t see. Just then all the animals took a bow. Was this to honor the birth of the new king? No, Pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses; Timon and Pumbaa try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests! Pumbaa and Timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream. When they reach land, Timon decides to give up. But then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. It was beautiful: trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. Timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from Rafiki: Hakuna Matata. Timon and Pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into Simba. They take him under their wing and become father figures. They teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. Pretty soon, a teenage Simba takes on Timon in a snail slurping contest. Simba won, leaving Timon deathly ill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then one day, Simba\&#39;s childhood friend Nala arrived. Timon and Pumbaa just knew she\&#39;d break up the friendship. Suddenly, Simba runs away. Nala and Pumbaa race after him, but not Timon. He chose to stay at &#34;Hakuna Matata&#34; by himself, until Rafiki &#34;talked&#34; some sense into him, so he joins his friends at Pride Rock. Timon\&#39;s mother and Uncle Max arrive then. While Simba battles Scar, Mother and Max dig a large hole to trap hyenas Shenzi, Bonzai and Ed in. It worked. Scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas. Then all is well. Mother, Uncle Max and the rest of the meerkats go live with Timon and Pumbaa in the paradise that is Hakuna Matata. Back to the present, Timon and Pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly Mother, Uncle Max, Simba and Rafiki want to watch it again. So do Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Snow White, the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo, Peter Pan, the Lost Boys, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Genie, Aladdin, and Jasmine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, I must say that The Lion King 1 1/2 wasn\&#39;t as good as I had hoped. It was too ridiculous and silly. The original Lion King was a masterpiece. It had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. This one was just silly and made a mockery of it. I swear, sometimes Timon and Pumbaa are just way too overplayed. They\&#39;re overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. The original voice cast is back: Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, Matthew Broddrick as Adult Simba, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, Cheech Marin as Bonzai, Jim Cummings as Ed, Robert Guillame as Rafiki. New to the cast are Julie Kavner of TV\&#39;s (Too) long running series The Simpsons as Timon\&#39;s mom and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max. So anyway, this movie isn\&#39;t The Lion King III, and it isn\&#39;t II because there already is a II. It takes place right after Part I and Part II is a ways away. Hence, it\&#39;s 1 1/2. In conclusion, I don\&#39;t recommend this to die hard Lion King fans because it\&#39;s far too ridiculous and frivilous. However the kids will love it so I recommend it to them. I hope this will also be the LAST Lion King movie. Two is enough. &#34;The Lion King 1 1/2&#34;. What we\&#39;ve come to expect from Disney sequel makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&#39;,
   &#39;The plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify AS &#34;plot&#34; and &#34;character&#34;. The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out-of-focus, and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn\&#39;t help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are pretty entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. Though he does show his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b*****d who\&#39;s just minding his own business!Images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from Fulci. Maybe it ruined his career, but it wasn\&#39;t really much more stupid than Zombie. Worth a rental if you like gory Italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?&#39;,
   &#34;I rented this film to see what might be a bloody, non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks, he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard, I swear! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back. There is no good fight scenes at all, the punches are two inches away from a person. Characters personalities change in matter of seconds. One guy is a bad and in the next scene he&#39;s good. The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick. I hated this film.&#34;,
   &#34;Just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He&#39;s reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn&#39;t changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago. He&#39;s doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. He&#39;s some weird Type A comedian, not the cool cat he&#39;s supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (Cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) Alec Balwin tries to do a funny Great Santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. There&#39;s even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs, folks. It&#39;s not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they&#39;ll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams. Then we&#39;ll have the bad-Seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy.)&#34;,
   &#39;Well, on the endless quest for horror, we will come across this film, apparently re-released on DVD recently for some ungodly reason. The transfer is awful and the quality just sucks. I don\&#39;t think this is due to a bad remaster or anything, I just think the film is poorly done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks, &#34;Slaughter High&#34; starts out slow and doesn\&#39;t pick up pace until about an hour in. First, we get to see a \&#39;nerd\&#39; as he is picked on by a group of...I actually don\&#39;t even know what they were supposed to be...jocks? The ringleader, with his ultra hooknose is so ugly he should have definitely been cast as the nerd. Then, there is a \&#39;big guy\&#39; and a couple of dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be \&#39;hot\&#39; but aren\&#39;t. It\&#39;s a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own, but I guess the viewer is to assume these are \&#39;cool kids\&#39; picking on a dweeb. The casting choices are horrendous as most of the high schoolers are played by thirty-somethings. As other reviewers on here have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that,) are a bunch of Brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap. We are left to assume that this group of \&#39;children\&#39; were the only students at this school, as their \&#39;reunion\&#39; is only them at the school, which is now shown to be abandoned, is just them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kills are lame, the gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: \&#39;This place gives me the creeps...\&#39; and \&#39;Someone gimme a beer\&#39; are highlights...It\&#39;s just not good. Skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher. If you wanna see good, get Bava\&#39;s &#34;Bay Of Blood,&#34; done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better. If you wanna see a good BAD slasher, see &#34;Just Before Dawn&#34; or &#34;The Burning.&#34; 2 out of 10, kids.&#39;,
   &#39;After watching this movie I was honestly disappointed - not because of the actors, story or directing - I was disappointed by this film advertisements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trailers were suggesting that the battalion &#34;have chosen the third way out&#34; other than surrender or die (Polish infos were even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by own artillery or German guns, they even translated the title wrong as &#34;misplaced battalion&#34;). This have tickled the right spot and I bought the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disappointment started when I realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies... Then I began to think &#34;hey, this story can\&#39;t be that simple... I bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops&#34;. Well, he didn\&#39;t, they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen. And so was I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was based on real events of World War I, so the writers couldn\&#39;t make much use of their imagination, but even thought I found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring. And as I wrote in the first place - it isn\&#39;t fault of actors, writers or director - their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with.&#39;,
   &#39;I want so badly to give this piece of GARBAGE a zero, unfortunately, there isn\&#39;t, so, I had to give it a 1 just to warn you about how stupidly terrible this imposter of a familiar cartoon really is! The characters look like they were drawn by pre-schoolers, no, wait, I\&#39;ve seen pre-schoolers do better! I prefer &#34;Misadventures of Flapjack&#34; to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I\&#39;m probably saying what others have said, two words: RIP OFF!! Remember that episode of Dexter\&#39;s Lab when they raced go-karts down that volcano? yeah, Mister Fellows even cashed in on that idea and failed! They even ripped off Shadow Lugia in that one episode that parodied Pokemon!(he even cashed in on that franchise!) That one character is a cheap rip off of Mandark from Dexter\&#39;s Lab! Mister Fellows needs to be sued for statutory infringement for this piece of crap!! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test, your\&#39;e just lying to yourselves. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen!&#39;,
   &#34;I downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the Quality was kinda good! I was watching the movie with high expectations (though i knew it was a flop), especially as the film has superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain.I though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles.But unfortunately Mr Bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete AMJAD KHAN&#39;s magic Rgv&#39;s trial to re-kindle the past backfired royally! Sholay, the old one is a milestone in Indian cinema with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too.A good actor like Ajay Devgan&#39;s TALENTS ARE wasted and his performance was average.Prashant Raj, a newcomer doesn&#39;t know what acting is . Nisha Kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have I don&#39;t know how she is still in RGV&#39;s crew Urmila &amp; Abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion Mohanlal tried his best and Susmitha Sen&#39;s work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie It was a Total carnage of the original Sholay&#34;,
   &#39;Now that Che(2008) has finished its relatively short Australian cinema run (extremely limited release:1 screen in Sydney, after 6wks), I can guiltlessly join both hosts of &#34;At The Movies&#34; in taking Steven Soderbergh to task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style/subject, but Soderbergh\&#39;s most recent stinker, The Girlfriend Experience(2009), was also missing a story, so narrative (and editing?) seem to suddenly be Soderbergh\&#39;s main challenge. Strange, after 20-odd years in the business. He was probably never much good at narrative, just hid it well inside &#34;edgy&#34; projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this excuses him this present, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, &#34;two parts of Che don\&#39;t (even) make a whole&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epic biopic in name only, Che(2008) barely qualifies as a feature film! It certainly has no legs, inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history, Soderbergh\&#39;s 4.5hrs-long dirge just goes nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving of Australia\&#39;s At The Movies duo, noted about Soderbergh\&#39;s repetitious waste of (HD digital storage): &#34;you\&#39;re in the woods...you\&#39;re in the woods...you\&#39;re in the woods...&#34;. I too am surprised Soderbergh didn\&#39;t give us another 2.5hrs of THAT somewhere between his existing two Parts, because he still left out massive chunks of Che\&#39;s &#34;revolutionary&#34; life! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure, Soderbergh unaccountably alienates, if not deliberately insults, his audiences by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. never providing most of Che\&#39;s story; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. barely developing an idea, or a character; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. remaining claustrophobically episodic; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. ignoring proper context for scenes---whatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. linguistically dislocating all audiences (even Spanish-speakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in English); and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension. Why, at THIS late stage? The T-shirt franchise has been a success! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen basing their screenplay solely on Guevara\&#39;s memoirs. So, like a poor student who has read only ONE of his allotted texts for his assignment, Soderbergh\&#39;s product is exceedingly limited in perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge, scenery and circumstances of the &#34;revolutionaries&#34;, but that doesn\&#39;t elicit our sympathy. Instead, it dawns on us that &#34;Ah, Soderbergh\&#39;s trying to hobble his audiences the same as the Latino peasants were at the time&#34;. But these are the SAME illiterate Latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them, and keep us equally mentally captive? Such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part2 is more chronological than Part1, but it\&#39;s literally mind-numbing with its repetitive bush-bashing, misery of outlook, and lack of variety or character arcs. DelToro\&#39;s Che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own ill-disciplined troops. The only letup is the humour as Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant &#34;revolutionaries&#34;, some of whom violently lack self-control around local peasants or food. We certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions, nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency, such as it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part2\&#39;s excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic: again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. Thus even the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demián Bichir) are unexpected and disconcerting. Any selected events are portrayed minimally and Latino-centrically, with Part1\&#39;s interviews replaced by time-shifting meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) and US Government officials promising CIA intervention(!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of Part2\&#39;s &#34;woods&#34; and day-for-night blue filter just exasperate the audience until they\&#39;re eyeing the exits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps DelToro felt too keenly the frustration of many non-American Latinos about never getting a truthful, unspun history of Che\&#39;s exploits within their own countries. When foreign governments still won\&#39;t deliver a free press to their people--for whatever reason--then one can see how a popular American indie producer might set out to entice the not-so-well-read (&#34;I may not be able to read or write, but I\&#39;m NOT illiterate!&#34;--cf.The Inspector General(1949)) out to their own local cinemas. The film\&#39;s obvious neglects and gross over-simplifications hint very strongly that it\&#39;s aiming only at the comprehensions of the less-informed WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE English. If they did, they\&#39;d have read tomes on the subject already, and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselves--learning the lessons of history as they should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such insights are precisely what societies still need--and not just the remaining illiterate Latinos of Central and South America--yet it\&#39;s what Che(2008) gleefully fails to deliver. Soderbergh buries his lead because he\&#39;s weak on narrative. I am gobsmacked why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew this. It\&#39;s been 44yrs, hindsight about Guevara was sorely wanted: it\&#39;s what I went to see this film for, but the director diabolically robs us of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Stratton, writing in The Australian (03-Oct-2009) observed that while Part1 was &#34;uneven&#34;, Part2 actually &#34;goes rapidly downhill&#34; from there, &#34;charting Che\&#39;s final campaign in Bolivia in excruciating detail&#34;, which &#34;...feels almost unbearably slow and turgid&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Che:The Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly no travelogue for Bolivia, painting it a picture of misery and atavism. The entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour, and the dramatic--yet tragic--capture and execution of the film\&#39;s subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing, irritating misery--shockingly, for a Soderbergh film, to be avoided at all costs. It is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject.(2/10)&#39;,
   &#34;I have been learning about the Zodiac for four years now. And I&#39;m not saying I know much more than anyone else...in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about Z, I am prolly the one with the least knowledge...But I do know or at least I think I know that most of the stuff in this wouldn&#39;t happen...From how he signed his name...to how he killed people...I thought that Godfather was the worst film ever...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography was that of a five year old...not saying that my films are any better but I am not someone who is making movies for the mass population...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting I thought for the most part was pretty good really I did...the lead didn&#39;t talk that much on camera or at all I forget and don&#39;t know because I stopped watching...his voice overs where good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else...like a large pizza or something...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I learn how to write a review, Psycho Phil&#34;,
   &#34;If Mr Cranky had rated this, I&#39;d be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here. But as he hasn&#39;t, I&#39;ll have to give it a go myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall&#39;s acting is excellent. However not even he can save this film from disaster. The director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad &#39;70&#39;s movies. Even worse, both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the Proxate Corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container/slave ship to Nigeria. This ship&#39;s computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via USB 12 or something. The company should have been called the Prostate Corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#39;t find one scene that I could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie. I only watched it to the end as I had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular. I won&#39;t hold this against him as he&#39;s a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you&#39;re male and you&#39;re doctor isn&#39;t doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you&#39;re really community minded, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster.&#34;,
   &#39;First, let me just comment on what I liked about the movie. The special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There, that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact, I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I can\&#39;t even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the &#34;plot twist&#34; (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where Lois\&#39;s 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of Superman. When the crying super-child throws a piano at Lex\&#39;s henchman to save his mother, I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child. It\&#39;s been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It doesn\&#39;t take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what\&#39;s wrong with that. I don\&#39;t know how many comic books Brian Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Superman-related projects ever again. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. That\&#39;s not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a God-like Jor-el sent to Earth to be a savior. Jor-el wasn\&#39;t all-wise, he was just a scientist. And he didn\&#39;t send his son to earth to be a savior, he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. I\&#39;ll buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode, and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christ\&#39;s primary weakness. Furthermore, the &#34;crucifixion&#34; scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite &#34;spear&#34; just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until I\&#39;m too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. They might as well rename this movie &#34;Superman Returns: the Passion of the Christ.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of Luthor, my last major complaint has to do with Singer\&#39;s depiction of Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is a shrewd, cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President (which he does in the comics) than try to destroy the world. The man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge, not wreck everything. Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns, as well as all the previous Superman movies, is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the (quite awful) previous Superman movies, this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. Maybe Singer\&#39;s next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show. ZAM! WHAP! POW!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, I don\&#39;t know what I hate more, the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don\&#39;t hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven\&#39;t already. Don\&#39;t see it, don\&#39;t buy it when it comes out on DVD, don\&#39;t rent it...basically don\&#39;t contribute any money towards it in any way. This movie does not deserve to make any money. In fact, I think that for every person that sees this movie, Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. If you\&#39;re a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie, just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you\&#39;ll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time.&#39;,
   &#39;Oh dear me! Rarely has a &#34;horror&#34; film bored me, or made me laugh, as much as this one. After a spirited start with an intriguing premise, it descends into not much more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual asides. The usually excellent Alice Krige is wasted in this one, and the plot twists are ludicrous. Don\&#39;t bother unless you\&#39;re really desperate. Rating: 3/10.&#39;,
   &#34;This one is bad. A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it. A series of crimes, the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie, the classic investigations. And also the classic tale about a cop who figures out what&#39;s going on and isn&#39;t believed by anyone, so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth. Not too much in this one. Vote: 4 out of 10.&#34;,
   &#34;When they killed off John Amos&#39;s character they killed the show. He was the vital part of the info structure. You had a story of an inner city family&#39;s struggling to make it the best way they knew how. They were poor, they were black, and they were living proof that if you have Jesus and your family that nothing is too hard. Sure James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children. Florida was the strong lady that would everyone including James when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it. The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit. Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family. Things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. James dies and JJ took over the show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flo was still mom, Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show. We were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment. I guess James&#39;s paycheck didn&#39;t do much for the family. They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working. I know that JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real. James worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren&#39;t realistic at all and that&#39;s a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JJ was the comic relief but I felt the show need substance. It&#39;s OK to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs. Michael&#39;s character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evan&#39;s show. I mean really, here was a guy that was failing in school, he kept getting laid off, and he painted for money in about two episodes. James had always been there to encourage his talent but Flo and the rest of the family didn&#39;t seem to care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do? He could have sold painting&#39;s on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards. (He did but something went wrong with that.) Why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams? I&#39;ll tell you why, it was because they didn&#39;t have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams. The show stopped teaching us about growing, building and learning and started teaching us about gimmicks and catch phrases. They should have kept James. If any show needed a father it was that one.&#34;,
   &#39;The only reason &#34;The Norliss Tapes&#34; deserves ANY stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Other than getting to see Angie Baby in a pre-&#34;Police Woman&#34; performance, there\&#39;s nothing else worth seeing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SYNOPSIS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** MINOR SPOILERS ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural. One day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the &#34;Norliss tapes&#34; -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient Egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover the ring itself doesn\&#39;t grant immortality. Instead, it only reanimates the sculptor\&#39;s corpse, allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out ARRRGHHHHHHs you haven\&#39;t heard since you last watched &#34;Scooby Doo&#34; cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) one dark night. She escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts Norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband\&#39;s uncanny reappearance on her estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is this guy a vampire? No. There\&#39;s no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard. The sculptor doesn\&#39;t drink his victims\&#39; blood -- he collects it. How? Don\&#39;t know. We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality. It turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it\&#39;s finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as his gateway into our world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE FINAL ANALYSIS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Norliss Tapes&#34; wasn\&#39;t picked up as a series for a very good reason... it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, ill-conceived mess. The acting and dialogue offer no better. This isn\&#39;t even a contender for a &#34;So Bad It\&#39;s Good&#34; Award. Sometimes bad is just bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of &#34;The Norliss Tapes,&#34; I was very excited to find it airing on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I hadn\&#39;t set myself up for the fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only assume any applause you\&#39;ve heard so far from other IMDB reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of Dan Curtis. Either way, they\&#39;ve offered you misleading reviews of &#34;The Norliss Tapes.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pauly Orchid -- October 17, 2003&#39;,
   &#39;this movie is made for Asian/Chinese market, targeting particularly fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest music star in Asian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay Chou is a very talented song writer/singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he did appear in several big-budget productions (&#34;initial D&#34;, &#34;Curse of the Golden Flower &#34;). Amazingly, he won both golden horse (taiwan) and Hong Kong film awards for &#34;initial D&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast are very well chosen, which appeals basically everyone from China. The cast including many famous movie/TV actors, singers, even sport commentator (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest mistake is that Chu took over both director and writer position. He has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non-coherent scripts. With his poor directing and lam story, the whole talented cast, fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the terrible movie successfully cashed in over 10 million dollars, maybe even more in Asian, which made this one of the biggest box office success in Asian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is: you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted, or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of Jay Chou.&#39;,
   &#34;I don&#39;t what that other review was talking about. This definitely isn&#39;t a bimbo movie, in fact, I don&#39;t think there was one decent looking girl in it. No, it&#39;s just cheesy, poorly-done, Ed Wood-style science fiction schlock. And it&#39;s bad. I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how bad it is. I saw it late at night on cable, and I was in shock. The fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all. The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke, and the pace is insanely slow. To me though, the music tops it all. A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on cable, watch it. You&#39;ll be amazed at how bad a movie can be.&#34;,
   &#39;This is 30 minute show about one joke. The joke, Cavemen are not treated fairly. HaHaHa!!! He can\&#39;t dial a phone because he is a Caveman. Cavemen are not as smart as human beings. Oh jeez, those Cavemen are so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this show. They can only run off this one joke for so long and they already have with the Geico commercials. This show does not deserve a time slot on national T.V. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This show tries to hard to be funny, but it just isn\&#39;t. Watching this show, I was thinking that it was trying to be like a &#34;Bachelor\&#39;s Gone Wild Show.&#34; Meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The crying caveman is annoying. The caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman(HAHAHA!!!). All three of them have personalities, but I can\&#39;t figure out why I don\&#39;t care about them.&#39;,
   &#34;I got the DVD very cheap and I&#39;m a total Drewbie, and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An early Drew movie, she&#39;s looking great, and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, quite a number of sexy outfits etc. She does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie itself is pretty average or sub-average, and much more looking like being made for the TV than one for the cinema. There is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly don&#39;t understand it. But maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway. But at least you don&#39;t get the end you would be expecting, and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.&#34;,
   &#34;The humor in Who&#39;s Your Daddy is such poor taste that I actually closed my eyes in certain scenes. Close ups of semen are not funny! Nobody thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so gross and to hide their nervousness, they laugh. Watching Who&#39;s Your Daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling.&#34;,
   &#34;I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn&#39;t have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark&#39;s worst film There is so much wrong with this film. First off, some of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as &#39;The Bully&#39;, and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can&#39;t recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He&#39;s a veteran of Clark&#39;s films now and he was so brilliant in &#39;Kids&#39;, but in &#39;Bully&#39; he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn&#39;t fathom Clark&#39;s intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids&#39; existence? It sure as hell didn&#39;t stop him getting in a damn good perv. I&#39;m no prude but I didn&#39;t need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark&#39;s best film is &#39;Another Day in Paradise&#39;. It&#39;s fantastic and I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll ever top it.&#34;,
   &#34;A fun concept, but poorly executed. Except for the fairly good makeup effects, there&#39;s really not much to it. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days... and once he&#39;s deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, the movie has far worse problems than that--the cinematography is decidedly low-budget-TV-show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around. Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I&#39;m giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and Joe Mantegna&#39;s character takes over, the movie develops a fun, campy &#39;cheesefest slaughterhouse&#39; feel, and the gangster&#39;s crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch. The ending, if predictable, is also nicely mean. Avoid unless you&#39;re a King-o-Phile or are REALLY psyched up at the idea of the voice of Fat Tony from the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp.&#34;,
   &#34;THE TOY BOX (1971) BOMB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I like looking at nude women. While I prefer hardcore porn flicks, I&#39;ll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances. Well, these aren&#39;t the right circumstances. These aren&#39;t ANY circumstances. There&#39;s supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere, but I&#39;ll be damned if I can untangle it. This is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you, despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place. Bah -- if I want to see good sex scenes, I&#39;ll watch the real stuff.&#34;,
   &#39;(Spoilers galore) This is an absolutely awful film. First of all it has that guy from medium. I guess he\&#39;s made a career out of playing super doting dads. It was OK the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster...but then 10 minutes later they cloyingly did it again! And so it goes, this film moves in excruciating real time. At one point, I started imaging it was days later, until I was reminded that the story line was only at the next day...in the early afternoon still! I\&#39;m not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life. First of all they are presented as sort of a Manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a kid. But they drive an old blue Volvo. Those types stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today they drive Priuses. But in 2002, I\&#39;m sure they still weren\&#39;t driving Volvos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, then there\&#39;s Wendigo. A &#34;mysterious Indian man&#34; gives the boy a little magic Wendigo statue and tells him of its powerful magic. C\&#39;mon...are we still doing ancient Indian mysteries. Just to drive it home, they pan across every Indian statue in their tourist trap upstate New York town. American Indians are portrayed in a manner not seen for decades in this film! Oh, and about Wendigo. He is not actually the cause of the horror. He doesn\&#39;t kill the kid\&#39;s dad which is the most horrible thing in the film...he\&#39;s just killed by an ordinary hick with a grudge and a high powered rifle. The Wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the guy who killed the dad...oh, but wait, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was kind of mad at the dad, maybe because he killed a deer...so then Wendigo must have been happy that the dad was killed...but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so it goes...insulting, boring and nonsensical. There is no reason to watch this film at all.&#39;,
   &#39;You know all those letters to &#34;Father Christmas&#34; and &#34;Jesus&#34; that are sent every year? Well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. As bizarre settings go, it\&#39;s a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is &#34;Dead Letter Office&#34;. Having said that, this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one. If it was Royal Mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. I haven\&#39;t been in this flat for two years and we\&#39;re still getting letters for a Mr Wang, some female priest of the Church of Latter Day I\&#39;ve-Never-Heard-Of-You and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Dead Letter Office&#34; (the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up) follows the story of Alice (Miranda Otto) who grows up in a seriously divided home. Writing to her absent father, she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven\&#39;t been delivered for one reason or another. So, logically, she gets a job at the D.L.O. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant Frank Lopez (George Del Hoyo). Slowly, she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the god-awful Heather Graham film &#34;Committed&#34; while watching this. However, this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again, that ain\&#39;t difficult. For a start, this film is much more logical. True, the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood. But at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel. It is also well acted. Both Otto and Del Hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they\&#39;ll never find while other characters are peripheral at best. Part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly, leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed. The other part is that when you consider Australia\&#39;s draconian immigration policy (i.e. if you don\&#39;t speak English, rack off!), such a story is unlikely to take place in reality. The other characters, sadly, also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, &#34;Dead Letter Office&#34; is certainly something a little different. It might not be to everyone\&#39;s taste but I liked it. Yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, it\&#39;s nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity (no chance of that in an Australian film). There ain\&#39;t any major laughs, there\&#39;s no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one-dimensional. But it\&#39;s the story that counts here and while it\&#39;s not earth-shattering in its magnificence, it\&#39;s a pleasant enough way of passing the time. It\&#39;s the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn\&#39;t really miss it if it wasn\&#39;t there.&#39;,
   &#34;Giving credit where it&#39;s due, only the technicolor, costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY&#39;s long career at Paramount. The script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a stock costume heroine role requiring her to look adoringly at Bing and little else except for warbling a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just plain awful! Mark Twain&#39;s wit is not evident in any of the screenplay. Only die-hard Crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction. Even the extras look as though they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re supposed to be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summing up: Dull as dishwater. Not recommended, even for children.&#34;,
   &#34;...when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Recasting Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a screenplay that was &#39;dated&#39; in 34 let alone 50. This sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles, unless they were dead. Though being older did not seem to matter to the Director. Nor that the Cars and Clothes in the background plates from 1934 did not seem match up too 1950s&#39; standards. Not even &#39;der Bingel&#39; singing can redeem this effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We rated both the original and the remake IMDb Four****Stars. Frank&#39;s touch was long gone and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. That did not stop Mr. Capra though. After floundering around the 50&#39;s making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again a fine cast was let down on that IMDb Six******Star effort compared too the originals Eight********Stars. Sometimes it is better to quit while you were still ahead, right after STATE OF THE UNION (1948).&#34;,
   &#34;I remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again, I wonder why. I guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down. Why oh why in so many English films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls? What is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the Confessions films but about a third of the way through (whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely Me Me Lai) the film asks us to start taking it seriously. Not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted. In short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend. Richard O&#39;Sullivan maybe, as such a central figure, could have helped but I reckon this to be one of his worst performances. Just worth it for the ladies.&#34;,
   &#39;First off, anyone who thinks this sequel to William Friedkin\&#39;s &#34;The French Connection&#34;, is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both. The problem with reviewing this film is that, a.) it\&#39;s a sequel to a brilliant movie, which always makes watching it objectively difficult, and b.) it\&#39;s directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors ever, so I wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new York city, because of his documentary-like approach to the action and story, Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever, i.e. &#34;The Manchurian Candidate&#34; and &#34;Seconds&#34;, and with his &#34;French Connection 2&#34; it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off. That fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by Gene Hackman himself really tells a lot about Hackman\&#39;s understanding about the original film too. It\&#39;s well known Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again, it\&#39;s also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional, loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character. it shows you Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who to make the movie and the story great. The plot point of Doyle becoming an addict is interesting, but doesn\&#39;t warrant the rest of the film. An unfortunate low point in Frankenhimer\&#39;s filmography.&#39;,
   &#34;This is really terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched, I would have a suitable reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell. I wouldn&#39;t have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing good in the movie. Everything yells tacky. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish. Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn&#39;t hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable.&#34;,
   &#34;Although there are some snippets in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform, these are not very well-developed, in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this program, as a whole, leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money, and for that it deserves some praise, almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to--very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you, if asked, they think the drug war is designed to solve. For example, while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80&#39;s, at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law, forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence, the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. Inexplicably, alcohol prohibition, the violence that ensued, and the subsequent reversal of prohibition, is totally ignored by this program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems, but not all users do their drugs in excess, just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government, for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science, has decided to totally prohibit, whose users it has decided to not-so-metaphorically wage war against, just forget about it. None of that is in here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this is hardly in the category of anti-drug propaganda. It is mostly an interesting neutrally-presented history of drugs in 20th century United States like marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and Oxycontin. But there is a significant element of various people&#39;s points of view with regard to drug laws, and most (but not all) of that is not very thoughtful or well-informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality, especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The criminal justice system, along with its often harsh life-ruining penalties, is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem, but unfortunately there&#39;s an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs, a lack of compassion for fellow humans, a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally-approved, perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry, and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. It&#39;s morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so, and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs, yet this program ignores it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in sum, the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. But when it comes to presenting a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy, and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives, it&#39;s pretty disappointing.&#34;,
   &#34;When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980&#39;s and like everyone else who has grown up in that era, have seen every 80&#39;s teen and summer camp movie out there. So I couldn&#39;t wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre. What a disappointment!! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with hardly any plot and no substance. And the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didn&#39;t come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive. The only good things about this film were the wardrobe, music, and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80&#39;s, and the same goes for the music. And the acting was top-notch throughout: almost all of Hollywood&#39;s best comedians were present. Too bad they didn&#39;t have better material to work with.&#34;,
   &#34;This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she wouldn&#39;t live in some commune with him (he was mad that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). Right then and there I had problems with the series - come on, I say to myself, is this the same noble Michael Stivic that countered Archie Bunker&#39;s right winged philosophies? The series went on, but it just didn&#39;t have any pizazz. Whatever momentum Sally Struthers gained from All the Family was long gone. Maybe, if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of All In The Family, it might have worked out. Ah well, that&#39;s show business.&#34;,
   &#34;First of all.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the hell? Why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night TV with the promise of disturbing, offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn&#39;t watch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the crap is funny about a dog being injured, a grandma getting her head knocked off...a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom? what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick. Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, should not even be allowed to walk the earth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But from what I hear its not even offensive...so...they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage...and they cant even pull that off.&#34;,
   &#39;Absolutely the most boring movie I have ever spent my money on.This was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputations on. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way. No acting talent shown -just reading a part. Alec can play realistic characters normally, Gwynyth made herself look ugly for an unrewarding part, Annette needs advise on how to pick the movies she chooses to play in as do all these big stars who have left me disappointed at the way they have all allowed their talents to be smothered in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment. &#34;Running with scissors&#34; leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion. There was not one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen. Maybe it was the director\&#39;s fault----whatever.&#39;,
   &#39;Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It\&#39;s more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. Not only that the storyline and script was wretched. I don\&#39;t know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situations were inane at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because those backwood &#34;idjits&#34; wouldn\&#39;t have been in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don\&#39;t mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you\&#39;re going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to not recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1.&#39;,
   &#34;The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful. It&#39;s a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil.&#34;,
   &#39;This was among the STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST of the anti-nuke films out of the 1980s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that a kid and a basketball star could &#34;change the world&#34; is pretty far-fetched, given how many &#34;children\&#39;s peace marches&#34; and &#34;celebrity protests&#34; there were and ARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to a TOTAL nuclear disarmament, because some apparatchik kids learned of a &#34;silent protest&#34; in the West, is ludicrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ended the Cold War? America\&#39;s tough, dare I say &#34;Reaganesque&#34; stance and the internal failures of socialism. It was NOT the peace marches, the &#34;die-ins&#34; or films like &#34;Amazing Grace &amp; Chuck&#34;, &#34;Miracle Mile&#34;, or &#34;Testament&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;m too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie I\&#39;ve ever seen. I\&#39;ve been working on a list of my favorite war movies: &#34;The Longest Day,&#34; &#34;To Hell and Back,&#34; &#34;Bridge on the River Kwai,&#34; (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. I\&#39;ve seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays. The plot, however isn\&#39;t a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It\&#39;s kind of like a traffic accident, though, I couldn\&#39;t seem to turn it off! A movie doesn\&#39;t need big money or great sets i.e. &#34;Twelve Angry Men&#34; and &#34;Lifeboat&#34; to be good... so budget is no excuse. What were they thinking?&#39;,
   &#34;An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), as a hottie Charles Bronson going around wiping up the &#39;scum&#39; that mugged her parents, or grandparents or something, and impressing young hunks with her karate skills. In a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws HER in jail, so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison-dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah. I guess there were a lot of movies like this? The script is dumber than usual if you can believe that. Mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co-produce her own Death Wish starring role, and I find that type sporadically endearing, but the movie is an ungainly apparatus. Competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here, and would actively undermine the fantastic mincing-incompetent DA and a judge that has got to be the producer&#39;s uncle.&#34;,
   &#34;This is a rip off of the old Frankenstein premise. An acclaimed scientist is killed in a freakish accident and his father, a noted brain surgeon saves the brain. It is then put into a robotic body of his own design. His brother, an electrical genius, gives the &#39;colossus&#39; impetus to transfer thoughts into motion. The whole project goes bad, when the creation goes berserk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special effects are undeveloped. The script is lacking. And it is humorous that this is not scary a bit. Well, very small kids will think this is good. If you are wide awake at three in the morning and this comes on....night, night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lead characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played the &#39;Colossus&#39;.&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this movie for 2 reasons--I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to carry a pretty dumb movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because it does explain his disdain for all things Christian, but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been. I see this movie more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this film) that he still exists. I actually enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the movie itself.&#39;,
   &#39;If you read my review of SyFy\&#39;s &#34;Dinoshark&#34;, you know that I can appreciate the low-budget schlock that these made-for-television movies can provide. They\&#39;re stupid...they\&#39;re silly...but they\&#39;re still pretty fun in a &#34;so bad, it\&#39;s good&#34; kind of way. So, still smacking with guilt for liking (and recommending) the undeniably hokey &#34;Dinoshark&#34;, I sat down to watch &#34;Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy&#34;, a SyFy Original Movie about a half-man, half-hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island. With the SyFy Channel\&#39;s sure-fire recipe for creating B-movie creature features and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it possibly go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually misses the mark...not by much, but enough to make me not recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, its titular monster, the dreaded hammerhead-human hybrid, takes a backseat to a bunch of faux-military thugs who really become the movie\&#39;s primary villain. Though the hammerhead does rack up the body count, he (or it or whatever you call the thing) only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after. The rest of the movie is filler, pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. That, to me, is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Read The Full Review On My Blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com&#39;,
   &#34;This movie was awful. I had a very difficult time watching this all the way through. I didn&#39;t get the point of the movie. What was the point of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, acting was bad and the story uninspiring. The two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among any of the cast members. I don&#39;t know this for a fact, but I suspect that most of the actors were first timers. The movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot. That indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie. I would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie. I want those two hours back! If you want to watch good, funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite instead.&#34;,
   &#34;I don&#39;t see how anyone who even likes Van Damne could like this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie actually starts out with some promise. I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent. The actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story. However, the film is all down hill from there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. That is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother is supposed to be skilled in Martial Arts, but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms. How convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman, and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot, action, etc. are just plain ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne is confronting an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him. Van Damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him,...while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo is throwing barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise. If your a Van Damne fan, save your time and see Hard Target or one of his earlier films.&#34;,
   &#34;The script is nice.Though the casting is absolutely non-watchable.No style. the costumes do not look like some from the High Highbury society. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Ms. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Ms. Paltrow, though in Ms. Paltrow&#39;s acting lies the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam undoubtedly is the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like Mr. Knightley in the TV-version. P.S.The spectator cannot see at all Mr. Elton-Ms. Smith relationship&#39;s development as it was in the motion version, so one cannot understand where was all Emma&#39;s trying of make a Elton-Smith match (besides of the portrait).&#34;,
   &#34;It makes one wonder how this show is still on the air. There&#39;s been one couple that has stayed together, married, and has children, but everyone else has broken up. What&#39;s the point of continuing this? The show can be entertaining at the beginning. You see all the girls swooning over one man, that almost all of them like instantly. It&#39;s just like in real life! The girls start to take sides, bitch one another out, and show their true selves (or so we think). But that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is true love exactly? How can you fall for someone when you&#39;re forced to pick them? This show is unbelievable. You thought dating online was bad, but people have to go on TV to find love? It&#39;s not realistic. How could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others, making out with them? None of these questions are answered, and finally when the show ends, you know there won&#39;t be a happy ending in the future. For all we know, everything is scripted.&#34;,
   &#39;Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. &#34;How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy&#34;? Gary Busey is know for his &#34;B&#34; movies, but this is a sure &#34;W&#34; movie. (W=waste).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take for example: about two dozen FBI &amp; local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is &#34;confused&#34; as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.&#39;,
   &#39;Certainly not horrible, but definitely not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is about pre-Apartheid South Africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man. The rich farmer/landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son, a fighter for black rights, was the one killed by Kumalo\&#39;s son. In this they connect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, for I have not seen it. Or the 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars for I have also not seen it; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I have seen; it has a much more urgent air to it, like it actually is trying to say something where the film Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it is going. Very &#34;Wishy-washy&#34;. I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I did enjoy the novel more than I enjoyed the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, this movie blew. Well, I guess it wasn\&#39;t that bad, --Five-out-of-ten, -- but it wasn\&#39;t that good either. Both of the leads, both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history (but that can be blamed on he screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who is also oddly off is game with this film, having also written the sublime The Pianist, and Being Julia). Among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racially or suspensefully. The music doesn\&#39;t help. The painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. One upside is the cinematography, with many rather good or great shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last, striking words of Alan Paton\&#39;s novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. It is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown. I don\&#39;t know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your time.&#39;,
   &#39;Oh man, what was Sam Mraovich thinking? What was anyone who was involved in this &#34;film&#34; thinking? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of &#34;Ben and Arthur&#34;: Director, writer, producer (also EXECUTIVE producer!), caster, lead star- you name it, he did it. And he (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is wrong with this film? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- *groan*). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. To make things worse, Ben\&#39;s crazy &#34;ex-wife&#34; (they don\&#39;t exactly divorce), Tammy (Julie Belknap) is steaming mad that Ben\&#39;s left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together (saying that she can be gay, too!) and Arthur\&#39;s Christian devoted, excessively hypocritical, equally batty as Tammy brother, Victor, is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs (ie. Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate, plus many, many more) and plot holes to boot (Victor calls killing Arthur &#34;The Final Plan&#34; which later changes to &#34;The Final Deed&#34;; Arthur and the private (intern) detective drive the same car, blah, blah, blah). The &#34;actors&#34; are all very bad and are way, way over the top; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is &#34;I don\&#39;t make sense? You don\&#39;t make sense! I make sense, that\&#39;s who makes sense!&#34;) and there so much more wrong with the &#34;movie&#34; that I can\&#39;t write them all down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about &#34;Ben and Arthur&#34; is that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic (see his fake reviews for &#34;Ben &amp; Arthur&#34; and obvious comments by him on YouTube.). Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to conclude, forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- &#34;Ben and Arthur&#34; will knock them right off that title, even Paris Hilton movies look like &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; compared to the monstrosity known as &#34;Ben and Arthur&#34;.&#39;,
   &#39;I have a severe problem with this show, several actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I\&#39;ll go into more depth later on: superficial characters, a laugh-track and boring humour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don\&#39;t wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn\&#39;t) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I\&#39;ll summarize: Friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV, &#34;Two And A Half Men&#34; and &#34;The King Of Queens&#34; as the television executives. Now then, on with the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn\&#39;t Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel\&#39;s enemy? Why doesn\&#39;t Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right, cause he\&#39;s the dumb one and he\&#39;s comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be &#34;comedy&#34; requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office, Arrested Development).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn\&#39;t right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So now I\&#39;ve provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven\&#39;t heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have watched very little of &#34;Friends&#34; in my life, but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. If you\&#39;ve read this far, thank you, and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned.&#39;,
   &#39;The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female lead and the FBI guy went to the alleged killers location, Mr. FBI handed the female a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. One is left to ponder would an FBP agent hand a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Ms. Xavier appears to be a very attractive female. It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen. It would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out.&#39;,
   &#34;Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the lip syncing is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what&#39;s going on, only to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting their time. I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time! This could of been an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I&#39;m sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but sorry guys-story telling is what makes a movie.&#34;,
   &#34;I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is...my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this. Not the worst acting I&#39;ve ever seen, but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves a bit to be desired. There wasn&#39;t a single &#39;scare&#39; moment in the movie, with the exception of when they were watching the movie &#39;Halloween&#39; on the TV. All around, it seems like it could&#39;ve been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss as I didn&#39;t recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I could&#39;ve said &#39;oh yeah, there she is&#39;. I&#39;m so glad I saw this in a hotel and didn&#39;t pay for it as I&#39;d be real ticked if I had payed a cent to see this. I normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie, but this one is an exception. It&#39;s so bad that it&#39;s not even that amusing so-good-it&#39;s-bad....it&#39;s just plain bad.&#34;,
   &#39;Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick on the technical flaws - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike, and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe, which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m glad some people liked this, but I hated this film. It had a very good idea for a story line, but that\&#39;s where it ended. It was badly written, badly acted and badly made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It had some interesting plot points, but they were just skipped over too fast, the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits, like lying about why she was kidnapped, and ditch the dross. Instead it was &#34;what\&#39;s going on?&#34;, 5 seconds later they tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film had no suspense, and I was bored from start to end. I just wanted it to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Go and rent misery, or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end.&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;m not a big fan of rom/coms at the best of times. A few have been quite good (check of Dream for an Insomniac), but this one is just more of the same but less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a running time of 100min, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins. The only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out Lee&#39;s character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is AVOID. I gaurentee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $$&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 of out 10 (And only cos I&#39;m a big Lee fan)&#34;,
   &#39;Beautifully photographed and ably acted, generally, but the writing is very slipshod. There are scenes of such unbelievability that there is no joy in the watching. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for instance, is so contrived that I groaned out loud. And the &#34;emotion-light bulb connection&#34; seems gimmicky, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No major effort on the part of the viewer required. But Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than this.&#39;,
   &#34;Written and acted by sincere amateurs, produced by some exploitation monger, this is dull and hard to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the worst movie ever, but at least schlock like _Plan 9 From Outer Space_ usually had a real actor or two. I&#39;d recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only to hardcore ironists and hardcore Dispensationalists. I&#39;m neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t believe me? Watch it for free (albeit sourced from poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relevant links added mostly to reach IMDb&#39;s 10-line minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/&#34;,
   &#34;Let&#39;s see where to begin... bad acting; I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d even call it that, as it more along the lines of a no-effort script read. The actors didn&#39;t even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless. Sure there was a scene or two with nudity, but that couldn&#39;t save this movie from it&#39;s lifeless characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Budget? Did this movie even have a budget? It seemed like they used less money than I&#39;ve seen in a home-shot YouTube video. Bad lighting, props, poor sound post production. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. Story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so, but there was no life to this flick; I don&#39;t care who directed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom. Don&#39;t waste your time or you&#39;ll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review. Check the ratings, you&#39;ll see the 1&#39;s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10&#39;s with hardly anything in between. Wish I would have looked a little closer before wasting my time. What a suck-fest!&#34;,
   &#39;The &#34;saucy&#34; misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in London on the same day in the early 1970s. There\&#39;s a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry On-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time, including Man About the House star Richard O\&#39;Sullivan, future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne (playing a sheik). There\&#39;s a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display, for those who like that kind of thing (but obviously nothing hardcore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she\&#39;s a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child &amp; dresses to deliberately show her private parts; in another more serious film, she would be a psychiatric case. The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing, being seduced by a middle-aged rocker, losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her. These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we\&#39;ve ended up with, in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives (there\&#39;s a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school roué). The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl (future cannibal film veteran Me Me Lay) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer, falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all, except some orientalist notion that &#34;Chinese birds are inscrutable, ain\&#39;t they?!&#34; The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there\&#39;s a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations. The end is striking, as Mayne\&#39;s sheik for no earthly reason (except they have to end the film somehow) whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade, which they are all delighted about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuff and nonsense for the most part then, but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest, which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks.&#39;,
   &#34;There&#39;s nothing new here. All the standard romantic-comedy scenes, even down to the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman flying away. The only thing that saves this is the acting of Alison Eastwood &amp; some of the minor characters (blink and you&#39;ll miss Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously had some fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn it off when the pair are in bliss, and you won&#39;t have to go through the inevitable plot pain.&#34;,
   &#34;Considering that I felt like picking up a new Jet Li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting, I grabbed this title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatly, this movie contains more gun battles (ala Chow Yun Fat but nowhere near as good), than Jet Li and company&#39;s acrobatic fighting. Thus it was a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The faucet fighting was interesting and even funny, considering this was something totaly unexpected in a Jet Li film for me, more on the line of say Jackie Chan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas I&#39;d recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master, or even the Enforcer over this dissapointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for overall movie score&#34;,
   &#34;Teamo Supremo are three kids, consisting of their leader- Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battlecry (buza! chika! woopa!) and outfit and moves. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing at that game. They lead normal lives as well, and have family and school duties, but most of the action takes place away from school fighting villains. The villains all have rather unique and singular traits, such as Mister Vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are but act anyway. From an evil robot to a wicked baron the three have to encounter them and stop their evil, and often strange, plans to gain power, take revenge etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The animation itself is quite nice and smooth, but the style appears to be simple on purpose. The backgrounds have overlapping colour and the buildings seem futuristic. The music is quite nice, and the show isn&#39;t too bad altogether, although the style isn&#39;t my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plots are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and one can&#39;t blame them for that. However this would not be in the same rank as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.&#34;,
   &#39;Perhaps I missed the meeting when the meaning of &#34;B-movie&#34; was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. You want a good synopsis of this movie? Take Aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that was good about it, and that\&#39;s pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 minutes into the movie, the &#34;V-SAN squad&#34; (that\&#39;s the dumbest acronym I\&#39;ve ever heard) checks out a &#34;base&#34; thats been massacred by vampires and then they climb down (DOWN? What?) a ladder obviously attached to a billboard with an obvious present day train in the background. When is this supposed to take place? 2210. Okay...(hold on, I\&#39;ll get back to that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. the characters. Wow, well there\&#39;s the token lesbian Asian chick, the redneck cowboy wannabe, the weathered captain, the goth vampire/Hot Topic part-time cashier, and the wussy noob second in command. All of them are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost pained me to see Micheal Ironside in this flick. Isn\&#39;t he getting enough money being the voice of Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell? Pretty much the only thing original about Vampire Wars is about how bad it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching this afterbirth of a film, the only amusement I got was from the feeble attempts at set-making. Since when does taping PCI computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship? The money required to do this film could have been put to much more better use.&#39;,
   &#39;Patricia Hunter: Oh, professor, do you also make a habit of collecting coffins? Dr. Lorenz: Why, yes, in a manner of speaking. I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) vehicle where he plays the mad scientist. I was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luana Walters (Girls in Prison) was really appealing as a sensual reporter, Patricia Hunter&lt; who was to be a victim, but woman-power trumps evil scientist every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2\&#39;11&#34; Angelo Rossitto and creepy Frank Moran , who liked to stoke the women\&#39;s hair added to the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting look at a 40s horror film.&#39;,
   &#34;There&#39;s only one thing I&#39;m going to say about cat in the hat...as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie it sucks...I lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren&#39;t exactly kid appropriate. Oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was annoying...as for the plot I completely forgot. Who cares it sucked anyway. i&#39;m not sure why Mike Myers joined but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in Austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly succeeded- but so what it was annoying. don&#39;t see it-it belongs in the bottom 100.............................. the jokes are so unkiddy it&#39;s funny&#34;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t know what it is with these Brady kids. First, Barry Williams publicly brags about having sexy with his TV sister, Maureen McCormick, then about dating his TV mom, Florence Hederson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets in trouble for drunk driving. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum might have had a little same-sex fling on the side. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early-20s during his stint on &#34;The Surreal Life&#34;, which at first was fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile relationship. The last episode, where she posed for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a scrapbook to give to Christopher for his birthday, was not a good move on her part. And he dealt with it in a very mature fashion, just picking up and leaving to clear his head. I think he was always bowing to her every need and now he\&#39;s finally taking a stand. And I hate to say it, but I think she abuses him, verbally. The way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she reams him for every little thing. Also she talks openly about having flings with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men, which is not something any self-respecting human being should do when already married to someone. If this were a man talking down to his wife like that, and going out every night partying and having sex with other people, everyone would be rallying behind the wife to leave him. Why should this be any different. What started out as a cute little crush on another reality show blossomed into a huge disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things. I feel sorry for her, but Chris needs to rid himself of her, because he is a good man who cannot afford to be humiliated like this.&#39;,
   &#39;It seems to me that Stephen King\&#39;s &#34;Bachman&#34; pen-name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer, rawer, more mean-spirited stuff that he wanted to write without \&#39;contaminating\&#39; his \&#39;brand name\&#39;. If you look back at the &#34;Bachman Books&#34; (Running Man, The Long Walk, Roadwork, Thinner) you notice they have a sealed-in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King. I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated, blood-covered, emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom...but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit, and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling. Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly. (BTW, &#34;Pet Semetary&#34; could have easily been a Bachman book if King hadn\&#39;t revealed the alias by then. And &#34;The Dark Half&#34; seems to be at least partially about his &#34;Bachman&#34; persona.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Thinner&#34; was the last Bachman book, and man, with its themes of class warfare, revenge, and death by starvation, it is nasty. So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a &#34;TV Movie Of the Week&#34; level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release. (These days, something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable). The makeup work and the striking motif (starving to death in the midst of plenty, a metaphor for the overfed, undernourished American middle class if there ever was one) is all that keeps you watching this misfire. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What went wrong? My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe, but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here (with the exception of Joe Monetegna) simply can\&#39;t carry the movie. And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure. Plus he couldn\&#39;t leave the plot alone, and his changes don\&#39;t really help. The script and dialog ought to work, but mostly the movie just lies there. Everything is muffled, dull, airless, and no fun to watch...with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting....thinner, and thinner, and thinner. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other have pointed out, &#34;Thinner&#34; is by no means the worst King movie ever made (or even the second worst). And it does have a dreadful, compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work. But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations.&#39;,
   &#39;Well, if it weren\&#39;t for Ethel Waters and a 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. (here billed without the Jr.), Rufus Jones for President would be one of the worst representations of African-American stereotypes I\&#39;ve seen from the early talkie era and wouldn\&#39;t have been worth seeing because of that. Ms. Waters is excellent here singing &#34;Am I Blue?&#34; and &#34;Underneath Our Harlem Moon&#34; while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult. He\&#39;s so good tap-dancing here that for awhile I thought he was a little person with decades of experience. So if you\&#39;re willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for President should provide some good enjoyment. P.S. This marks the fourth time today I\&#39;ve seen and heard the song, &#34;I\&#39;ll Be Glad When You\&#39;re Dead You Rascal You&#34; performed on film, this time by Davis. Must have been a very popular song about this time.&#39;,
   &#34;The plot, character development, and gags in this movie are all extremely weak. Quite a waste of time. The conclusion of Saving Grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles. There was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible. The drug gags are cliched and much of the movie doesn&#39;t ring true to life. The plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters aren&#39;t developed enough to care. Then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time.&#34;,
   &#39;The dudes at MST3K should see this dog of a film. It\&#39;s basically about a dopey hack actor in Hollywood who can\&#39;t land any acting gigs. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what does this dumb actor do? He dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a L.A. surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles. You\&#39;ll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie\&#39;s inadvertently funny scenes. Like when the actor dude\&#39;s girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like, &#34;How could you do this to me?&#34; And why is she crying? Cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs. This movie makes no sense at ALL! The actor who played the governor on Benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog. This movie will crack you up, trust me. You talking\&#39; to me?!&#39;,
   &#34;This movie was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad this movie is! It is a movie in Hollywood style about a movie in a movie. Shades shows so clear we aren&#39;t ready to produce &#39;big Hollywood movies&#39;. I am not a movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. Like my subject line says, it is nothing, and then looped. You could just stare to the television as well, without really seeing anything. That was the feeling we&#39;ve got when we saw Shades. Shades is a BAD PRODUCTION!!!&#34;,
   &#34;Just had to write that one liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I&#39;ve seen in recent years . I have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one, the script . It is a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he&#39;s gonna do another film about the general. My advice is don&#39;t waste your time.&#34;,
   &#39;Well where to start here? Straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma. Had this film come out of Italy in, say, 1975, been directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starred David Hess, then I\&#39;d be lapping it up faster than Labrador drinks water on a summer\&#39;s day. Because whilst Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed has produced a rape/revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in England, and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken Rodriguez to turn Rose McGowan\&#39;s leg into a machine gun. Because if you want to play grindhouse bingo, then let me call out the \&#39;numbers\&#39;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Rich, high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and, equally implausibly, gets the hots for him. Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Gratuitous shots of said high-flying career woman in various states of nudity. Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in. Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape. Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off. Bingo! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plotwise, Straightheads is pretty basic stuff: Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss. On the way home, they upset three locals in a Landover who take their revenge by giving Dyer a good shoeing and gang raping Anderson. The couple then set about getting their revenge. So far, so &#34;Straw Dogs&#34;, &#34;Late Night Trains&#34;, &#34;House on the Edge of the Park&#34;, &#34;I Spit On Your Grave&#34; etc etc. So why didn\&#39;t I think much of this film? A number of reasons: I suppose first off, having the likes of Gillian Anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better, but it\&#39;s the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because whenever anyone sits down to watch Hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70\&#39;s, then they always know exactly what they are getting - low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator. The baddies terrorise and murder the goodies, the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back, and everyone goes home satisfied, their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As writer and director however, Dan Reed clearly believes Straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that, and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there. For instance, when Anderson and Dyer are planning revenge on their attackers, they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter!!! The casual and audacious way that Reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw-dropping, it\&#39;s almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audience\&#39;s moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they\&#39;ve just sat through something of significance. To make sure we \&#39;get it\&#39;, at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time, ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter, but Reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of Anderson rough-handled and raped across the bonnet of her car. Gratuitous does not enter into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being told his reasons for raping her, Anderson ties him over a table, rams the business end of a sniper rifle (complete with bulky silencer, just in case anyone wasn\&#39;t clear on the phallic imagery) up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger, telling Dyer (who has no such moral qualms) that \&#39;it\&#39;s over\&#39;. Dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell may have discussed in their rooms back at Cambridge over tea and cakes. It is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, Ms Anderson acts her guts out throughout the film. It\&#39;s obvious she wants to leave Scully far behind and, bless her, she certainly does that; one wonders what Mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun? Dyer, on the other hand, does what he\&#39;s done in virtually every film he\&#39;s made to date - that is, plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin, a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching. This is particularly true at the closing scene where, after murdering his assailants in cold blood, Dyer gazes at the camera in, what I\&#39;m sure is meant to be, a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome, but instead is far more reminiscent of Oliver Hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after Stan has landed him in yet another fine mess. Which incidentally, sums up this film quite nicely.&#39;,
   &#39;You know the story..Pretty kids alone in the woods,when BAM!something starts cutting them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this crap is no different.A bunch of kids return to a cabin where the male leads twin brother disappeared for years before.Suddenly an &#34;UNKOWN CREATURE&#34; stars cutting them up,and their only help is a doctor/biker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say this film was bad is an understatement,it\&#39;s smut! The acting was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creature looked very cheesy. And as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist ending,which they do not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one bright spot to this film- LOST star Maggie Grace as the female lead.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie &#34;Sholay&#34;, but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie (acting, script, songs, music, comedy, action etc) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After making movies like Rangeela, Satya, and Company he pulled a Coppola (Godfather) on us; What were you thinking RGV? Anyways, the story is, though hard to follow, is almost like the Old sholay. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, new kid on the block playing Ajay (Jay,sholay). Both &#34;bad yet funny&#34; friends help a cop capture a bad guy first. Later in the movie, now Retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. In case you haven\&#39;t been watching Bollywood movies, the Good guys win in the end. There I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!&#39;,
   &#39;Even though many people here praises this movie, I have to warn you. It has no logic whatsoever. I think that Basinger does a decent job at acting, but you can\&#39;t make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scene paints a good picture for you of the movie : while Basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and gaze upon a picture she finds from her pocket. The picture is from her daughter and it reads &#34;we love you mommy&#34;. Who does something like that ? What the eff? And believe me when I say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie. Someone stated that this is a &#34;hidden gem&#34;. Well, I have to strongly disagree, this movie has stayed hidden for a reason. And it\&#39;s not a gem. Oh, and please, I don\&#39;t even want to start commenting about the red toolbox. It hurts my brain :D Usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts, but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic. But, i still give it a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic, it has certain mood that kept me watching till the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you choose to watch this, you know you have been warned.&#39;,
   &#39;As a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of BSG and the stand alone feature BSG Razor I was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. Usually I have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little CGI money spent. This prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous &amp; unbelievable. This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Restricted. Not that teens don\&#39;t love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex &amp; violence &amp; heavy dance music. Its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth &amp; reason or political &amp; religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me. These kids are definitely not from this planet. The movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining. But this old concept was far better portrayed &amp; much more believable in the brilliant, classic original &#34;Frankenstein&#34; with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror film. No surprise there! Overall this movie was bland &amp; unoriginal &amp; cheap looking, using recycled CGI of Caprica from BSG. I doubt I\&#39;ll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless of course I happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure. Zzzzzzzz&#39;,
   &#34;WARNING: This review contains SPOILERS. Do not read if you don&#39;t want some points revealed to you before you watch the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can&#39;t fail.&#39; Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director&#39;s credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan&#39;s Cheerleaders?&#39; Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,&#39; made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice&#39; and completely miss out on `The Return.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don&#39;t believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost&#39; for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer dog at his side, is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item. You know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick-or-treaters at Halloween, the kind that you shake to make them glow? Schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people. It&#39;s the second-worst effect in the movie. Every time Schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick, the scene&#39;s atmosphere suddenly turns dark, like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement. It ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what does all this lead up to? It&#39;s hard to tell when the final, confusing scene arrives. See, Burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that Shepherd found as some kind of `calling card,&#39; but none of it makes sense. Why do Shepherd and Vincent age and Schiavelli does not? Schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants Shepherd dead, but even that doesn&#39;t make much sense when you really think about it. I mean, why doesn&#39;t he kill Jan-Michael Vincent? After all, he had twenty-five years to do it. And the aliens won&#39;t need him if Shepherd is dead anyhow, so why try to kill her? Speaking of the aliens, it is never clear what they really wanted out of Shepherd and Vincent. What is their goal? Why do they wait so long to intervene? How could they be so sure Shepherd would come back? Not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made `The Return&#39; any more pleasant. You would still have bad lines, really bad acting, particularly by Shepherd, cheesy effects, and poor direction. Luckily, the stars escaped from this movie. Cybill Shepherd soon went on to star in `Moonlighting&#39; with Bruce Willis. Jan-Michael Vincent went on to be featured in dozens of B-movies, often in over-the-top parts. Raymond Burr made a pile of Perry Mason television movies right up until his death. Vincent Schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films. Martin Landau, who played a kooky law enforcement officer, quickly made the terrific `Alone in the Dark&#39; and the awful `The Being&#39; before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently. You can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to `The Return.&#39; Zantara&#39;s score: 2 out of 10.&#34;,
   &#39;Why me? Why should I be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot?! At least if I can warn other people off, it will have been worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise, I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear. The movie was slow, had PAINFULLY little character development, and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an LA-style token black man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Note, though, that this movie does not DEPICT what we have come to think of as an &#34;LA lifestyle&#34;, it is a wonderful example of the products that ARISE from it.&#39;,
   &#39;&#34;Raising Victor Vargas&#34; is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y. Times crossword puzzle at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona, you don\&#39;t have to &#34;Pause&#34; the DVD. Just let it roll, \&#39;cause you won\&#39;t be missing anything really important. No twists, turns, or tension. It\&#39;s not really an ethnic movie, it\&#39;s a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. It made very little difference. I\&#39;ve seen it all a zillion times before. Just plug in a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family, or an Irish family. Just the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s funny that the critics here couldn\&#39;t get the locale straight. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some the Bronx, and another Brooklyn. As a life-long New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other Latinos. They lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave. Some interaction with non-Latinos might have created some excitement, interest, or tension. Remember West Side Story?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for the oft-criticized cinematography. I don\&#39;t know if it was my TV or what, but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me. The apt, the furniture, and the faces were all ORANGE. What was that supposed to mean? And the apt. did look pretty cramped to me. Somebody here mentioned that the old apt\&#39;s/tenements had very big rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And another annoying thing ....This is the second family movie I\&#39;ve seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy &#34;jerking off&#34;. Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch? Please spare me! What\&#39;s up with these directors? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So &#34;Victor Vargas&#34; is a pleasant little movie. It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. But the writers let them down, giving them a flat, unspectacular script to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the &#34;fast forward&#34; button.&#39;,
   &#39;After having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was: Is this supposed to be irony or not? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew this film was not meant to be ironic. So, the story tells us about an US-American Super-Doc saving a south American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen. The film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example.&#39;,
   &#34;People, please don&#39;t bother to watch this movie! This movie is bad! It&#39;s totally waste of time. I don&#39;t see any point here. It&#39;s a Stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor. I rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again.&#34;,
   &#34;A not bad but also not so great heist film. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas&#39;s infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there&#39;s at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo &amp; Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).&#34;,
   &#39;I found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow &#34;upbeat&#34; ending that didn\&#39;t ring true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn\&#39;t my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and I got very tired of its &#34;one note&#34; theme and couldn\&#39;t wait for it to end--in fact I almost stopped about halfway through. The whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. A small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn\&#39;t make it with me, and I love good, small films! This one just didn\&#39;t jell, though I kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their &#34;Year\&#39;s 10 Best&#34; list. I\&#39;d strongly recommend watching &#34;The House of Sand&#34; instead--now there\&#39;s a good, small film!&#39;,
   &#34;There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn&#39;t one of them! It&#39;s a shame The Child isn&#39;t better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). This is all well and good, except for the fact that it&#39;s boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it&#39;s not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. There&#39;s really not much I can say about the film overall as there isn&#39;t much to it. The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly don&#39;t recommend it.&#34;,
   &#34;I wanted to see it because of two reasons. One, it was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, the Bogart part was played by Jack Palance, whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility, as in The Big Knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; only here, the actors don&#39;t care, the director is lost in his thoughts, and who knows what the producer was thinking. Jack Palance is getting bored looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters is asking herself what she&#39;s doing in this film. I don&#39;t even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course, they had to use the dog story again! They surely could have come up with some different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot High Sierra, but that definitely doesn&#39;t add any quality to the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a waste of time if you&#39;ve seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir. As for me, I&#39;d rather die than see it one more time...&#34;,
   &#39;I just watched this movie last night, and I HAD to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film. In a word - don\&#39;t. I seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino/Eddie Murphy phase, i.e. every other word was a curse word. I don\&#39;t have a problem with profuse cursing, as in &#34;Good Will Hunting&#34;, provided it helps to delve more into the characters. In this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional *gasp* or laughter from the audience. The three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype, the wall street jerk, the coffee house jerk, and the &#34;I\&#39;m-Not-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side&#34; slightly-less-of-a-jerk. You just don\&#39;t give a damn about any of them! They are all shallow, unredemable losers who you WANT to see lose. For those who dare, this film does have a couple funny moments, the very beginning, and the very end. The toilet/vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda &#34;Uh, yeah&#34; way. Really though, I would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies.&#39;,
   &#39;I actually didn\&#39;t mind the Geico commercials the first 50 of so times I saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing, BUT SERIOUSLY! This is the BEST thing that these people could come up with?!? This show sucks! It is bland and feels like watching an episode of &#34;The Office&#34; with the characters disguised as cavemen (I know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but &#34;The Office&#34; just does not do it for me). Okay, I get it: we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual who really just has a barely-functioning intellect; and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT!!! I have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as I do on TV...why would I want to waste another 1/336th of my week watching more of those type nominates?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it, you still delude yourself into believing that this is entertainment.&#39;,
   &#34;Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze. Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. It&#39;s unbelievably bad. Just to let you in on how bad it is, I&#39;ll offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see corn filled crap like this? There is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. I&#39;m really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, I&#39;m dumbstruck. It&#39;s so bad I can&#39;t even find the words. RATING: ZERO out of *****.&#34;,
   &#34;This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen... Unfortunately, I am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it&#39;s not made for t.v. When looking at the box it says it is rated R for gore and some language... Where was the gore? Was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore? I could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue. There wasn&#39;t even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie. Sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid, but this was just sad.&#34;,
   &#34;Resnais, wow! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour. The opening voice-over with old, embellished inter-titles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens (like the old hand crankers) on a black &amp; white placard. The camera backs off (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can&#39;t blame it on the subtitles). Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time &amp; musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out. I endured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#39;t get much better. I&#39;ll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We don&#39;t even see their faces half the time (as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera). People flit on &amp; off stage like moths around a lamp, and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot. It&#39;s as if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie. With bad songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at the camera techniques, lighting and scenery which were all, I admit, excellent. But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I&#39;ll try watching the end. Aw, who am I kidding. I have more important things to do. I&#39;m sure you do, too. Skip this.&#34;,
   &#34;Well, what was fun... except for the fun part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than &#39;Lazarus&#39; and &#39;Ghost in the Machine&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s start with the good. The teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being the great animal lover that I am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then there&#39;s all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. Little made sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa??? the dialog was also pretty awful. There were about one or two quotable lines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and worst of all, having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me. In the end... what&#39;s the point? they all pretty much died. We didn&#39;t learn anything, we weren&#39;t entertained, and I couldn&#39;t even find Sophia&#39;s death sad... just very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* star. shame because Season 2 was doing so well.&#34;,
   &#39;Luckily I did not pay to see this movie. Also, I cannot even reveal any spoilers because I willingly WALKED OUT after forty minutes of the movie. It was that bad. I laughed once, when the Yahoo! billboard fell on the guy, and the theme song came on. However, that was only because I thought it was making fun of it, but then I realized it was yet ANOTHER product placement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the cartoon. I used to watch it almost religiously. (although i missed the last episode. I heard that they show Dr. Claw and it was nothing more than a Claw, somebody comment on the show\&#39;s page) The cartoon had Penny and Brain alot more than the movie had, as to that point. I hated the setup of the whole thing, reminiscent of Robocop. Then Broderick screws with the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget. He is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was. Another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point I saw, except for the oil slick. He also screwed with the tone of &#34;Wowsers&#34; which used to be in an excited tone. I felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly. Everybody else felt that way too. Us 14-17 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon. I was taken aback at how retarded the movie was. It relied on sight gags, and stupid dialogue for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along. Product placement is pointless in this film, and it shows. The wise-cracking car is not that good at cracking wise. The gadgets look nice, but they were almost overly glossy. The cartoon was a better look. The silly scenes were crap. In the 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, not one laugh was heard, and they laughed at the Dudley-Do-Right preview. This movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. I highly recommend &#34;The Iron Giant,&#34; which was sad, but very very good. This movie is a travesty to the whole family drama.------------1&#39;,
   &#34;Following the disasterous Revolution, this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of Goldcrest and thus the British Film Industry. The film is absolute pants, it&#39;s full of music from the attempted mid-80&#39;s jazz revival and based on a book &amp; author that was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly sank back into obscurity. Temple searched for ages trying to find Suzette and came up with 8th Wonders Patsy Kensett another person who was briefly popular at the time. By the time the film came out of post production the Jazz revival was over, as was Kensett&#39;s career and the film met a totally uncaring film public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst/campest/cheesiest acting to ever grace the British silver screen watching it almost 20 years on and the film is truely cringeworthy.&#34;,
   &#39;When I first saw the preview for this movie, I really couldn\&#39;t wait to see it. The plot seemed good and the setting was great. I mean, a slasher movie that takes place on prom night, great idea!! And the plot: A High School teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students, goes crazy, gets arrested, and escapes three years later on prom night! Prom night, a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable, turns into hell!! However, I saw it and was extremely disappointed. It was not only the worst &#34;horror movie&#34; I have ever seen, but it was one of the worst movie in general that I have ever seen!! First of all, it wasn\&#39;t even scary. There was not one moment in that movie when I jumped out of my seat. Also, the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull. All the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats. Also there was absolutely no gore (its rated PG-13). The scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl. He slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them (they don\&#39;t actually show him cutting her throat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie. He isn\&#39;t mysterious, creepy, or scary. He\&#39;s just this guy who kills people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, everything in the movie was so cliché. An example is when, at the end, the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment, the detective shoots and kills him. Also, every single thing in this movie was so predictable. The victim, after seeing the guy with a knife, runs for her life, hides, thinks she gets away, and then the killer just pops out and kills her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the sequence of the movie was extremely bad. The guy goes into the hotel, kills a few people, the bodies are discovered, someone pulls the fire alarm, and everyone evacuates. The main character forgets something in her room, has an encounter with the killer, runs and escapes. Thats it! She and her boyfriend go home, the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house, finds the girl, then gets killed by the detective. The movie sequence was so stupid and cliché.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good, trust me, don\&#39;t waste your time or money. No wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater. My friend and I, along with these two girls sitting in the back, were the only ones in the theater. That should have told me something about the movie beforehand.&#39;,
   &#39;Of course, &#34;Flatley&#34; is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer, but I think Michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title: &#34;Feet of Flames&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One really can\&#39;t resist recommending Desenex Foot Spray to the retiring (and clearly, ailing) Flatley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might add that, much like that cheering London crowd (per review below), I too am enthusiastic about this being his last live performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Hinting that it may be his last live performance, Flatley is cheered on by an enthusiastic London crowd.&#34; ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide&#39;,
   &#39;A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.&#39;,
   &#34;First of all, f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the f14&#39;s and f18&#39;s cannot change their appearances; they are not transformers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, the f16 has only one m61 cannon, not two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not the least, at the end of the film, Seagle selected sidewinder missile. But somehow when he pulled the trigger, the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick. As I have the experience of seeing f18&#39;s and f14&#39;s being mysteriously transformed into f16&#39;s, this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me. However, there is still one question I have to ask: How did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When students hand in really bad work, teachers assign 0&#39;s. Now I think for the sake of properly marking this film, IMDb should seriously consider adding a &#39;0/10&#39; option. Otherwise, it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10...&#34;,
   &#34;Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go-round, although I&#39;m not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last flick, is resurrected through voodoo, and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer Cordell is very fond of. I missed part of this early &#39;90s low-budget quickie, but it was pleasing to see Cordell wracking up the body count in various, gruesome ways. Problem is, the overall film is pretty static, and Cordell simply ain&#39;t Jason or Freddy. The interest wanes pretty fast, even with that grand B-movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains scrambled. Stick with the first film in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting, all at the same time.&#34;,
   &#34;May I start off by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much. I wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent. With this said, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say that I lay almost all the blame on the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an outstanding performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well, and Eliza Dushku is currently the it girl in Hollywood. I don&#39;t think any of the actors really got into the script, and I understand why. To say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement. It did have the twists and turns you would expect, but they just didn&#39;t lead anywhere... except to more confusion. I just found the ending very anti-climatic, because it just didn&#39;t seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that I had about the storyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I can&#39;t. In all honesty, the only thing I think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it.&#34;,
   &#39;Well, I couldn\&#39;t even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values. It\&#39;s a B-movie action-flick, by the director of &#34;Commando&#34;, that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good B-movie with enough entertainment value in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s an \&#39;90\&#39;s flick but foremost the movie should remind of an \&#39;80\&#39;s action movie, when these type of B-movies were at an all time high. These movies always went over-the-top and never paid much attention to its story or acting. It was all about blowing stuff up, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. This movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet I really didn\&#39;t liked watching this movie as much as I like watching some similar type of movies. Hard to say why really, since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s probably because the movie is being often far too silly. All these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it. The fighting, Dolph Lundgren running around shirtless, the characters, the story. It all just isn\&#39;t very good because it\&#39;s often just too lame for words. The story at times isn\&#39;t even trying to make a bit sense and what\&#39;s even the main plot-line of the overall movie? Its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences, gun fights and such. And those sequences aren\&#39;t even much good to watch really. The moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really, from the man who brought us &#34;Commando&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s foremost a Dolph Lundgren, in which he gets to play the big action hero star, who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl, played by Tia Carrere. This all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence I have seen in any movie really. Both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the characters work out really. The good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one. They simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest, or to inform anyone about their discoveries. Not even when they find out a big Japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of L.A. and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling. And also just think about it for a moment, what is Brandon Lee\&#39;s overall purpose in the movie? The movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too silly, lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#39;,
   &#39;The first noticeable problem about this awkwardly titled film is its casting. Ann Nelson plays the grandma here. Three years after this, she would star in &#34;Airplane!&#34; as the woman who hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get that image out of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt Boston is a fifteen year old with problems. He has headaches. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a massive heart attack. A chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil is going on with this family. First she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a tale in flashback that fills the entire first half of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She and Grandpa bought an RV, cheap, and drive it around to all the tourist traps in desert California. The RV soon has a mind of its own, going off the road and such. Then, large boulders begin hurling themselves at it. The elderly couple are appropriately afraid, but stay in the vehicle in order to move the plot along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, Grandpa has a heart attack after being stranded on the RV roof when it goes for another unplanned ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boston\&#39;s mom begins talking to some Native American mummies she has lying around the house. She fancies herself an author, and makes copious notes about the musty corpses. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes, and uses her imagination to fill in the blanks. We see the mother semi-flip out, but her mental breakdown occurs offscreen, much like Gramps\&#39; heart attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the patient de resistance, little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own tale. He thinks mom is wigging out (this was made in 1977). Apparently, mom is making the astral bodies of the Native American mummies sort of fly through the air. One hits Matt like a bee hits a windshield, and Matt begins acting all crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt into the desert. Matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair now, and the trio confront the unseen (and unexplained) forces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flocker has no sense of scene construction. The one pro here involves the RV stranded in a salt flat in the desert. In the distance, the couple notice some boulders rolling toward the RV. This is a pretty creepy little scene that is eventually overplayed. As the boulders begin hurling themselves toward the vehicle, the special effects become obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenes where the RV runs off the highway, then back on again, take forever. The scenes where Grandpa is trapped on the RV roof as it careens down a dirt road takes forever. Mom\&#39;s conversations with the mummy take forever. Matt\&#39;s out of body experiences take forever. This film takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to hit the fast forward button at least a dozen times. As scenes dragged on, it was obvious Flocker was padding. Cut the fat here, and this would have clocked in at an hour. The final &#34;explanation,&#34; that the mummies\&#39; spirits were trying to kill those close to Matt never holds water. Did they inhabit the RV? The film maker never brings up the fact that the spirits are no good at their murderous ways, they never kill anybody!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I kept thinking of Nelson in &#34;Airplane!,&#34; I also thought of other movies. Anything to keep me from falling asleep during this one. Boston is terrible as the kid, playing a fifteen year old as a cute ten year old who has a smart alecky line for all these adults who fall over themselves loving him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, Flocker has written and directed a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise in making the audience feel ill at ease. This is not scary, and like the ghosts, you too can still walk...away from this tape at the video store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is unrated, and contains some physical violence and mild profanity.&#39;,
   &#39;Let me just say I loved the original Boogeyman. Sure, it\&#39;s a flawed clichéd 80s horror movie, but hey those types are fun to watch! And plus it gave us something a bit different. So I gladly bought it and to my surprise this movie came along with it (only copy they had actually) so I thought &#34;Eh, what the hell&#34; and bought it. Mistake #1. So that night I felt in the mood to watch a movie (I actually bought tons that day) and figured this was the shortest out of all the ones I bought so I\&#39;ll just watch this and hit the sack. Mistake #2. Yes, I have heard how bad it was but I was willing to take a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a few minutes into the movie and there\&#39;s the first flashback. I think nothing of it at first. Then the new footage with the prediction of the chick in the bathtub and I\&#39;m kinda liking the direction it\&#39;s going in. Then the next flashback which is a bit longer and I\&#39;m sitting there thinking &#34;Yes I\&#39;ve seen the first Boogeyman! I know what happens so move along!&#34; Then the next one comes up and I figure screw it and fast forward through it. Then the final one (Maybe I fast forwarded through the explanation but why was she lying topless on the mirror? At least she could\&#39;ve shown them!) and I decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over! WTF? What happened to the prediction stuff? What happened to the long hair dude (Did he tap that or what?)? And more importantly what kind of weed was the writer and director smoking when making this awful POS??!!! And what was the point? Was Annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie? Or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this? The latter could make sense because the stabbing of Pantyhose Face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later. Wait a minute, no it wouldn\&#39;t! Because Lacey (who the movie questionably renamed Nancy! Is Uli too dumb to remember his movie characters\&#39; names?) would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10! Did she get around during middle school? And also why would Pantyhose be after Annie? What connection does she even have with the characters of the original movie? And a BIG HUGE MOVIE MISTAKE I found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his notebook does anyone notice that he\&#39;s just SCRIBBLING? Wow, how professional, Doc! So, what is the explanation for all of the questions I asked above? IT\&#39;S A POINTLESS MOVIE WITH NO THOUGHT PUT INTO IT AT ALL! I will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that\&#39;s it (Maybe a couple of extra features, any Special Edition of it yet?). Then I will return this DVD and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven\&#39;t seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore! Please let that be so! Sorry this review is so long. I\&#39;m just angry at this movie I had to vent somehow&#39;,
   &#34;If this is all the Watchowski&#39;s have to offer in terms of a back story to the Matrix, than I really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level. The second renaissance, while visually stunning &amp; beautiful is, story-wise cliched &amp; ludicrous. How many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology, humans all-too eager to make war, humans basically destroying themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the plot of the second renaissance, doesn&#39;t that make the machines the good guys?! The machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters. They fight back, win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans, who reject them in favor of all-out war, which the cleverer machines naturally win. If this is the back-story, then we shouldn&#39;t be rooting for Neo, we should be rooting for the machines! The humans were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate. Since I do not believe that the Watchowski&#39;s intend for us to favor the machines over the humans, I have to believe that the Second Renaissance was simply a misguided attempt @ creating a back-story.&#34;,
   &#34;This star-studded British/Spanish co-production looks great, what you can see of it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly cropped, so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other. Few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one, as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once, neglecting the middle. Another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrating, and that&#39;s it. We never find out why Shaw has become a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas) although I suspect he was called home to star in Kojak, as his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old English music hall tradition to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some lyrics I&#39;ve never heard before. On the plus side, the location is great, a huge old ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs leading nowhere, some nice scenery-chewing by Robert Shaw, and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri, and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I didn&#39;t really like this film, but I haven&#39;t exactly seen it. I will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then.&#34;,
   &#34;You can give JMS and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still sub-par. Dont get me wrong, B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever, but if i was an exec seeing this movie, i wouldnt have ordered the series. I dont like O&#39;Hare as an actor, the costumes are silly, and there are tons of cliches. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle. If you are a B5 fan and havent seen this movie, see it. If you arent a B5 fan, dont...you wont want to watch the series.&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;m not to keen on The Pallbearer, it&#39;s not too bad, but just very slow at the times. As the movie goes on, it gets a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he&#39;s good here. I&#39;m not a massive Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but I don&#39;t mind her sometimes and she&#39;s okay here. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it.&#34;,
   &#39;Dumb is as dumb does, in this thoroughly uninteresting, supposed black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an uninspired version of &#34;The Three Amigos&#34;, only without any laughs. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which &#34;Play Dead&#34; is not. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which &#34;Play Dead&#34; is. What &#34;Play Dead&#34; really is, is a town full of nut jobs. Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton\&#39;s character from &#34;A Simple Plan&#34;, while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK&#39;,
   &#39;Adrianne, should really get a life-without Mr. &#34;Brady&#34;. She nauseates me, and has been one of the main reasons why I know longer tune in to the show. It\&#39;s pretty brainless show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death. This makes them look/sound they are anything but ready for marriage, and yet, I know these disagreements are all part of life. I guess to some people this is entertainment. If this happens to fall into next season I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash. Though I would not be terribly surprised. can\&#39;t even stand the commercials for this show anymore! I hope they\&#39;re getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week. However, the &#34;A&#34; girl has one heck of great butt!&#39;,
   &#39;I have not seen this movie in ages but figured I\&#39;d comment on it anyway, mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens, 3) Was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison, the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot Alec Baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife, Kim Basinger. McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the Baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who\&#39;s stupid idea it was to make this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s just get it said and out of the way -- Alec Baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on Baldwin\&#39;s part to presume to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. Like someone else points out, Peckinpah\&#39;s 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action/adventure heist genre. By contrast Baldwin, Bassinger &amp; company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only Michael Madsen\&#39;s and James Woods\&#39; slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. One viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn\&#39;t have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. Peckinpah\&#39;s movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing. There\&#39;s no artistic urgency to it\&#39;s existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don\&#39;t know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor/actress, which in itself isn\&#39;t a really good thing. I\&#39;d always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie &amp; fall flat with something original. This movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it\&#39;s revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it\&#39;s release Mr. Baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood. Thank god for &#34;Team America&#34; for putting him in his place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/10&#39;,
   &#39;I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago, and said to myself, &#34;Seems funny, plus it has Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!&#34; I proceeded to pay $15.99 plus tax for it. I took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted. Wooden performances abound. All the &#34;hilarious&#34; and &#34;outstanding&#34; performances promised never seemed to arrive. After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame, knowing that I could never get that 90 minutes or $15.99 back. I literally almost cried as well, because if that was what could be considered &#34;comedy&#34; I didn\&#39;t want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was. Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he didn\&#39;t want to watch it alone. This was my next horrible mistake, because as I watched I just became angry. I began to yell at the movie, and I\&#39;m not one to talk to movies period. Everyone I know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they\&#39;ve ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but that could not save this movie even. The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding. The fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.&#39;,
   &#39;This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. That is no exaggeration: you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely thought Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does Erwin/Elvira suicides at the end, but instead of this, in every scene somebody is trying to explain: &#34;when he was young, this happened...&#34; and &#34;he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there...&#34;, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon in the movie, Erwin/Elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute (certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat), and while telling her the story of Elvira\&#39;s life, Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other. It is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying. Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of &#34;I have suffered much in my life, and am about to die&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of the sparse moments where actually happens something, Erwin/Elvira encounters a former lover, that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys (as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality) is that he recognizes Elvira.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some interesting shots and ideas, I must admit (such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin), but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinder\&#39;s self- indulgence.&#39;,
   &#39;I am marking this as a &#34;spoiler&#34; only because of some of my comments of the show\&#39;s content, not to the content itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I read the comments it is apparent that those Republicans somehow tolerate the show, but disdain it, while the Democrats seems to relish in its so called truthfulness. One reader even (so it seems) actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when Bush was in grade school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as to the content as I see it, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must actually be really Bush haters. In the Episode that I saw last, s02e03, it showed that the program must have been put together long before McCain became the front runner for the nomination; because, the other former front runners are all featured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that caught my attention, was the use of add in closets. I thought that the series must have been made in Europe of for sure not in the U.S.A., because I know of no home the U.S.A. that does not have built in closets, and most likely in the homes of the artists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I watch the show, yes I do get caught up in it, I am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our President. Sure there are problems as most American will agree, but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world. Perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network, so that IF Obama or Hillary got in, would they continue to produce and air the same sort of &#34;humor&#34; about them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one more comment on a commentator\&#39;s remarks. IF there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000, according to that writer, he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. As far as 911 events, I do believe that it was set in motion back when Clinton was president, and I can\&#39;t see how if Gore was president anything would be much different.&#39;,
   &#34;It was 9:30 PM last night at my friend&#39;s camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 PM and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing, Father of the Pride. I&#39;ll start by saying that I have only watched to episodes. The first time I watched it, I found it unfunny and crude for nothing, so I thought &#39;&#39;Holy sh*t, I have a football game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons&#39;&#39;. But yesterday, I tried to give Father of the Pride a second chance. I find that it&#39;s a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is I wonder why it got it&#39;s TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons a lot more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons is also a lot more violent (Halloween specials) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, well I&#39;ve got news for him: Shrek 2 was way better and I think he stayed too much in the family thematic. However, I must admit that Father of the Pride did make me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#39;t mind Father of the Pride. I don&#39;t hate it, but I don&#39;t like either. I&#39;ve seen way better from &#39;&#39;The Simpsons&#39;&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5/10&#34;,
   &#39;For starters and for the record, the term &#34;Necromancy&#34; describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does NOT, in any way, relate to having sex with cadavers. That is called necrophilia and, yes, I know it\&#39;s an obvious difference but I\&#39;m already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that I sport a perverted taste in movies! This movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy, in fact, and merely just qualifies as boring, inept and terribly bad. &#34;Necromancy&#34; makes at least one top five ranking, namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made! Now, director Bert I. Gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces (on his repertoire there are titles like &#34;Earth vs. the Spider&#34;, &#34;King Dinosaur&#34; and &#34;Food of the Gods&#34;) but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless, redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns. Shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead, Lori and her husband Frank move to the quiet little town of Lillith, where Frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory. Lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity, especially with the town\&#39;s patriarch and &#34;owner&#34; Mr. Cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious. That\&#39;s another thing. How can anybody &#34;own&#34; a town and everybody in it? Either way, Lori gradually discovers that everybody in Lillith is a witch and Mr. Cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead. Since many years already, Cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he\&#39;s prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes. I honestly don\&#39;t see the point of the whole movie. It\&#39;s a blatant rip-off of &#34;Rosemary\&#39;s Baby&#34; \x96 one of the alternate titles even is &#34;Rosemary\&#39;s Disciples&#34; \x96 but the script is muddled and imbecilic beyond belief. Why isn\&#39;t anyone allowed to have children for as long as Cato\&#39;s son remains dead? That\&#39;s just really selfish! When, where and how did Lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead? &#34;Necromancy&#34; definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments, but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget. The grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy. Orson Welles\&#39; performance \x96 undoubtedly the low point of his career \x96 is pitiable, and still it\&#39;s the best aspect about the entire movie.&#39;,
   &#34;Robert Wagner is the evil boss of Digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;so you&#39;re saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system&#39; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;i&#39;m having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;but it&#39;s not going after software, it&#39;s killing people&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;watch out for the &#39;i&#39;m into virology&#39; love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard&#34;,
   &#34;Wes Craven, you are having a laugh... at our expense. The Red Eye plot is preposterous... We are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent 8 weeks watching a girl, who then turns up at an airport behind her, flirts and chats her up successfully, somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space, not trapped in the middle of a five seat row (contacts at check-in?) and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up. Then, once up in the air, in a confined space, surrounded by strangers, he immediately starts threatening the vacuous, if super-efficient, Rachel McAdams and saying tosh like &#39;we got ya daddy, do what I say, or poppa gets it&#39;. Well, forgive me, but didn&#39;t they already have her daddy ready for slaughter-so-you-better-oughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore wouldn&#39;t it have been oh, sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere, forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot, pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important &#39;call&#39; required? Or even - cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists - keep the dumb dad-in-distress thing intact if you must, but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense, without the plane dumbdown? Alternatively, without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terrorist/assassin - couldn&#39;t the massive bazooka-missile thang employed have been far more easily used on, say, a car driving down the highway, with the politician inside, rather than the 50th story of a Miami seafront hotel, from a fishing boat (mind you, as we already know, security in Miami is lax, so they&#39;ll speed away)? I know, I know, far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for 8 weeks, burgle her dads house to steal his wallet (that somehow - star trek style - gets transported from Miami to Texas instantly) in order to - perhaps - get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and, and, and... Well, a thousand things could go wrong here, each one entirely destroying the Big Plan, so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful, such as - 1. bazooka. 2. car. 3. boom! My 50 minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid cod-Hitchcockian twists, which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience. And as for security back at Miami Airport... we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane, chased by cops, who during the chase sits down to have a coffee, moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar, then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal... by now also chased by crazed Cillian Murphy (no CCTV then? - I had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for 10 seconds at Miami Airport a couple of years back). So instead of speaking to the cops - her allies - or getting on the blower at a call-box direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger, McAdams prefers instead to steal a People Carrier off a family in the Airport forecourt (call the damned security...) and drives home to daddy, mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house, in a rich neighbourhood-watch district, crushing the front porch in the process - an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze, after about a minute, yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who aren&#39;t even mildly curious, thus ensuring 15 more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast Hollodeck type house... Dohhh, it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all - Cillian (surely renamed Silly &#39;un for doing this one?) preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged (and inept) lunatic killer at the end, this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked. I&#39;d better stop, because the stream of drivel I&#39;m writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the Red Eye script. If Ms McAdams hadn&#39;t been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered, from &#39;Red Eye&#39; to &#39;No Eye, Dear&#39;. RR&#34;,
   &#34;Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out an exciting fact from this film: someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule! And guess what, they really would like to be doing something else (the viewer has similar feelings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, when I was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film, I found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#39;t usually watch that much late night TV, so I can&#39;t recommend this film, unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life.&#34;,
   &#39;Whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family. The movie is filled with idiots and includes live &#34;teabagging&#34;. That should sum it all up for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time. You may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on - it doesn\&#39;t!&#39;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t see much reason to get into this movie in much detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of &#34;A Season in Hell&#34;, recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps, and return without engaging the enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fat chance. What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in, take pics, and sneak out? Who would come to see the movie? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s essentially a celebration of Stallone\&#39;s muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bulging. (They are oiled and bulging throughout.) There is the ritual strapping on of black leather, ugly guns, and even uglier knives. The black guns are cleaned, assembled with loud clacks, and almost as oiled as Stallone\&#39;s muscles. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy\&#39;s forehead. The knife is sharpened with slick snicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington, cynical politicians who, you can bet, were never even in a fist fight in grammar school. No guts, you know? Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie does what it set out to do, but what it set out to do is meretricious. It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese. The bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Free Our MIAs.) Why would they keep them? It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force -- in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor. Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States -- a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a captive, Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese. Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists, his muscles still on display. Then, not content with subhuman Vietnamese, a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer -- &#34;Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember.&#34; A high-tech type, the Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just pig dump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until &#34;this country loves us as much as we love it,&#34; bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed, which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions. The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group. At least Rambo\&#39;s aimless drifting left room open for a sequel, which arrived apace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless. It marches dully through it\&#39;s phantasmal ideological swamp, killing without mercy, barely speaking, barely able to speak. To speak is a sign of weakness.&#39;,
   &#39;As a &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; fan I was excited when this movie came out. &#34;At last,&#34; I thought, &#34;someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author.&#34; Wrong!!! If the casting director was intending to cast a &#34;Jane&#34; who was plain he certainly succeeded. However, surely he could have found one who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere? Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why was the plot changed at the end? One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book. What a disappointment&#39;,
   &#39;It was almost worth sitting through this entire god-awful &#34;film&#34; just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as this again. Acting - 0, script - 0, fight scenes - 0, male lead - 0 (cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is gorgeous and not a terrible actress). This is the criteria I used to average it out to a two. I lost count but I believe ever movie cliché, ever, is in this movie. When the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her, from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement. Plus he just shows up for no reason. He was never even mentioned before. I don\&#39;t know what else to say here. Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple years. At least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials.&#39;,
   &#34;My Score for this crap: 1 / 10 1 for the technical only. Everything else is very bad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another film that makes no sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#39;s easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We must believe that taking people for morons. Perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are crap. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to listen to this s**t, press super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).&#34;,
   &#39;Although I recently put this on my 10 worst films list, I have to say it\&#39;s probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in &#34;The Maddening&#34; or any of the &#34;Look Who\&#39;s Talking&#34; sequels. Still, it\&#39;s pretty nauseating, even with sexy Drew Barrymore playing something of a horror-movie answer to Holly Golightly, relocating from New York City to Los Angeles but finding out she\&#39;s being stalked by a murderous look-alike. Poor Sally Kellerman, a quirky actress of great acclaim in the \&#39;70s, is reduced here to a paltry supporting role, and Barrymore\&#39;s leading man George Newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor, always pausing for a laugh after every line. The picture is swill, but Drew\&#39;s bloody shower scene boasts showmanship, and the identity of the psycho (although right out of a &#34;Scooby Doo&#34; episode) is interesting. But as for the finale...get real! Who had to clean up THAT mess? * from ****&#39;,
   &#34;For Daniel Auteuil, `Queen Margot&#39; was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, `Paris, Texas&#39; was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges (`CrissCross&#39; and `A World Apart&#39; cannot even be compared with this one), and Goran Bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from `Queen Margot&#39; for this movie (Attention to the end of the film). If this was an American pop movie, I would not feel surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and director, a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple-minded and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people. There are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone. And finally, there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys. Every character is shown in simple black and white terms: the good versus the evil. Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie. I think this movie was not disturbing, but very disappointing.&#34;,
   &#39;..Oh wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions, like &#34;continuity editing&#34; and &#34;geographic match&#34;. I couldn\&#39;t tell where I was in this movie. One second they\&#39;re in the present, next minute their supposedly in the 70\&#39;s driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80\&#39;s style clothing. I think. I couldn\&#39;t pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you\&#39;re a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this film is for you. It\&#39;s home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, though, just skip this one.&#39;,
   &#34;Like last year, I didn&#39;t manage to sit through the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging. Or rather, out of all the total bores packed into the theatre, he at least wasn&#39;t in the Top 10 Most Boring. A lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10. I hadn&#39;t known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman\x85if there&#39;s no director, she&#39;s gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Boring Speeches was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For helping me write this review I&#39;d like to thank my Mum, my Dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me, and I&#39;d like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I haven&#39;t been starving myself for a month. I&#39;m not going to cry...thank you.&#34;,
   &#39;For the life of me I can\&#39;t figure out why anyone would make a movie like this. The plot is tired, the acting is strained, the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the &#34;F&#34; word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so \&#39;let\&#39;s throw in another couple of &#34;F\&#39;s&#34; for good measure, that\&#39;s what the American public wants to hear\&#39;. Gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part. Forget this c__p, rent \&#39;Shrek&#34; and have a good laugh.&#39;,
   &#39;I so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it went completely the other way - let\&#39;s be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with little to show for it. I bet One Small Seed went nuts for this. I know SL did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off. Even Danny K had better timing. I\&#39;m actually being serious. Every time they introduced a bit character I kept thinking, &#34;Darn, this person should have been the lead!&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independent doesn\&#39;t mean that the camera work needs to be horrible. Black and white did nothing for this movie - actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief. The black and white also wasn\&#39;t crisp. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. Strangely enough I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb - maybe that\&#39;s why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Corne (who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything) was speaking to this movie and not David - see it and you\&#39;ll understand. I bet the guys who organise Oppikoppi were dismayed. One would think nothing happens there at all. I got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone\&#39;s back garden. I know regular guys who have much funnier, raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these &#34;comics&#34;. The dude who they hooked up with end was OK though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess SA comedy\&#39;s gonna stay in the stone age a little longer. Nice work guys.&#39;,
   &#39;Johnathan Frakes is a good actor and, when he\&#39;s not directing a family film, a fine director. But, he really shouldn\&#39;t have directed this movie, and the screenplay should\&#39;ve been rejected. The director and writers must understand what the original TV show was really about, as well as who the characters were and how they worked. The original series had many episodes with razor-sharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that American producers would never consider using in children\&#39;s programming, much less a movie, which made the original series so well received by adults. I mean, the Tracys were college graduates and some of them did even drank alcohol and smoked tobacco! And, there were characters who did get killed, although most were bad guys. If they had written it the way that it was originally done, which isn\&#39;t dumbing things down with poor dialogue, kindergarten humor, and a weak plot, this Universal/Studio Canal joint venture wouldn\&#39;t have such bad reviews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This motion picture is almost pure blasphemy. If you\&#39;ve seen the original Supermarionation series, then you\&#39;ll know what I\&#39;m talking about! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that was out of place and annoying were the constant references to Ford Motor Company, even going so far that Lady Penelope was riding around in a disfigured Ford Thunderbird made up to look like FAB-1 instead of using what would\&#39;ve been more appropriate considering Ms. Penelope\&#39;s station (not to mention being more faithful to the original), a ROLLS-ROYCE FAB-1. She\&#39;s supposed to be a distinguished member of British society, hence the preference for England\&#39;s finest make of motorcars in the original series. One other reviewer here indicated that Penelope wouldn\&#39;t be caught dead in a Ford. He\&#39;s pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a Ford doesn\&#39;t work. At least they could have had Penelope ride in a Jaguar made up like FAB 1 since Jaguar is a British car make that is owned by Ford, but NO! They had to use a straight FORD! But the Ford product placement doesn\&#39;t end there. EVERY single car you may see is a Ford! Even the news flash that is shown on the TV sets in the movie were sponsored by Ford! Ford, Ford, FORD! The predominance of Ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for Ford. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original series had a design that was futuristic for the 1960s and still remains ahead of its time even today. But, the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and functional. This kind of treatment didn\&#39;t exist in the movie, where everything is stylized to excess, defeating the sense of functionality and practicality. A lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style, many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets, bringing them to life in the episodes. The brilliant and lively music score by Barry Gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story, the characters, and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective (a little bit of Stanislavski talk). The movie, on the other hand, had some overly grating performances. Anthony Edwards overplayed Brains to a fault, Bill Paxton as Jeff Tracy just didn\&#39;t work despite decent acting (one of few), there were better choices for the Hood than Ben Kingsley, and many others that I don\&#39;t care to mention (it would take too long). Quite simply, the puppets were more believable! Second was the overly generic and underwhelming music score by Hans Zimmer, sounding more like a mix between &#34;Days of Thunder&#34; and &#34;Apollo 13.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, the Hood. The Hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with Kyrano through a statue of Kyrano as an outlet for ESP contact. But, that was where his extraordinary capability ended. He\&#39;s a master of disguise and deception, which allows him to sneak around undetected (for the most part, anyways) to gather information of the Thunderbirds vehicles for his own means. He also uses weapons for his own defense, including pistols, and generally collects information using a film camera, although he tried to steal Thudnerbirds 1 and 2 in the 1960s United Artists release of &#34;Thunderbird 6&#34; (which was the last Thunderbirds show filmed in Supermarionation and was the second Thunderbirds theatrical release). But, while he is a nemesis of International Rescue, the Hood isn\&#39;t the villain in every Thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with International Rescue. In the movie, he\&#39;s obviously the main villain, but he and his cohorts seem to act more like morons, along with the Hood having extended mind control ability, including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time. This totally deviates from the Hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more criticisms, but the 1000 word limit for IMDb reviews will not allow me to list all of them. So, I will close with the point being made that I didn\&#39;t enjoy this movie. As a matter of fact, I think it sucks! Having seen the original series and Supermarionation movies (Thunderbirds Are Go, Thunderbird 6), I was hoping for something a lot better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Supermarionation was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce. (And that\&#39;s saying it nicely.) - Kip Wells&#39;,
   &#39;Okay, let me coin a new word here: polyphobia: The fear of polyamorous relationships. This is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome, only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution. Only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark my words: a few decades from now, polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux-pas as homophobia, but guess who was too close-minded to realize this? Right the first time: the producers of this movie. And so many like it. Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned type of movie like this? Priding itself on being limitlessly open-minded about gayness, it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy, which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a disappointing, run-of-the-mill chick-flick. (But, damn, I gotta say, Heather Graham is the cutest thing alive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 10.&#39;,
   &#34;John Pressman (Micheal &#39;I shoulda called Ditech&#39; Lerner) works at a doctor&#39;s office as an orderly. His mother (Zelda &#39;Poltergeist&#39; Rubenstein) hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him. But this turns out to be a movie within a movie, but the lines soon blur as John goes a movie theater to kill. Prompting a guy who&#39;s watching the movie to do the same. Lerner is suitably over the top in this, but Zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again. That gets annoying fast. But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie.As a horror film this one fails, it&#39;s too busy trying to be clever, trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of slasher: An art-house one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D+&#34;,
   &#39;I rented this on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a &#34;character study&#34; type of movie, so I struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the Stop button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with a character study theme, I just could not get into this film at all. Perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but setting that aside, I tried my best to move on to finish watching, but gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest. About the only interesting thing was the sergeant\&#39;s gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one, and spray painted it black to appear as police issue. I think this movie should have been entitled, &#34;Who Stole the Sergeant\&#39;s Gun?&#34; Scenes were well done but putting them together I once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn\&#39;t finish watching it I\&#39;d say there is some merit to renting this film ... maybe. To me, it was a waste of good viewing effort and time. I\&#39;ll leave it up to you to try it, but it\&#39;s not one I\&#39;d strongly recommend.&#39;,
   &#34;This was the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane in. I understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers, who did pretty good for newbies, but over all, the movie was not believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of the gunfire, you would think the police would have intervened. Even the coin being a bug on Sean was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug, was not realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like this movie was slapped together fast. Poor job. Get a better writer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The count down to the end was not in sync with anything. It took longer to fight. And what a coincidence that each time Billy was going to blast Sean, he&#39;d be out of bullets. Once, I can believe, but not twice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, Billy&#39;s character was goofy. It was so stupid when Sean punches him out at the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!&#34;,
   &#39;Kill Me Later&#34; has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair) on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to &#34;kill her later.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual execution of this premise, however, falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion. Shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around. Lack of character depth especially diminishes Selma Blair\&#39;s performance, whose character Shawn vacillates from being morose to acting &#34;cool&#34; and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt. This is unfortunate, as under other circumstances Ms. Blair is an appealing and capable actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compounding matters for the worse is director Dana Lustig\&#39;s insistence on using rapid cuts, incongruous special effects (e.g. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end), and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the MTV crowd. Certainly Ms. Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction, but in no way does her skill help overcome the film\&#39;s inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end. Clearly, Lustig has a distinct visual style; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The producers (Ram Bergman &amp; Lustig)can be commended for their ability to realize this film: they were able to scare up $1.5 million to finance the film, secure a good cast, and get domestic and foreign distribution. This is no small feat for an independent film. Yet given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. He first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by. His brother then infects the other gang members.In some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense. The acting is mediocre but the story doesn&#39;t help the film. The makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies. The budget for this film I&#39;m sure was very limited. I believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget. If you wan&#39;t to see a good zombie flick don&#39;t see this one.&#34;,
   &#34;I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some &#39;afternoon delight&#39; time I&#39;d be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d&#39;Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. In short it does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments.&#34;,
   &#39;Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and it stars Rick Hill, who is some kind of body builder and famous of that, if I have understood right? The plot follows as Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something back from the evil lord, and he has to travel to the lord\&#39;s cave. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien, and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off of huge success of Conan, and even though this is very stupid film, it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no many cinematic merits in this film. Couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker concentrates to show, are nude females and huge muscles of Hill. Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid, too, so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists! The fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull, and the monsters are not either anything special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done, but what did you expect from low budget effort like this? This tries to be as great as Conan but fails pretty miserably. As I said, this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else. This belongs to the category it\&#39;s so bad it\&#39;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be, and as a turkey film, I appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys, enjoyable ones of course! If bad films are your cup of tea, then try this and have fun, but if you don\&#39;t understand &#34;enjoyably bad films&#34; then stay away. And if somebody can\&#39;t stand large amount of nudity, then stay away as well. There is more nudity here than violence, and due to these scenes, the film has an R rating. Otherwise this could be some safe PG family film!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10&#39;,
   &#39;This was a less than exciting short film I saw between features on Turner Classic Movies recently. While the film popped out due to its very intense Technicolor, the film itself just wasn\&#39;t that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy--like this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience WASN\&#39;T even a consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated--such as when the characters talked to her, they usually said &#34;Clara Barton&#34; instead of &#34;ma\&#39;am&#34;, &#34;Miss Barton&#34; or &#34;Clara&#34;. Plus, one sickly confederate soldier said that he was a &#34;Johnny Reb, A Confederate a Rebel,...&#34;--almost like he was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls. This was just sloppy writing--period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, &#34;Perry White&#34; on the SUPERMAN TV show) in a beard as President Garfield. Yep--it\&#39;s him under that beard.&#39;,
   &#34;This movie fails miserably on every level. I have an idea, let&#39;s take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east. Maybe if we&#39;re lucky they&#39;ll all be shot and killed and we won&#39;t have to ever have our time wasted by them again. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life? My god, I can&#39;t think of anything I&#39;ve ever seen that was this bad. I&#39;d rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film. If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film, I&#39;ll spit in their face and then beat them senseless. That&#39;s my two cents.&#34;,
   &#34;Sure it takes place in the west, but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western. Instead, it is a movie of a woman sheriff. Make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. She becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down; she is only a tad bit upset by this. Her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Utterly stupid, as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I guess because she liked him she wouldn&#39;t do it. The killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb. This movie is very boring and not really worth watching...it is not one of the better episodes of MST3000 they made. I can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful. Corman is a low budget director, but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another.&#34;,
   &#39;Wow. Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately, but this one especially is begging for a beatdown. Let\&#39;s start at the beginning. First, writer-director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role, complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence. Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite. Montford\&#39;s pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night, Della is furious that somebody double-parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year. She decides to do something about it, so she leaves a nasty note on the car\&#39;s windshield. The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall. When she finally gets to her car, the thugs confront her about the note, a cop is killed, and she runs, and they catch up to her, and she gets away, and they chase her some more, and on and on. Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving. The thugs are not scary or menacing at all, and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine. Why the bad guys don\&#39;t just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me. And once, just once, in a film like this, does the leader of the pack have to die last? What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept? Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming &#34;Della!!!&#34; And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della, exhausted and hurt, cries out to the heavens, &#34;Where are you, God?&#34; Where, indeed, was god when this movie was being made? I give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting, and it\&#39;s not as bad as \&#39;BTK Killer,\&#39; the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film. Cheers!&#39;,
   &#34;Good actors and good performances can&#39;t mask a pointless script, bad dialogue, and patterns of behavior spiraling into nothing you&#39;d care about. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No character development - no growth, no interest, just some suffering for no particular reason, teaching us nothing and not even bothering to entertain.&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;m a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn&#39;t going to go anywhere. Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it&#39;s also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a &#39;rogue&#39;; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That&#39;s basically all the plot that this movie has. The film does have a real &#39;seventies style&#39; to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn&#39;t come across very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she&#39;s definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t have much else to offer.&#34;,
   &#34;A yawn-inducing, snail-paced disappointment, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money. When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender \x96 his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intents of her own, sent to recover an item from the bank owner&#39;s safety deposit box that is stored within the bank, and you have quite the three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, all you get it set-up in the film, and nothing pays off in the end. Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless, cutthroat villain of sorts. Clive Owen isn&#39;t given much to do besides brood and pose, but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It&#39;s strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this film. The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man, however, is how much unwarranted praise it has received. For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre-summer blockbuster, this one falls horribly flat.&#34;,
   &#39;You will recognize the plot immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to get Mom and Dad back together again. Yes, that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here\&#39;s the spooky thing. Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than the 21 year old Hayley Mills while playing the doting daughter(s) roles, Durbin looks much older, as in adult. And so do all of her so-called siblings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film. So you\&#39;re constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start &#34;hitting on&#34; them you get the feeling as if they\&#39;re pedophiles, and you might be one, too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out. Teens or temptresses, little girls or little foxes, you are never quite sure what you\&#39;re supposed to be thinking of them as.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parents, too, seem very old and the whole film seems very dated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a rusty version of the Parent Trap and you should avoid it, or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you don\&#39;t believe me.&#39;,
   &#39;From the Star of &#34;MITCHELL&#34;, From the director of &#34;Joysticks&#34; and &#34;Angel\&#39;s Revenge&#34;!!! These are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie. And the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true!!! Ugghhh... Joe Don Baker eats every other five minutes in this film. It\&#39;s like a bad remake of &#34;Coogan\&#39;s Bluff&#34;&#39;,
   &#39;One scene demonstrates the mentality of &#34;Terminator Woman&#34; pretty well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain\&#39;s camp. Karen runs across an armed guard, who points his gun at her, but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, picks up the gun and runs away! Then again, when a film is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know you shouldn\&#39;t expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble do get some amusing banter going early on, and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they get separated, and the film slows to a crawl, and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up, it lacks excitement. The finale has Trimble fighting Qissi inside a cave and Sheperd going womano-a-womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat, but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value. On the positive side, kudos to the costuming department for giving Karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film! (*1/2)&#39;,
   &#39;***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** If one were to review the film based on the premise alone, one might think that you were looking at an average animal orientated horror flick. The plot is as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing. (I live in South Africa so it was released as &#34;Blood Surf.&#34;) Admittedly, this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which, if it were explored further, could have improved the movie somewhat. However, this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salt-water crocodile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film, no one seems to give a damn. The most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature. Another thing that really irritates about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself. They introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another 10 minutes to a mercifully short film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting can be said to be mediocre. It probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from. All in all there isn\&#39;t one person who made a terrible impact on me. Every single person seemed to be a watered-down caricature and in this way, not one of these actors made any sort of impact on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crocodile itself is said to be huge, over 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film. The crocodile\&#39;s death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes one\&#39;s stomach turn. With a huge cry of bravado, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckily-placed spike at the bottom of this said hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be. What probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low-budgetness which all served to create a truly awful movie.&#39;,
   &#39;- Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films of the 50s. I understand that none of it is to be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of it works. A parody should be funny and this one just isn\&#39;t. Not once during the entire runtime did I so much as crack a smile. In general, I am easily entertained, but I couldn\&#39;t find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I knew I was in trouble right from the beginning. The two &#34;stars&#34; make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they can\&#39;t control that gets them both wet. These two come off as Bowery Boys wannabes. Why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the Bowery Boys is beyond me. After the less than illustrious beginning, the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other assorted unfunny bits. It\&#39;s all just a complete waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I bought this on the double feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. That movie is Academy Award winning stuff in comparison with Invasion of the Star Creatures.&#39;,
   &#39;This is the worst adaption of a classic story I have ever seen. They needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs rarely move along the story. They seem to be thrown in at random. The flying scene with Marley is pointless and ludicrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not only one of the worst movies I\&#39;ve seen, but it is definitely the worst musical I\&#39;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s probably only considered a classic because &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; is such a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic doesn\&#39;t mean that some cheap adaption is.&#39;,
   &#34;The movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the Novel. If you want to see the movie then don&#39;t read the novel first as it will shock you. However, cinematography was OK and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores Africa then go for it. Acting performances are adequate, however, many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.&#34;,
   &#39;I am a great fan of the Batman comics and I became disappointed when I could no longer find Batman: The Animated Series on TV anymore. I was excited to learn that there was going to be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I watched the first episode the day it premiered and I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the animation is very poor. It looks like a cheap, crappy Japanese anime. Then again, just about every modern-day cartoon is like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The character designs are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk, the Penguin is a Kung-Fu master, Mr. Freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head, and the Riddler is a Gothic Marilyn Manson look-alike (which is funny because I don\&#39;t expect people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be Gothic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst character design is that of the Joker. They turned him into a monkey/demented Bob Marley/Kung-Fu fighter! The Joker is supposed to be Batman\&#39;s deadliest enemy, but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless. In one episode his plan was to put his Joker venom in dog food! Oh, how evil! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents, which is why he fights crime. This version of Batman doesn\&#39;t seem haunted by his parents\&#39; deaths and is not interesting at all. He\&#39;s also not a detective, just a fighter. If there\&#39;s an enemy he can\&#39;t defeat, he won\&#39;t study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would, he\&#39;ll just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them. A lot of times this show doesn\&#39;t even feel like a Batman show, just another brainless anime that\&#39;s nothing but pointless fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains. They\&#39;ve taken away everything that makes them likable and relatable and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In the comics, he\&#39;s a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. When experimenting on himself, he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature. In this show, he\&#39;s a mad scientist who wants to purposely transform himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason. Just about all the villains are like that; none of them, with the exception of about one or two, have an actual motive for their crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode &#34;Heart of Ice&#34;, which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic, three-dimensional, and likable villain. The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin. Even that crappy movie Batman &amp; Robin used it as his origin. In this show, he\&#39;s a petty jewel thief before becoming Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He\&#39;s STILL a petty jewel thief! Great origin. No wonder they used it over the one Dini created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Batman fan, I don\&#39;t dislike this show just because it isn\&#39;t like the comics because I also liked BTAS, the Batman cartoons that came after it, Tim Burton\&#39;s Batman films, and obviously, the superb Christopher Nolan Batman films. None of them were 100% loyal to the comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not that it\&#39;s not exactly like the comics or BTAS, it\&#39;s that it lacks any sort of depth that makes other Batman media so popular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve given this show so many chances, but the more I watch, the more I find that disappoints me. I miss the good old days back when Batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy.&#39;,
   &#34;When I was younger, I liked this show, but now...BLECCH!!! This show is sappy, badly written, and rarely funny. The three leads were all good actors and funny men (Saget&#39;s stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with, as was Coulier a better stand up, and Stamos was a better than average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff (who could blame him?). The show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The catch phrases- How many times can one person put up with tiring catch phrases like with &#39;how rude&#39;, &#39;you got it dude&#39;, &#39;nerdbomber&#39;, &#39;cut it out&#39; and &#39;have mercy&#39; in a 24 hour time period? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Kimmy Gibler- the most annoying character ever written for television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The writing- stale and cliched as an oreo cookie. There is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing. Full House had bad cliched writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Three men living together in San Francisco- Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Unrealistic stuff- Too much to recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Trendy kids- The girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved since I think many of them are talented in their own right. But this show was just so sugary sweet, I couldn&#39;t stand it after a while.&#34;,
   &#34;This movie had a good story, but was brought down because it didn&#39;t have enough horror film elements and violence. It was like watching a live action cartoon. It would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played seeds for where the series was going.&#34;,
   &#39;Despite much style, flash, and glitter, this French musical fails to speak. The tunes are repetitive, predictable, and tedious. The story is uninteresting, as are the many characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People break into song and dance, without motivation or reason. Most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly studio bound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so negative an effect it had on me. Certainly a shame, to have such a multi-talented cast in so feeble a final effort. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes to show, I guess, where followups (in this case, to the great classic, &#34;Umbrellas&#34;) often do go awry. One cannot recapture, only recreate.&#39;,
   &#34;I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you&#39;ll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was Philip Glass&#39;s soundtrack. I couldn&#39;t - and still can&#39;t - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a big waste of time! My advice: Forget commercialism! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again instead!&#34;,
   &#39;I saw and liked the first two a lot, really. Especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first. And it\&#39;s a story standing alone. You don\&#39;t have to know the first movie. I liked that in the &#34;Free Willy&#34; movies, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But... the third, here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half an hour. The movie is okay, there are funny parts in it alright. But what for? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is: a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already, plus telling the story from their point of view. But what for? I\&#39;d really like to know. You know, the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one, is really nice. But what comes after is mostly unnecessary. I guess many people liked Timon and Pumba, and so do I really. Yet, for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny. No chance, most of it wasn\&#39;t funny at all, at least for me. Btw. what was the movie about anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? I tend to choose option b and I\&#39;m very disappointed about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to see stories like: &#34;the story behind xy&#34;, you should see &#34;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&#34; by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. That\&#39;s really funny and no try to get more out of &#34;Hamlet&#34; then it has.&#39;,
   &#34;I didn&#39;t mind the film that much, but it was incredibly dull and boring. A few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You should give it a go if you like silly, stupid humour because this is the film for you.&#34;,
   &#34;An expedition led by hunky Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to an earlier expedition. They meet beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. They soon find themselves faced with a blood drinking mummy...and only Simira seems to know what&#39;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real snoozer. I caught this on late night TV when I was about 10. It put me to sleep! Seeing it again all these years later I can see why. It&#39;s slow-moving, the mummy doesn&#39;t even show up until 40 minutes in (and this is only 66 minutes long!), the acting ranges from bad (Dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neise) and there&#39;s no violence or blood to be found. This movie concentrates more on second rate dramatics (involving a silly love triangle) than horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rates three stars because it actually looks pretty good, everyone plays it straight, there&#39;s some good acting from Diane Brewster, it&#39;s short and the mummy attack scenes (all three of them) aren&#39;t bad. They&#39;re not scary just mildly creepy. Still, this movie is pretty bad. A sure fire cure for insomnia.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Don\&#39;t bother to watch this film&#34; would be better advice, if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a huge disappointment considering the great cast, not just Marilyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was just nothing, certainly nothing like described on the VHS box, of course. There simply was no suspense, precious little excitement and too many dull spots, most of them trying to show why &#34;Nellie&#34; (Monroe) was so messed up. This was not a good role for Monroe, even though I didn\&#39;t need to see this character to know she could act. &#34;Some Like It Hot&#34; alone was good enough evidence for me. But this role just didn\&#39;t fit her and it\&#39;s no surprise it wasn\&#39;t one of her more popular films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: it\&#39;s not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.&#39;,
   &#39;I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son. He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and I did. The writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention at all. The movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that I was hoping my son would fall asleep so I could pick him up and walk out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to say that the film isn\&#39;t an interesting concept, it\&#39;s just told so oddly, (bad screenplay?) especially when we &#34;meet the family&#34; for the first time. I know we\&#39;re supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord, they could\&#39;ve shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, I didn\&#39;t actually time it). By that point I was scratching my head looking for an exit.&#39;,
   &#34;At first, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters. I loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film. It was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained. The novel - in the first place! - wasn&#39;t meant to focus on an adventure! That&#39;s only the surroundings. In the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat! Additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious! They screwed it up! ... I&#39;ll never watch it again!&#34;,
   &#34;The movie started off strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from the Practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake, I would choose the former. Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would have thought he would put on a better show, given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. Everything he did in this film was unconvincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films. Even hardcore N&#39;Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside there are a few plot holes, such as Pollack&#39;s sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery. This movie had so much promise. Thoroughly disappointing.&#34;,
   &#39;&#34;Jason Priestly stars as \&#39;Breakfast\&#39;, a psychotic jewelry store thief whose grip on reality is frighteningly precarious, according to the DVD sleeve, &#34;With his accomplice \&#39;Panda\&#39; (Bernie Coulson), the duo make off with a carload of cash, a result of a tip-off from beautiful cashier \&#39;Ziggy\&#39; (Laura Harris). Her reward: to hitch a ride with the out-of-control duo so that she can meet her long-lost father Francis (Stephen McHattie). But he\&#39;s on a suicidal quest to even a score with his former boss (Louis Gossett, Jr.) and has the cops hot on his trail. Rage, murder and revenge are about to collide!&#34; Stay out of their way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** The Highwayman (4/28/00) Keoni Waxman ~ Jason Priestly, Laura Harris, Stephen McHattie&#39;,
   &#39;With no affinity towards any type of filmmaking, and a healthy appreciation of documentaries, I can honestly say I was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of &#34;20 Dates&#34;. I won\&#39;t waste your time with the plot, you may read other reviews. I will say though that Berkowitz\&#39;s hyper, Woody Allen-style narration was extremely annoying. You either wished he\&#39;d lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. And it\&#39;s potentially apparent to Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary. Forgive me for disguising insults as compliments, but I\&#39;ll give credit to Berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of ****. I appreciate the boundaries &amp; intentions of the film here, but even when regarding the standards Berkowitz sets for himself, he fires off and misses on all levels. In closing, I\&#39;m sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy wanna-be filmmaker, and therefore I question the film\&#39;s sense of authenticity. Hey Myles, I loved your film the first time I saw it... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a film directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.&#39;,
   &#34;I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin. Being a devout fan of Lewis Carroll&#39;s &#39;Alice&#39; books I was very excited about this movie&#39;s premier, which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch. Normally I&#39;m enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well. Usually it&#39;s interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story. Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the original&#39;s characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying. It probably didn&#39;t help that the actors weren&#39;t very good either. Most performances were ridiculously over the top, which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film. All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by. Really, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman&#39;s work. Also, I&#39;d have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful. It was with out a doubt the low point of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a joke. Don&#39;t see this movie. After its conclusion I was genuinely angry.&#34;,
   &#39;No real plot to this one, just a series of short skits acting out some VERY old jokes. I chuckled once or twice in the beginning, much to my chagrin. But even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it\&#39;s welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious (with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake). Still as bad as this movie is (and that\&#39;s pretty putrid), it\&#39;s a comedic gem compared to pretty much ANYthing by Aaron Seltzer &amp; Jason Friedberg (Date movie, Epic movie, Meet the Spartans) Also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: 11 pair of tits, 3 bushes, 3 asses &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Code Red DVD Extras: Original trailer for this film; and trailers for &#34;Beyond the Door&#34;, &#34;Dead Pit&#34;, &#34;the Farmer&#34;, &#34;obsessed Ones&#34;, &#34;Power Play&#34;, &#34;Sole Survivor&#34;, &amp; &#34;Wacky Taxi&#34;&#39;,
   &#34;This movie is unbelievably ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is the worst one I&#39;ve ever seen. I am a huge fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie aren&#39;t shown. It just shows us the already dead bodies, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible. The graphics look so obviously fake. The actors are awful as well. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of sh*t movie, but I had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it. If I could rate this a -10, I would. F*ck this movie. It&#39;s crap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t watch it.&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this film at a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the film\&#39;s producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the audience wasn\&#39;t scared, it seems the filmmakers were. They delayed release for over a year. Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they\&#39;d re-cut it; as far as I can tell, they hadn\&#39;t. It was the same lousy movie, just a year older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost qualifies as &#34;so bad, it\&#39;s good,&#34; but it\&#39;s slow-paced and boring.&#39;,
   &#39;I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead I watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family. And this went on and on. If Mr. McElwee\&#39;s family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee\&#39;s family began it tobacco business ; I expected more than McEwee\&#39;s continual focus on his family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the state\&#39;s economy by tighter regulation of tobacco. The countless references to the movie &#34;Bright Leaves&#34; are out of place - So what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee\&#39;s great grandfather? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film? I didn\&#39;t.&#39;,
   &#34;Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don&#39;t provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it&#39;s obviously a style of film that Americans haven&#39;t really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about, but DON&#39;T say I didn&#39;t warn you...&#34;,
   &#34;I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be warned, the following will not only give away the plot, but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the &#39;electrical system&#39; of your body. What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin will turn white of the calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This virus is very intelligent. When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage, which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert&#39;s head. The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc&#39;s in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh dear...&#34;,
   &#39;This film is probably pro-Muslimization. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I write that? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. In the end of the film he seemingly is a Muslim because of his head-wear, that he has kept his amulet, and his general clothing. He has a six year old child, who wears the same head-wear and therefore is probably a Muslim, although the mother is a Christian. The main character thus chooses to, it seems, to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. No one of the other male main characters, which are Christians, seems to breed a child. There are more Muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it, it therefore seems.&#39;,
   &#39;There are similarities between Ray Lawrence\&#39;s &#34;Jindabyne&#34; and his last movie &#34;Lantana&#34; \x96 a dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. But whereas &#34;Lantana&#34; offered some hope and resolution, &#34;Jindabyne&#34; leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline - the aftermath of a fisherman\&#39;s discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river - is based on a short story by Raymond Carver. It became an element in Robert Altman\&#39;s classic 1993 ensemble &#34;Short Cuts&#34;. Lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small Australian community under stress. The movie poses some moral questions &#34;Would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend?&#34; and more poignantly for Australians &#34;Would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal?&#34; The acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike &#34;Picnic at Hanging Rock&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be prepared for a let down, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning, thereby eliminating the element of mystery. And so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale.&#39;,
   &#39;I still can\&#39;t believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap.This movie is worse than &#34;Deadly Friend&#34;.The plot is stupid,the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull.I don\&#39;t know why Wes Craven hates his debut &#34;Last House on the Left&#34;-an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes(probably)this turkey.Don\&#39;t get me wrong,I really like some of his movies,but it was a real torture sitting and watching this.&#39;,
   &#34;You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: The Safety Pin Killer! That&#39;s right, in Killer Workout, a dumb slasher movie if I&#39;ve ever seen one, the unseen murderer dispatches his (or her?) victims with an oversized, novelty safety pin. It is an odd choice to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Naturally, the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title suggests, an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect. In fact, the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer, just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed. And since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead, it&#39;s really just process of elimination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, while the entire name cast is killed off, the aerobics classes continue in earnest. In fact, nothing is capable of stopping the dancing. While three men are murdered in the next room, the workout goes on. Death isn&#39;t even a factor; one character dies, but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when named the movie Killer Workout and not Logical Workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cop chases, explosive tanning beds, and hundreds of shots of women&#39;s exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure. Much like the woman caught in the tanning bed, I felt very uncomfortable by the end of Killer Workout. Finally, thankfully, THE END flashed on the screen. What happened next? You got it, shots of the women working out. Not even the end of the movie can stop them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#34;A memorable line from a short lived show. After viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarter back said FOOTBALL and the rest of the squad responded YOU BET! A fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show. Using this line added a unique element to our season that I&#39;ll never forget. We had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line. The show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi intramural flag football squad at West Virginia Tech.&#34;,
   &#34;This film was positively the worst film I have ever watched. I couldn&#39;t sit through the whole thing. I also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping... I mean what was that all about! I cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have #ingwasted a £4 rental fee. The quality both picture and sound are terrible, the acting... well doesn&#39;t exist . It was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh....... AVOID AT ALL COST! The girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they&#39;d be willing to take their tops off... While these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn&#39;t make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was like (possibly worse) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car?! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definatey not one to buy folks. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money like I have.&#34;,
   &#39;I saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go. This movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve, who has visions of his in-pending danger. He meets up with a woman named Christine when giving a lecture at a local book club, and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. To put it plainer, Reve likes the Dutch sausage. So Reve concocts a plan to seduce Christine\&#39;s boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him. But its later discovered that Christine has had 3 previous husbands, who she all murdered. Now Reve and Christine\&#39;s boyfriend could be &#34;THE 4TH MAN.&#34; The storyline makes sense with no plot holes. The editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine. The movie is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, this isn\&#39;t my cup of tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie opens with Reve getting out of bed in JUST a t-shirt. So in the very beginning, you get to see Reve\&#39;s lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state. Later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors, and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues. Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Plus there\&#39;s a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I have anything against &#34;shocking&#34; scenes, but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking. The whole movie is revolved around the shock value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if any of this is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far far far far far away from this one. My mind is still scarred.&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;ve seen my share of Woody Allen&#39;s movies, and while they&#39;re not always great, you can usually be sure you&#39;re going to be entertained. Probably the last really good ones were Bullets Over Broadway (&#39;94) and Mighty Aphrodite (&#39;95) - since then the ones I&#39;ve seen have been patchy but watchable. And so when I was invited to see the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, which I wasn&#39;t even aware had been released yet, I went along happily. I hadn&#39;t really heard much about it so I hoped I would be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I&#39;ve seen. The premise is over-explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out, I assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t mind the concept behind this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film proceeds to show us that, by playing out both scenarios. The problem is neither of these &#39;two films&#39; are any good at all. The comedy isn&#39;t funny and the tragedy isn&#39;t very tragic. It seems like Allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam, or time, to actually complete the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general level of acting is notably bad also - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table, and it&#39;s basically a Woody Allen impression. Previously good actors like Chloe Sevigny just come off as annoying, and the worst of the bunch is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame, because her character is in nearly every scene!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair to the actors, the script they are working with is lacking if not non-existent. Definitely a long way from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.&#34;,
   &#34;I&#39;m sorry but I didn&#39;t like this doc very much. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who made it obviously don&#39;t have much imagination. The interviews aren&#39;t very interesting and no real insight is offered. The footage isn&#39;t assembled in a very informative way, either. It&#39;s too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. One thing I&#39;ll say is that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets. All considered, this only gets a &#39;4.&#39;&#34;,
   &#34;This Hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale. A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence. However, out of no where, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything--and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life! What an odd, silly and preachy film! Personally, I&#39;d like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The production values are relatively poor compared to later productions--a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting.&#34;,
   &#34;This has got to be the cheesiest, stupidest, most retarded monster film of all time. It&#39;s a complete joke that this even surfaced into theaters. This is sort of like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. The people involved in this moronic pile of trash need to be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I&#39;m giving them too much credit. I&#39;m sure they were lobotomized before the filming. How else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains. Don&#39;t waste a minute of your life watching this. Don&#39;t even waste your time sending a review.&#34;,
   &#34;This is one of the worst movies I saw! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap. Don&#39;t waste your time watching this. Good actors, but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues. Hope there&#39;ll be no Blanche 2 :-) Avoid this movie by all means!&#34;,
   &#34;Good grief! While I still maintain that Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins came awfully close. This...this...thing insults the audience at every opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k, this one was a struggle to get through. I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. This thing managed to embarrass me - alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are a die-hard MST3K fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment, think twice about seeing this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s that bad.&#34;,
   &#39;To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this: Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up, followed by another two-and-half-minute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand -- striking a Christ-like pose -- behind the closing credits. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra\&#39;s distinctive visage dead center, filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or think about this: The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars, yet, while Streisand\&#39;s songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar Kris Kristofferson isn\&#39;t allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Nor, though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties, do they actually sing a duet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or consider this: Streisand\&#39;s name appears in the credits at least six times, including taking credit for &#34;musical concepts&#34; and her wardrobe (from her closet) -- and she also allegedly wanted, but failed to get co-directing credit as well. One of her credits was as executive producer, with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser, Jon Peters. As such, Streisand controlled the final cut of the film, which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. What it doesn\&#39;t explain is how come, given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good, their efforts only make Streisand look bad. Even though this was one of Streisand\&#39;s greatest box office hits, it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sex-drugs-and-rock\&#39;n\&#39;roll, Streisand plays Esther Hoffman, a pop singer on the road to stardom, who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristofferson\&#39;s John Norman Howard, a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Has-beenville. In the previous incarnations of the story, &#34;Norman Maine&#34; sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer &#34;Vicky Lester&#34; achieve her success. In the feminist seventies, Streisand &amp; Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man, so the trajectory is skewed; she\&#39;ll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; he\&#39;s a burden she must endure in the name of love. As such, there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher, but almost ruthless, while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance, and oddly it serves his aimless, listless character well. Streisand, on the other hand, exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems, if not too rehearsed, at least too controlled. Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. The two have no chemistry, making the central love affair totally unbelievable. You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence, though at age 34, Streisand doesn\&#39;t seem particularly young or naive. The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. And, indeed, had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way, to make Streisand\&#39;s character openly play an exploitive villain, the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim; they don\&#39;t seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the film\&#39;s strong points: note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos. And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman, yet the filmmakers have changed the character\&#39;s name of the previous films from &#34;Esther Blodgett&#34; so that Streisand won\&#39;t be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive. So much for ethnic pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film\&#39;s release is near legendary, so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie, with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the film did serve its purpose, producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes (including the Oscar-winning &#34;Evergreen&#34; by Paul Williams and Streisand). But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she didn\&#39;t want it to be, a vanity project.&#39;,
   &#39;This movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects. There are some interesting visuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, it\&#39;s typical nineties/aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance. True to the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not worth picking apart the story. That\&#39;s like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There\&#39;s not much there to begin with. It\&#39;s nothing original and not very special. So don\&#39;t go in for the story at all. Just look at the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As has been mentioned, it got a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of great FX treatment of an invisible (and at times half invisible) man. However if you ignore the &#34;standard&#34; pyrotechnics, it\&#39;s a sight to behold (or not to behold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it\&#39;s a decent FX film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone.&#39;,
   &#34;I&#39;m a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80&#39;s is bland as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all very average. It&#39;s a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80&#39;s - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, please don&#39;t waste your time watching this unless you love 80&#39;s movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life&#39;s too short to watch crappy movies.&#34;,
   &#34;&#39;Say Yes&#39; is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, but it never does. It&#39;s the kind of &#39;motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple&#39; crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue is clunky and, in several places, poorly translated. The acting is uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond all belief. The &#39;heroes&#39; don&#39;t think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The &#39;heroine&#39; twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. The villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. The villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries. And don&#39;t even get me started on that terrible &#39;twist&#39; ending. Sheesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus point in this film, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy &#39;The Hitcher&#39; and &#39;Spoorloos&#39;, but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved.&#34;,
   &#39;OK, it\&#39;s very rare that I complain something I got for FREE. So I guess this movie pushed me over that limit. I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for FREE and walked away very very disappointed. One audience member\&#39;s question to the director about using the Native American references just as &#34;bookends&#34; instead of being weaved into the movie better, basically says everything that this movie FAILED on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NATIVE American REFERENCES--- The Native American references felt really out of place and contrived. It\&#39;s obvious that this director and writer tried tackling an arena they never played in before. They should have stuck to the old adage of &#34;write about something you know&#34;. IF they are in fact versed in this it certainly did not show on the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clichés and ON THE NOSE--- I agreed to see this film on the basis that it was an indie. So I held it to higher expectations. &#34;Little Miss Sunshine&#34; was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. Before it even came out to wide release I was already raving how it\&#39;s going to be a hit. UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same about &#34;Expiration Date&#34;. &#34;Sunshine&#34; took us to cliché incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a &#34;cliche&#34;. This movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already TRAPPED from the start. The psycho mom\&#39;s antics, the Hendrix couple, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say it, but the best and WORST movie I\&#39;ve seen this year were both indies. &#34;Little Miss Sunshine&#34; being the best and this movie being the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn out from their family members at the cemetery.&#39;,
   &#39;because you can put it on fast forward and watch the inane story, without having to listen to banal dialogue, and be finished in 10 minutes max. Come to think of it, even 10 minutes is too much to waste on Enid-Blyton-meets-struggling-wanna-be-artists. Vomit.&#39;,
   &#34;Why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it? They ask why Hollywood isn&#39;t making the money it used to. Because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good IL&#39; boys come out on top. It wasn&#39;t Gone with the Wind but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can&#39;t come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $$$$. I only hope that this movie makes 10x&#39;s less than it cost to make. The only one&#39;s to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the General Lee. The audience is the victim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t see it, watch the reruns of the TV show instead. They still hold up 20 years later.&#34;,
   &#39;I really wish i could give this a negative vote, because i think i just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film. the acting was just god awful, i mean REALLLYYYY bad, the dialog was worse, the script sounded like it was written by.... i can\&#39;t think of anything horrible enough to say. And the day &#34;outside&#34; and the night &#34;inside&#34; shots make you think the events took over several days. Terribly acted, directed, written, etc etc. all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS. If my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed, it is to tell the world to not watch this crap. This movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.&#39;,
   &#39;Sure, this one isn\&#39;t really a blockbuster, nor does it target such a position. &#34;Dieter&#34; is the first name of a quite popular German musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about. It is based on the autobiography &#34;Dieter Bohlen&#34; wrote a few years ago but isn\&#39;t meant to be accurate on that. The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content (at least for American standard) which is either amusing (not for the other &#34;actors&#34; of course) or dumb - it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a &#34;Bohlen&#34;-Fan or not. Technically speaking there isn\&#39;t much to criticize. Speaking of me I find this movie to be an OK-movie.&#39;,
   &#39;You should know that I am the type of person that watches even the worst of movies to the finish, often out of sheer morbid curiosity. I even watched Leprechaun to the end before giving in to the temptation of tearing out my eyes and stamping on them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before I made a frantic leap for the stop button and dashed back the rental store just to put as much distance between me and it as possible.&#39;,
   &#34;Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it&#39;s ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well, croons so effectively, and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy. In his more cutesy moments (with the girl in the train station, in the final number with Rosie), I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off him he was so repellent. You keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie. By the way, if you see a production of the stage musical, the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie, you&#39;ll see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;,
   &#39;Didn\&#39;t care for the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** this was my first visit to your site...just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a dummy, but I think I\&#39;ll still submit my comments. and yes, British Columbia is lovely ***Or why they took it from its South Carolina Coastal setting?(this question stands) The place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie. Oh, I just read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here\&#39;s my other main issue with the film. Kim Bassinger was too vapid and not at all what I pictured from the book. I know, the book was the book and the movie; well not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathetic. Also the book evoked rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the &#34;castle&#34; in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters.&#39;,
   &#39;Rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie &#34;Our Gang&#34; release schedule, &#34;A Tough Winter&#34; features two storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a wintry day, decide to make some taffy. Little Wheezer relays the directions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor/handyman of the Gang, and his interactions with the Gang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;A Tough Winter,&#34; to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a shifty, sly, and slow-moving character. &#34;Our Gang&#34; producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a &#34;skilled comic&#34; and used this &#34;Our Gang&#34; entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit\&#39;s characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been shelved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are some funny moments both with Fetchit and the taffy, &#34;A Tough Winter&#34; is a plodding and meandering effort. If one positive came out of this film, it was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 &#34;Our Gang&#34; films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 10.&#39;,
   &#34;Just a warning... This is the worst movie I have seen in years... I couldn&#39;t watch it to the end... It is a pure waste of time... I really feel sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie. There really is not much to say about it. Horrible acting, incredibly bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn&#39;t be. Just to tell you one scene: the police are searching for Snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting around inside the building, but still they are whispering so that Snipes doesn&#39;t suspect a thing.&#34;,
   &#39;Many days after seeing Conceiving Ada, I am still in awe that any group of people would spend so much time to make such an atrocious film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one ought see this film in hopes of learning anything of consequence about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her endeavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, no one ought to see this film in hopes of being entertained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sci-fi film, this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure. Somehow, the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on her personal computer--with the advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary. I doubt anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep this from seeming absolutely absurd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a drama film, this would unquestionably be a horrendous failure. Somehow, the writer/director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama over essentially nothing. I doubt that anyone could feel that all the drama in the film serves only as an irritating distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for Conceiving Ada. The circumstances under which I saw it forbid me from leaving the theater but there is no question that I would have otherwise. I am still angry that I wasted the time that it took to see it. Only that I might more effectively criticize this movie, I wish that I were more articulate.&#39;,
   &#34;If another Hitler ever arises, it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film, which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start. Far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land, sane people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would have died in a ditch, nameless and unknown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who reads the accounts of Hitler&#39;s close companions - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for instance - will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made, when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches. Ditto the overstated anti-Semitism, which was neither a central plank of the early Nazis - who were primarily anti-communist - nor uncommon or unusual for the times. The film makes it look as though Hitler&#39;s sole ambition from the start was the Holocaust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions, you can ignore fleck-lipped ravers life the one portrayed here. Look instead for a charming, charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation, and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. I&#39;m afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama&#39;s than Fred Phelps&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped for much here, and got nothing but caricature. The fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of &#39;Reefer Madness&#39;.&#34;,
   &#34;I saw this film recently in a film festival. It&#39;s the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clichés, taking the &#39;social&#39; theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very much like a &#39;high-standing&#39; woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira&#39;s previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door. I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films, specially one that is made to please everybody.&#34;,
   &#34;Dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. To much. Calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. I didn&#39;t quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars. Just because there both up on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I&#39;m sure Rodney Dangerfield was really into that when he was alive. He had a few good jokes like the Burger King joke where people yell at the drive thru. I also liked the Reese&#39;s Pieces joke. If Dane just didn&#39;t act so mental he might be funnier and I might have given this a higher rating, as high as maybe an eight.&#34;,
   &#39;I don\&#39;t remember &#34;Barnaby Jones&#34; being no more than a very bland, standard detective show in which, as per any Quinn Martin show, Act I was the murder, Act II was the lead character figuring out the murder, Act III was the plot twist (another character murdered), Act IV was the resolution and the Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) asking her father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do remember was the late, great composer Jerry Goldsmith\&#39;s excellent theme song. Strangely, the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air. I will also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett despite Ebsen being badly miscast. I just wished the show was more entertaining than when I first remembered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their Archive of American Television channel. Let\&#39;s just say that I was more kind than Goldsmith about the show &#34;Barnaby Jones.&#34;&#39;,
   &#39;I had VERY low expectations for this alleged &#34;re-imagining&#34; of the original -- and they weren\&#39;t even met! What were they thinking? (Answer: They weren\&#39;t.) Please don\&#39;t waste your time on this Hollywood trash fest. Clip your nails, balance your checkbook, do anything besides watch this. Remember: If you rent stuff like this, it will only ensure they make more.&#39;,
   &#39;I\&#39;m a big fan of movies that make you think. I\&#39;m still thinking long and hard about this one, fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled. What\&#39;s really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body, made extra-tacky by being filmed on cheap video. This happens three times and I was certain it would be explained in the end. I put my trust in the film-makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified. It was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie has to be the most apathetic I\&#39;ve come across in the genre. The sets look like a cross between a 1970s Dr Who set and someone\&#39;s ill-formed idea of a sponge-painted living room. The lighting is unimaginative (if your sets are going to be that bad, at least film them in semi-darkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance). Of the abducted quartet, the girl stands out as being particularly lame, but none of them is given a personality. The aliens\&#39; plans for world domination are just plain silly - all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved. Most of the movie consists of people running down corridors. Yes, it really is that exciting. The &#34;ray gun&#34; special effect is ... curious, to say the least (what use is a weapon that takes a 15-second concentrated blast to kill, and even then the guy comes back for more?). The script is like a bad episode of The A-Team, and the ladies\&#39; hairstyles come from the same era, so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders. When we finally get to see what the aliens really look like, they\&#39;re in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes. The resolution of the story - traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home - is truly the sign of a writer who\&#39;s never had an idea more complex than a Saturday morning cartoon (I mean the bad ones with no plot, action, or characterization) in his or her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, what is with the naked chick?! Was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the DVD cover to boost sales?&#39;,
   &#34;The only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son Paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take the Lord&#39;s name in vain in this film being from a Presbyterian background? It doesn&#39;t fit. I wished Paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly, smirkish, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to rescue but doesn&#39;t-so what. It&#39;s very uninteresting. We see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by Paul because of his native American girl. That was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real &#39;wild western&#39;. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister&#39;s sons have nothing to do but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies. I&#39;d rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never.&#34;,
   &#39;This film was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film looks (and is) definitely cheap, the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all -she was even pretty- and they thought they needed something more impressive; they failed here too (the make up is awful even for the late 50\&#39;s, rather funny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green\&#39;s career as such and also as a writer never materialized; he was really bad at both. Same goes to the actors, leading and supporting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Brain That Wouldn\&#39;t Die&#34;\&#39;s best achievement is its short running time.&#39;,
   &#39;I could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd, but I decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe *something* would happen. This is the work of a writer/producer/director/special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie. That\&#39;s what he wanted, anyway. What it turns out to be is a lot of acting, either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river waters (oh, and what luck, a woman just happens to be naked in it... even though there have already been DISAPPEARANCES!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just nonsensical stuff, but I suppose it\&#39;s not too harmful; it\&#39;s not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi-interesting peek at Brazilian &#34;culture&#34; (which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of \&#39;hey, this is NOT America!\&#39;). But whatever hope the director had in casting Mitchum or Carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog. It doesn\&#39;t help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the &#34;action&#34; happens, it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal. Usually I would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished- in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s- but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it\&#39;s called... nah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to get the Elvira DVD double-feature of this (bad print with bad transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, make sure to skip this one. Unless, of course, you\&#39;re an Elvira die-hard and can\&#39;t help yourself to hear her luscious commentary; personally, I\&#39;d rather get Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots from Mystery Science Theater on this roast turkey.&#39;,
   &#34;(aka: DEMONS III)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films. It was supposed to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. It drips what looks like green paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the husband doesn&#39;t believe any of this. The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf&#39;s head attached to it and it&#39;s attracted to the scent of orchids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The films isn&#39;t really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring. There&#39;s no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family&#39;s Jeep Cherokee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective, with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film, a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected. Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this wasn&#39;t a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases. This is pretty standard stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;,
   &#39;Assassin Hauser\&#39;s (John Cusak) mission is to whack a Mid-Eastern oil minister, whose name happens to be Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the country of Turaqistan which is run by American interests. Hauser poses as Trade Show producer to allow him to get to Omar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying. Here it does too much: the government, politics, music, war, people not generally accepted by society, and did I mention &#34;war.&#34; And, that is what we have here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life. I am still asking myself why I continued with the DVD. Also, there are so many Cusak family members in this that John Cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there, or is that just me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to be that a John Cusak movie, while a little offbeat, was, in the end, rather good. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess. Make of that what you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun-fire, bombings, and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point? Probably. It just takes too long to set up the hit, which is largely forgotten until the last 15-minutes. In the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast. And, chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I don\&#39;t think so, but you know: the boy \x96 girl thing \x85\x85and they needed something to take up more time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, for what they were supposed to be, (offbeat and annoying) the performances of Duff, and Kingsley were good. But, when I saw Dan Aykroyd\&#39;s character, in the beginning of the show, sitting on a toilet taking a dump, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well. I was not wrong. I am sure some will sing praises of this effort, but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so, too, is a mess\x85\x85\x85\x85\x85&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now remember why I continued with the DVD. I was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself. Never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.&#39;,
   &#34;I never quite understood the popularity of Saban&#39;s Power Rangers show which was quite simply a second rate Americanized version of Japan&#39;s ultra popular super sentai series of the past three decades! What was cool about the Japanese version gets completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m sure if they spoke Japanese, they would learn how much better super sentai is over the American version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power Rangers is completely awful, try Super Sentai instead! Looking for a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension instead!&#34;,
   &#39;There are only two movies I would give a 1/10 to, this stinker and &#34;The Man who Fell to Earth.&#34; I remember seeing Protocol at a theater in the early 80s when I was in high school. The script is insulting to anyone (including a high school student\&#39;s) intelligence. It completely lost me with the &#34;hillarious&#34; gag of someone getting shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn\&#39;s. I could not stand to see another movie she was in until IMO she redeemed herself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing. The worst.&#39;,
   &#34;Oh, it&#39;s the movie - I thought I waited too long to take out the dog... I can&#39;t believe I watched the whole thing. I guess I was optimistically anticipating that it was going to get better. Horribly disjointed dialog, pathetic acting, and totally improbable events. Like Toby&#39;s mom hanging herself in the time it takes Col to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a 24&#39; ceiling and no chairs, counters or anything around her motionlessly suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in. The little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the puppy of the first couple was a close second. The basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick, but this version sadly is not it. I get more scared when I open my electric bill every month.&#34;,
   &#34;being a NI supporter, it&#39;s hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are hard to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a predictable &#39;poetic justice&#39; ending makes this an awkward watch...&#34;,
   &#39;I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn\&#39;t even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil\&#39; knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I\&#39;d call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw &#34;Semi-Pro&#34; that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol\&#39; days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn\&#39;t even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there\&#39;s no more movies to remake??? Where will horror go next???&#39;,
   &#39;Adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they\&#39;re two different mediums . Do you think it\&#39;s a great idea to make ZULU into a stage play ? Imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping &#34; Blimey there\&#39;s thousands of them out there &#34; Great movie and a bad stage play &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order for a stage play to make great cinema there\&#39;s two essentials needed &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) A fine cast that creates on screen chemistry &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 ) Great dialogue &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . The story revolves around a hit-man played by Palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by Cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . I was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can\&#39;t decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . Since the story is very static it\&#39;s of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give FAITHFUL a miss and watch 12 ANGRY MEN instead&#39;,
   &#34;As a veteran of many, many pretentious French films I thought I&#39;d taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything. But not this. Pointless, relentless, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.&#34;,
   &#34;It&#39;s a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and, yes, it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial contortions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throwing in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad.&#34;,
   &#39;This is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I\&#39;d heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word &#34; plot &#34; is used because as far as I can see there is no plot as such . There\&#39;s something involving Russian gangsters , a character called Pete Thompson who\&#39;s trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant , and an Irish bloke called Sean . How they all fit into something called a &#34; plot &#34; I\&#39;m not sure . It\&#39;s difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie films but if you watch any of his films I\&#39;m sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing . Likewise a James Bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes . You will have a serious problem believing RANCID ALUMINIUM has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you\&#39;ll be watching . Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she\&#39;s doing nothing to become inconsistent . Steven Berkoff gives acting a bad name ( and he plays a character called Kant which sums up the wit of this movie ) while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it\&#39;s utterly forgettable . I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now I\&#39;ve mainly forgotten why . But this doesn\&#39;t alter the fact that I remember disliking this piece of crap immensely&#39;,
   &#39;This sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk. The first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. Most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it\&#39;s really a &#34;chick flick&#34; and little else. This probably plays on the Lifetime network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a quick murder scene and then more talk. By halfway through, they had lost me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years old in here.&#39;,
   &#39;Just think, it cost a total of $250,000 to make &#34;Clerks&#34;. How the hell did they spend $45 Million to make this glorified music video? A practically unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see... I know, it must have been spent on that expertly crafted, economical, tension filled screenplay. Shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer wouldn\&#39;t be caught dead producing anything for less. I\&#39;m just surprised he didn\&#39;t blow up anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it wasn\&#39;t an awful film I guess. The female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $5 Million without any loss to the production, and 6 more $5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well.&#39;,
   &#39;I didnt think it was possible, but i have found film worse than \&#39;Body Melt\&#39;. This film is really really bad! And what makes it worse is that its another Australian film...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot on what looks like VHS, and with a terrible 80\&#39;s rock soundtrack, it just keep getting worse and worse, which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is (skinned male hanging up-side-down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why do their accents keep changing? From bad New York drawl, to prissy english, then pure Aussie! And it happens to the whole cast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover (i believe it was the Utah Film Festival). This has to be a lie because no-one in their right mind would nominate this for anything (perhaps the Golden Rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on guys! This film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100!!! It has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done to the &#34;film&#34; makers of this trash, for proving there is a reason not to see films..... 0/10&#39;,
   &#39;Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies? Those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While &#34;Hollywood Homicide&#34; is by no means terrible, it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie. It\&#39;s a comedy that\&#39;s not particularly funny, and an action movie that\&#39;s not especially exciting. An overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects, and he is able to carry the film most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford aren\&#39;t exactly Newman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, &#34;Hollywood Homicide&#34; is a reasonably amusing diversion, but just barely. Take out Ford, and it\&#39;s not even that.&#39;,
   &#39;Amy Heckerling\&#39;s second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930\&#39;s gangster films made in the Warner Brothers\&#39; tradition. Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. Keaton\&#39;s mother (Maureen Stapleton) has continuing health problems, so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yeah that\&#39;s right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton\&#39;s younger brother turned district attorney, Glynnis O\&#39;Connor his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton\&#39;s moll. The film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. Piscopo does the &#34;once&#34; bit one time too many. Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties\&#39; actual 1939 release date. *1/2 of 4 stars.&#39;,
   &#39;Although Misty Ayers (burlesque stripper) is certainly attractive as the blonde lead, this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times (no nudity in 1954 when this film was made; not 1965).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles Bud Abbott of Abbott &amp; Costello. Most of the other woman are unattractive, and the drunken woman is semi-amusing in a creepy way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayers has a curvacious physique, but you can\&#39;t judge any acting talent because the ENTIRE film is post-dubbed. Some of these &#34;exploitation films&#34;, usually made later than this one, are interesting in some way, but this is really a bore fest. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY) directed. There are some Samurai-like facial expressions and interesting apartments, but there\&#39;s really NOTHING here.&#39;,
   &#39;Geez, as a Gay man who lives in NYC I can gratefully say that I have never seen the underbelly of Gay Culture that is portrayed in this film - and I am glad of it!!! Was this film broadcast on TV across the United States there would be a great anti-Gay backlash and I cannot say that I would blame them. The people in this film do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trandgender American, what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare. The inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-White) are blatant and unsettling - society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film\&#39;s &#34;cast&#34; - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation, but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one\&#39;s self.&#39;,
   &#39;The main problem with the documentary &#34;Czech Dream&#34; is that isn\&#39;t really saying what it thinks it\&#39;s saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an audacious - I hesitate to use the word &#34;inspired&#34; - act of street theater, Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda, two student filmmakers from the Czech Republic, pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie: they deliberately fabricated a phony &#34;hypermarket&#34; (the Eastern European equivalent of Costco or Wal Mart Super Store), built an entire ad campaign around it - replete with billboards, radio and TV spots, an official logo, a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise - and then waited around to see just how many &#34;dopes&#34; would show up to their creation on opening day. They even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might well ask, &#34;Why do such a thing?&#34; Well, that\&#39;s a very good question, but the answer the filmmakers provide isn\&#39;t all that satisfying a one. Essentially, we\&#39;re told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something - even something that\&#39;s not true - simply through the power of advertising. And the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the &#34;real&#34; (i.e. higher) purpose for the charade is to convince the Czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the European Union. Fair enough - especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers, all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of &#34;research&#34; into what does and does not work in advertising. In a way, by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments, these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, in many ways, the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target, it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it. For it is THEY THEMSELVES and NOT the good-hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here, as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people, some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot. And what is all this supposed to prove anyway? That people are &#34;greedy&#34; because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains? Or that they\&#39;re stupid and gullible because they don\&#39;t suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised? Such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I\&#39;m afraid this smart-alecky, nasty little &#34;stunt&#34; only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots. And, indeed many of them, when they finally discover the trick that\&#39;s been played on them, react with a graciousness and good humor I\&#39;m not sure I would be able to muster were I to find myself in their position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m not saying that the movie isn\&#39;t gripping - something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action - but, when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red-faced and empty-handed to their homes, we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed.&#39;,
   &#39;What can I say? I\&#39;m a secret fan of \&#39;over the top\&#39; action and horror films. Especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo, but I\&#39;m not a fan of Snake on a Plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three potential draws to this film: \x95 The comedy of the situation; \x95 The horror; and \x95 The novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this film isn\&#39;t written as a tongue-in-cheek horror or a comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where you\&#39;ll smile to yourself. If you want to get the feel of the film, the trailer genuinely represents the movie, a horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, if you\&#39;re expecting a film full of action and shocks, you won\&#39;t be disappointed. It doesn\&#39;t stand out above other movies, but it always keeps your attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, Although the novelty of Snakes of a Plane doesn\&#39;t wear off, but you\&#39;ll leave the cinema thinking &#34;what was all the fuss about&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this movie has a high rating, but it doesn\&#39;t add up. A) Many of the reviews where written before the film was released and, B) The breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77% of people rating the movie 10/10, with only 7% of people giving it 9/10 - Why such an enormous gap?&#39;,
   &#34;For a comedic writer, Woody Allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development. There are a few entertaining moments, but no more than one would have listening to their dryer tumbling tennis balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but again, didn&#39;t have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie. The movie is so heavy and dull that it cannot be carried but if it were carried, Radha Mitchell did it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy movies that go on and on in one scene and don&#39;t really accomplish anything but to show that their writer can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion, then you&#39;ll love this movie.&#34;,
   &#34;I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers&#39; imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.&#34;,
   &#39;Roeg has done some great movies, but this a turkey. It has a feel of a play written by an untalented high-school student for his class assignment. The set decoration is appealing in a somewhat surrealistic way, but the actual story is insufferable hokum.&#39;,
   &#34;Here&#39;s why the Jane Show won&#39;t work. Once again Canadian bonehead producers and writers can&#39;t create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it. I guess these people don&#39;t watch a lot of T.V. from the U.S. which has the sitcom model down pat. No, here we have to do something different, we have to make the A story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful B story to try to make up for it. The characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top: Forklift races??? give me freaking break. Here&#39;s a little advice for the writers of the show, Don&#39;t write funny situations, find the funny in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff, not just be an improv monkey.&#34;,
   &#39;Hi, May be because I am not a Theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher ... I think this movie is &#34;Boring&#34; and &#34;Dumb&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and it\&#39;s title ... but boy what a waste of time ... just watching 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie on this DVD was so &#34;DARK&#34; ... I had hard time watching the darn movie ... I realize it is a 1968 movie ... but they are putting it on a DVD then they should do some digital remastering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was totally surprised to see these high marks on IMDb for this movie ... like I said before I am not as sophisticated as the other folks who commented on this movie earlier.&#39;,
   &#34;Make up your own mind. Personally I found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from Stevie Wonder. No offense Mr. Wonder. Maybe it is comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids; Wheeler(Seann William Scott)and Danny(Paul Rudd),two energy drink salesmen, to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny(Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie(Bobb&#39;e J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is Augie(Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies. Supporting are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.&#34;,
   &#39;- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over until and is determined to clean-up the town. Not everyone in town, however, is happy with what she\&#39;s doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in town, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. There\&#39;s no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There\&#39;s a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There are just so many things wrong with the movie: a supporting cast with no acting ability, stilted and unnatural dialogue, and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is the editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for Corman to yell &#34;Action&#34;. The best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building. All of a sudden, they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles. Or, take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town. We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It\&#39;s not as if Corman didn\&#39;t have a few decent actors to work with. While none were great stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance. But, in Gunslinger, they\&#39;re not given much to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have now seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would strongly recommend going the MST3K route.&#39;,
   &#34;Unbelievable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this film gets a 7 out 0f 10. This has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years. not only was the acting incredibly bad, the storyline (if you can call it that) was just as bad. Offcourse everyone knows what&#39;s going to happen within the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment. That however, is not the case. There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the 2 leading actors. It was unfortunately a waste of my time, and certainly a waste of my money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the 2 of merely for trying&#34;,
   &#34;I love Seth Green. His appearances on THat 70s&#39; Show is always worth watching but last night, I felt the show needed to overhauled. Four single young guys inherit a New York City apartment that most of us would die for. The grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place. So I felt the need for realism should have been brought out. Anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable. I would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show&#39;s set up. There did not seem to be much humor in it. I am only watching it because it falls before My Name is Earl on a winning Thursday night. I think they should go back, scrap this series, and start over. We need more family involved series. How about Seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down. THey could have Dabney Coleman play the father and Christine Estabrook, play the mother and dysfunctional siblings. The list of possibilities with somebody like Seth Green are endless and the network is blowing it.&#34;,
   &#34;Horror/Sci-Fi that is interesting as it is laughable. F/X pretty good...for what you manage to see. A made for TV thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. The horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment. Of course, after laughing and stammering in awe...Coombs&#39; creation, by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead, is let loose to hunt down one by one his father&#39;s colleagues. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.&#34;,
   &#39;A bad rip-off attempt on &#34;Seven&#34;, complete with sub-second-grade acting, awful camera work, half-baked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yeah, them &#34;sex offenders&#34;, they live next door and you\&#39;re gonna get raped, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No surprises from the vice-terminatrix woman, she acts as always -- as convincingly as a piece of wood. Richard Gere keeps on sliding lower and lower -- and is about as low here as a late Steven Seagal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when she\&#39;s dead in bed; and even the wolf was sub-par (although she was the best performer in the movie) -- maybe they fed her before the shots, or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike &#34;Seven&#34;, which had a (made up, but interesting) story, to which one could relate more or less regardless of the country, this movie seems to focus on a US-only obsession. If one doesn\&#39;t care much about &#34;sex offenders&#34; -- and the statistics are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain, suffering and death -- there is little reason to see it, or to be afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some body part fetishes and some snuff, but the gore is less then mediocre, and fails both as artistic device (because it is pointless) and as gore, because it is not gory enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t waste time on this one.&#39;,
   &#34;Josh Hartnett&#39;s dead eyes, the thick writing of it, and Harrison Ford being in a buddy-cop comedy ! Here&#39;s 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it, and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buddy-cop movies are fun. However their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s. Making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of Hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask God to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than (Hollywood Homicide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really did happen to this entertaining formula ?! Since a whole decade the things hadn&#39;t been the same. You&#39;d have a buddy-action stubborn flop after another. I&#39;ll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well : (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky &amp; Hutch - 2004), and the worst of them all yet (Miami Vice - 2006) ! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and TV shows during 2 decades already. Add to that, particularly here, the negligent dealing and the dull humor. Actually the matter this time is totally unbearable. Yes, we&#39;ve got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs, and the background of sinful city, but what else was new ?! It&#39;s not about cliché; it&#39;s about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting, especially from (Hartnett)&#39;s side, is terrible. This guy is anything but a comedian (or actor !). So his character was wanting to revenge for his father&#39;s death ! Revenge on yourself man, he probably died out of watching your acting !!. Even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy (or that&#39;s what they seemed here anyhow !).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh, some parts managed to be highly dull (arresting the black guy through the lack ??) ; it&#39;s a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action/comedy ! They didn&#39;t utilize Hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm, or even as a place which&#39;s full of shining or fallen stars (cameos that could&#39;ve given it few interesting moments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars&#39; glamour, and as being a Buddy-cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself ! Guess who ?!), and a Buddy-Cop destroyer more than movie ! God, don&#39;t make me, or my children, live enough to witness (Hollywood Homicide \x96 Part 2) ! At last, look at Harrison Ford&#39;s performance, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we didn&#39;t.&#34;,
   &#34;Monika Mitchell&#39;s showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence. I wouldn&#39;t say blood-soaked; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo(John Cassini)is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen, but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after. There is always a producer&#39;s nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks. Well, the best thing to do is get rid of the competition...Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, push and shot away. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, that&#39;s show business...or is it?&#34;,
   &#34;I don&#39;t know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but maybe he shouldn&#39;t have bothered. As another commenter mentioned, there isn&#39;t really enough horror or erotica to bring in fans of either genre. The plot is incoherent, the Sade sequences are gratuitous, and most of the acting is so-so. Englund was doing his best with weak material, and Zoe Trilling has a really great bottom, but neither is enough to carry this film. This one&#39;s a tape-over. Grade: F&#34;,
   &#34;*****THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS - but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well-known story*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CINDERELLA story ranks as my favorite fairy tale. The world will never have enough of this wonderful tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale. This cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cinderella story is more like an Ugly Duckling that never hatches or rather, is never transformed into a swan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the production value that money can buy, cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development - or good acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entrance of Cinderella at the ball as so poorly done, there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing made me very nervous, too. The Prince Charming was the most undesirable of memory. Why would any girl want to marry a boorish, self-absorbed prince who disliked women? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turner&#39;s turn on the Stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one-liners more than acting nuance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the Cinderella part held little interest or sympathy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt: So cheaply &#39;90&#39;s,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography, matte work and production design. It was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes, sets and settings as the story unfolded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some Cinderella storytelling, go for two gems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Rodgers and Hammerstein&#39;s Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious stagey TV - 60&#39;s look to the sets, this is the best version on celluloid - bar none. An all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment. Engaging, diverting and memorable writing and music. This is the classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Ever After- this Drew Barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective, alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale. The characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well.&#34;,
   &#39;I really can\&#39;t say anything bad *or* good about this thing. Its characters are likable enough, it\&#39;s capably produced and designed, and professional-looking (except for that cheesy monster suit). However, it has no originality, no ideas, and nothing you haven\&#39;t seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and/or OUTLAND. It\&#39;s just another formula, cookie-cutter, &#34;grimy corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster&#34; flick. Pretty much a waste of time.&#39;,
   &#34;Tim (Gary Daniels) wants desperately to break into serious television reporting. When a job he begged for goes awry, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) says sayonara, too. Coming home, Tim is startled to discover his house has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! Calling him Uncle Martin, Tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth. But, Martin gets in trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry room and more. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to make time with Tim but the course of true love does not run smooth in this case, either. Soon everyone in television is stalking Tim, hoping for a story about a true alien. What&#39;s a man to do? For those who loved the old television show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots. Its truly, undeniably awful, with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects which fall flat, too. Daniels is okay as the earthling but Lloyd is simply terrible as the alien, overacting up a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as are the costumes, set, and production details. Even if your children see the cover and beg for this film, convince them to pick out another flick at the video store. Be assured, kids and adults will find this movie a colossal bore, so opt for A Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 Days instead.&#34;,
   &#34;Spoken like a true hard-boiled u&#39;an gangsta. The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u&#39;an accent. Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah well, the script ain&#39;t too hot either. Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the while.&#34;,
   &#39;The sitcom &#34;The league of Gentlemen&#34; follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village &#34;Royston Vasey&#34;. The different scenes are linked together by their common setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first series, a sketch show, the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through Royston Vasey. Consequently, more foreigners visit the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a &#34;local&#34; shop, which is actually far away from the town, do not like foreigners. Whenever a visitor enters their shop, they kill him. In my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all, for example, when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road. Edward drums, while Tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the local Job Centre. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to loose her job. So when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman, she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about &#34;her&#34; sexual conversion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore the vet, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals instead of curing them. In one case, he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room, where a dog lays in his basket. The farmer goes outside. On the assumption that the dog is the sick animal, Mr. Chinnery euthanizes him. A second later, the farmer opens the door, holding the &#34;real&#34; sick animal, a sheep, in his hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew (his friend is killed by the shop owners, by the way). The couple is very tidy. They have, for example, towels in different colours. Each colour stands for one part of the body. Besides, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colours and precisely classified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the actors play very well. By playing women, the scenes become comical. The costumes are suited to the actors, too. Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, for example Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show has a great deal of dark humour, typical British. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look grey and are decayed. Around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect. Even the village sign is ominous: &#34;Welcome to Royston Vasey. You will never leave.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I think that the actors do a great job, this type of series is not my taste.&#39;,
   &#39;Ever since I started visiting this site, and voting for movies, I have never given any movie a rating of 1. Even the disturbing &#34;Dance! Workout with Barbie&#34; got a 2. There is a reason for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time I find myself watching what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: &#34;Is this movie really as bad as the horrific soul-sucking beast that is \&#39;Theodore Rex\&#39;?&#34; And I\&#39;ve never been able to answer &#34;yes&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said &#34;Hey! Let\&#39;s remake \&#39;Blade Runner\&#39; with Barney in the Harrison Ford Role!&#34; and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film. Furthermore, I want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadn\&#39;t gone strait to video. This is that rare monster: a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults. I\&#39;d ask &#34;what were they THINKING?&#34; but in this case, it might actually be redundant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you\&#39;re one of the five or six rabid fans of &#34;Howard the Duck&#34;, or if you are curious to see the most Evil Insane movie of all time, or you want to REALLY punish yourself.&#39;,
   &#39;Yuck. I thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written. The acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times. Why would a &#34;demonico&#34; kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal? Just for the heck of it? And is it really necessary to show Lilith\&#39;s motorcycle whenever she\&#39;s out somewhere. We get it! You spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket. It doesn\&#39;t mean you have to show it all the time! The &#34;Faith\&#39;s&#34; lair looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica set with some last minute changes. There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance. Everyone is a throwaway character. Forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movies I\&#39;ve seen the SciFi channel come out with. Stay away unless you\&#39;re into bad movies.&#39;,
   &#34;For the life of me I can&#39;t understand the good reviews on this piece of crap. It was pointless. Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I&#39;ll reiterate, why the stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And her acting was just bad. I don&#39;t know if she was thrown by the accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the girl Modine was in love with, suddenly she&#39;s shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way? Where did that come from? I think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble, but frankly, I couldn&#39;t care less about any of these people.&#34;,
   &#39;An okay film, with a fine leading lady, but a terrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a truly bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the movie\&#39;s saving grace. She\&#39;s the best actor of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE* the first comment, by the fellow who heaped praise upon the movie (and, according to his IMDB.com account, has only written ONE review -- and guess for what movie?) is obviously a plant. While the movie is nicely shot, it\&#39;s by no means subtle or great or whatever other hypobolic descriptions the reviewer used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Art of Revenge&#34; is a fair movie, but it\&#39;s a big tease. It offers up all manner of sexual situations but never goes through with it. Like watching a Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with all the &#34;naughty bits&#34; edited out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film, as a whole, is a bit unfocused and the ending, and much of the third act, is really a big mess. There\&#39;s a twist ending, of course, since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 4 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;,
   &#34;The writer/director of this film obviously doesn&#39;t know anything about film. I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey, because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was awful, the characters were very one dimensional. For someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans, that someone is kidding their self (it was probably the writer/director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. To go into a casino and play a few hands doesn&#39;t give you the experience to write about poker. Keep your day job. And if it&#39;s playing poker, then you must be hurt&#39;n.&#34;,
   &#39;This is the official sequel to the \&#39;92 sci-fi action thriller. In the original, Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this one, it\&#39;s, I guess, about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter about that age. Now he\&#39;s working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer (named Seth - like the snake in &#34;King Cobra&#34; the same year) goes power-crazy, takes command of the Unisols, and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We\&#39;re lookin\&#39; at the next step in evolution, folks! Most of Van Damme\&#39;s fights are with one particularly mean Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps on comin\&#39;: drop him off a building - no good; run him down with a truck - no go! Shoot him, burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classed(he\&#39;s even going grey around the edges). But, though he takes a lickin\&#39;, he keeps on kickin\&#39;! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals, and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius, it manages to be consistently entertaining, especially if you\&#39;re a pro-wrestling fan.&#39;,
   &#39;Rosie wasted a lot of TV time talking about the Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows it. What kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick ( with an obvious black daddy, cousins and auntie)pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day Puerto Ricans,but barely mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish is spoken, the food and music. She is so typical and I lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does. Also, since she wants to dance around her African-ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness (i.e. Lackawanna Blues). We can find a prideful Black Latina next time (thank you Zoe Saldana,Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the Puerto Rican on here that said they are African and not &#34;black&#34;....thank you. We &#34;blacks&#34; certainly do not have anything in common with &#34;you&#34; so there is no love lost. But, since you are probably in the States and have benefited from the Civil Rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood ,sweat and tears from the backs of the &#34;blacks&#34; you share nothing with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am correct Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media, but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations. However, you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior...you are not. Also, you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is BET...again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood. Try visiting Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Trust me none of those blacks want to claim your &#34;culture&#34; either.&#39;,
   &#39;Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of the Math, technology, or history constituting the film\&#39;s subject, but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This hits a sore spot with me, as I\&#39;ve long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion, eg: Emmy Coer: &#34;information waves have a half-life&#34;, Ada: &#34;I\&#39;m not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts. It\&#39;s more likely, I think, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic.&#39;,
   &#34;In 1972, after his wife left to go her own way, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a good-humored, long haired, lovely, statuesque beauty queen, is charted to fill a void in Elvis&#39; life. When Elvis&#39; divorce became final, Linda was already in place as the legendary performer&#39;s live-in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship. Linda whole-heartedly tending to her lover&#39;s needs and desires. And even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium. At times this movie is harsh and dark of heart; a very unattractive look at the &#39;King&#39; and his queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Johnson is absolutely awful as Elvis. Over acting to the hilt is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks the classiness of Linda, but does the job pretty well. Supporting cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee, and Rick Lenz. Watching this twice is more than enough for me, but don&#39;t let this review stop you from checking it out. For most Elvis fans that I have conferred with, this is not a favored presentation.&#34;,
   &#39;Or maybe that\&#39;s what it feels like. Anyway, &#34;The Bat People&#34; is about as flat as a rug, bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock...and as intelligent as all three combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, plot in a nutshell (fitting vessel, that...): a doctor (Moss) gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and subsequently turns into a bat - well, not exactly a bat but a bat-like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first-person camera viewpoint....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then there\&#39;s the business of the sheriff (Pataki), who is about the WORST kind of sheriff: the hick kind. He hassles people, he leers at married women, he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries (the FIEND!), he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time, making him look and sound like Buford T. Justice in &#34;Smokey and the Bandit&#34; and (this is the worst part)... HE\&#39;S THE MOST LIKEABLE CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE FILM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole film, though, is just TV movie-of-the-week-like crapola (guano, in this case). It\&#39;s an AIP, for crying out loud! What did you expect, Oscar caliber stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what else can you say about a film that not even MST3K can save?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about...no stars for &#34;The Bat People&#34;, full version OR MST3K version!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if there\&#39;s ever a sequel for this movie, I\&#39;m burying my TV.&#39;,
   &#39;I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came on IMDb to check out the comments. A comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog. I never go by other people\&#39;s opinions, so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. It had to be one of the WORST movies I\&#39;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. Since when do scary movies have sappy scenes? I swear, I\&#39;m amazed there weren\&#39;t any GROUP HUG ^-^ moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I jumped. Once. And that\&#39;s because I zoned out, thinking about my research paper for English. The clichéd, birds/cat popping out of nowhere thing when you THOUGHT something was gonna happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost DIED laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, &#34;I have to get my mom\&#39;s shawl!!!&#34; You. Idiot. Screw the shawl! Safety is just a few steps away, but NO, my mom\&#39;s shawl (that didn\&#39;t match the dress By the way) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it all off, they take her BACK to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie. And not just the, I bet he\&#39;s hiding under the bed, moments. It was the, &#34;HE stole the bellhop\&#39;s clothes and sneaked out of the hotel&#34; and &#34;It\&#39;s the detective coming down the hallway, not the killer!&#34; moments. Movies should NEVER be THIS predictable. Disney movies aren\&#39;t even this predictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m gonna complete my rant now by saying, this was a terrible movie. I\&#39;m glad I went to see it in theaters so I wouldn\&#39;t buy it for $15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would\&#39;ve been better if only one thing would\&#39;ve happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on his way down. Oh, how lovely that would\&#39;ve been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t waste your time or money. Go see a GOOD movie.&#39;,
   &#39;They should have called this movie: &#34;Adopted Mouse Brother That is Slightly Inspired by Someone\&#39;s Vague Recollection of Stuart Little Who Just Kind of Skimmed the Book a Little, But Mostly Just Remembered the Cover&#34; If it wasn\&#39;t so misleading I\&#39;d give it a better review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously people, do your kids a favor and have them read the book. They might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as Hollywood film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book Stuart little isn\&#39;t about a mouse, it\&#39;s about a person who happens to be very small and mouse-like. He\&#39;s born to his parents, not adopted. The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks he\&#39;s food and wants to eat him, but Snowball can\&#39;t talk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the movie they screw all of that up. I think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.&#39;,

This is generally a good idea as it allows you to see how each of the further processing steps affects the reviews and it also ensures that the data has been loaded correctly.</p>

<pre>just saw this exquisite 1982 movie Return of the Soldier, based on Rebecca West&#39;s novel. Its about a shell-shocked fortyish Captain who doesn&#39;t even tell his wife he has returned to British soil, but remains in a hospital in London. He&#39;s lost his memory and is a boy again, with a lingering yen for the lower class sweetheart he pursued 25 years earlier. Its a delicate story. He is lingering in his boyhood, while the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable, aspiring socialite who wants him to resume his place in society. Living with them is his cousin Jenny, who loved Chris Baldry the soldier, when they were growing up as playmates, but has settled into spinsterhood. The lower class woman, played by Glenda Jackson, is Margaret Gray. It is SHE who is notified that Chris is back in England. Chris&#39; wife Kitty is shocked when Mrs. Gray comes to tell her that Chris is in a hospital in London. Kitty (Julie Christie) is vacuous and snobbish. Why, she asks herself, was this other woman sent a telegraph about Chris rather than her? Chris has forgotten totally about Kitty. He wants to renew his relationship with Margaret. The now married Margaret is reluctant to meet him, but then does and continues to meet with him. There is a psychiatrist (Ian Holm) who warns Kitty and Jenny that Chris&#39; temporary happiness with Margaret will disappear if he &#39;cures&#39; him. Jenny realizes how empty Kitty is for Chris and forms a secret loving alliance through Margaret. They both are in love with him. Jenny wants to help. Late in the film Kitty reveals that Chris and she had a boy who died five years ago. Telling Chris this, weighs the Shrink, will certainly restore him to &#39;normal.&#39; But is this a good idea? Chris, barely aware that he and Kitty were ever married, is unaware of his child and the child&#39;s death. The psychiatrist, just learning of the child, believes such knowledge will restore Chris. Jenny and Margaret have Chris all to themselves because Kitty believes he is faking and refuses to accept Chris&#39;s illness in reverting to his youth in his forties. The film leaves her mostly out of consideration concerning whats to be done with Chris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Jenny and Margaret, in the child&#39;s perfectly maintained bedroom- with Kitty too in the novel, but not in the screenplay- discuss what they believe should be done about Chris from their separate perspectives. Margaret is the critical one here, because, though married, she has half fallen in love with Chris again. Jenny&#39;s social stature, Jenny believes, will be threatened if Chris does not right himself. She does not reveal this to Margaret, however. Margaret decides, looking ahead, that Chris cannot maintain his fantasy over time, but must return to something like a real life. While Kitty and Jenny look on from the window of the house, Margaret approaches Chris outside and tells him of his lost son. The buoyant war victim&#39;s head sinks, his shoulders slump, he looks away. He walks dejectedly toward the house. Fin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some criticism of this first novel of Rebecca West. The novel was written something after the first war. The movie is never quite clear who Jenny is, his cousin or his sister. It would be more rousing if she were his sister, of course. The criticism doesn&#39;t make it clear either. I&#39;m sure West in her novel, makes sure Jenny is her cousin, not her sister. West is no Henry Miller nor an Anais Nin, whose book Incest (about her relationship with her father as an adult to get even with him for molesting her as a child) I considered reading, but then decided against. Rebecca the author has a need to restore Chris too. She too has outposts in her head for the Society her novel excoriates first but finally embraces once more.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Above we mentioned that <code>review_to_words</code> method removes html formatting and allows us to tokenize the words found in a review, for example, converting <em>entertained</em> and <em>entertaining</em> into <em>entertain</em> so that they are treated as though they are the same word. What else, if anything, does this method do to the input?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The method also converts all characters to lowercase, splits string into words, removes stopwords (such as "the", "a", "an", "in", etc) and normalizes / stems text (e.g. changing playing to play)</p>

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By truncating / padding, we may end up with incorrect / irrelevant data. On a positive note, it gives some consistency to the data and model which would help with training. However, model accuracy could be impacted in a negative way.</li>
<li>Overall, it would help to have both the training and testing sets go through the same process to keep things consistent. This helps build confidence when making predictions because both data sets went through the same transformation process.</li>

<li>Model Artifacts,</li>
<li>Training Code, and</li>

<p>each of which interact with one another. In the XGBoost example we used training and inference code that was provided by Amazon. Here we will still be using containers provided by Amazon with the added benefit of being able to include our own custom code.</p>
<p>We will start by implementing our own neural network in PyTorch along with a training script.

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

<p>In order to construct a PyTorch model using SageMaker we must provide SageMaker with a training script. We may optionally include a directory which will be copied to the container and from which our training code will be run.

This is the Python file which will be executed when the model is trained. Inside of the <code>train</code> directory is a file called <code>train.py</code> which has been provided and which contains most of the necessary code to train our model. The only thing that is missing is the implementation of the <code>train()</code> method which you wrote earlier in this notebook.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Copy the <code>train()</code> method written above and paste it into the <code>train/train.py</code> file where required.</p>
<p>The way that SageMaker passes hyperparameters to the training script is by way of arguments. These arguments can then be parsed and used in the training script. To see how this is done take a look at the provided <code>train/train.py</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This model did not perform as well as the XGBoost model. What could make the difference are the number of epochs for training each moodel and the architecture of each model.</p>
<p>After doing some research, I also found that XGBoost is better for tabular data with less variables while NN-based deep learning models is better for images with large number of variables. Given this research, XGBoost could be better for sentiment analysis.</p>

<p>Recall in the first section of this notebook we did a bunch of data processing to the IMDb dataset. In particular, we did two specific things to the provided reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed any html tags and stemmed the input</li>
<li>Encoded the review as a sequence of integers using <code>word_dict</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In order process the review we will need to repeat these two steps.</p>

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

<h3 id="Deploying-the-model">Deploying the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Deploying-the-model">&#182;</a></h3><p>Now that the custom inference code has been written, we will create and deploy our model. To begin with, we need to construct a new PyTorchModel object which points to the model artifacts created during training and also points to the inference code that we wish to use. Then we can call the deploy method to launch the deployment container.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array. In our case we want to send a string so we need to construct a simple wrapper around the <code>RealTimePredictor</code> class to accomodate simple strings. In a more complicated situation you may want to provide a serialization object, for example if you wanted to sent image data.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>Select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown menu and click <strong>Create Method</strong>. A new blank method will be created, select its dropdown menu and select <strong>POST</strong>, then click on the check mark beside it.</p>
<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.</p>
<p>The last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown and click on <strong>Deploy API</strong>. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example <code>prod</code>.</p>
<p>You have now successfully set up a public API to access your SageMaker model. Make sure to copy or write down the URL provided to invoke your newly created public API as this will be needed in the next step. This URL can be found at the top of the page, highlighted in blue next to the text <strong>Invoke URL</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Step-4:-Deploying-our-web-app">Step 4: Deploying our web app<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-4:-Deploying-our-web-app">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have a publicly available API, we can start using it in a web app. For our purposes, we have provided a simple static html file which can make use of the public api you created earlier.</p>
<p>In the <code>website</code> folder there should be a file called <code>index.html</code>. Download the file to your computer and open that file up in a text editor of your choice. There should be a line which contains <strong>**REPLACE WITH PUBLIC API URL**</strong>. Replace this string with the url that you wrote down in the last step and then save the file.</p>
<p>Now, if you open <code>index.html</code> on your local computer, your browser will behave as a local web server and you can use the provided site to interact with your SageMaker model.</p>
<p>If you'd like to go further, you can host this html file anywhere you'd like, for example using github or hosting a static site on Amazon's S3. Once you have done this you can share the link with anyone you'd like and have them play with it too!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Important Note</strong> In order for the web app to communicate with the SageMaker endpoint, the endpoint has to actually be deployed and running. This means that you are paying for it. Make sure that the endpoint is running when you want to use the web app but that you shut it down when you don't need it, otherwise you will end up with a surprisingly large AWS bill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Make sure that you include the edited <code>index.html</code> file in your project submission.</p>

<p>Now that your web app is working, trying playing around with it and see how well it works.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Give an example of a review that you entered into your web app. What was the predicted sentiment of your example review?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I tried different reviews to test POSITVE and NEGATIVE. There are reviews that I got from the internet.</p>
<p>I expected this one to be a POSITVE review which is what the web app predicted:</p>
<blockquote><p>DC's Wonder woman is yet another flagship movie in time when Dark knight franchise has ended and DC is struggling to make their impact again . Patty Jenkins's impressive directorial skills with gorgeous &amp; fierce Gal gadot's  electrifying performance are lead powerhouse of this cash pouring successful franchise . Powerful CGI effects with captivating cinematography and illuminating original score ensures that it shouldn't be missed if your are sci fi lover . This movie established Gal gadot as successful actress on box office her captivating beauty with extraordinary fight sequences as princess Diana made everyone fall in love with her. Thanks to outstanding VFX technology we have today that turned movie watching in absolutely mind blowing experience . Script , screenplay is good with excellent editing ,sound mixing . It's sequel is on its way , do watch it in cinema it's immersive experience of beauty &amp; technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I expected this one to be a NEGATIVE review which is what the web app predicted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mad Dog Time is the first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time. Oh, I've seen bad movies before. But they usually made me care about how bad they were. Watching Mad Dog Time is like waiting for the bus in a city where you're not sure they have a bus line.</p>

<h3 id="Delete-the-endpoint">Delete the endpoint<a class="anchor-link" href="#Delete-the-endpoint">&#182;</a></h3><p>Remember to always shut down your endpoint if you are no longer using it. You are charged for the length of time that the endpoint is running so if you forget and leave it on you could end up with an unexpectedly large bill.</p>
